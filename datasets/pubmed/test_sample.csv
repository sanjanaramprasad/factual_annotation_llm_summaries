0," species identification is essential for large-scale biodiversity monitoring and conservation. several molecular methods have been employed for biodiversity studies, but traditional methods such as allozyme analysis are usually labor-intensive and irreproducible. because of advances in dna-based technologies, approaches such as dna arrays and dna barcoding have recently gained attention. both of these methods are based on comparative dna sequence analysis, but they have significant differences. micro- and macro-arrays rely on the hybridization of short specific nucleotide probes to dna from the target organism and subsequent detection of the hybridization signal. although array-based technologies have been widely used in gene expression studies, their use in biodiversity research has been less rigorous, mainly targeting pathogenic microorganisms and arrays of environmental samples. pfunder et al, however, have advocated an array-based method for the identification of voles and shrews for biodiversity monitoring. although this study focuses on a limited number of species, the authors have predicted that such an approach can be used for the development of a so called'mammalia chip', in the case of mammalian species, or even a'biodiversity chip' for monitoring key species of different taxa from bacteria to mammals. species identification by dna barcoding is based on sequencing a short standardized genomic region of the target specimen and comparing this information to a sequence library from known species. the proposed standard barcode sequence for animal species is a 650-bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase i. this dna barcode has successfully been used for the identification of species in various vertebrate and invertebrate groups from birds to lepidoptera, and in different geographical settings from the arctic to the tropics. additionally, smaller fragments of the standard coi barcode –'mini-barcodes' – have been shown to be effective for species identification in specimens whose dna is degraded or potentially in other situations where obtaining a full-length barcode is not feasible. barcoding is now being extended to other groups such as fungi, plants and protists, and the barcode of life initiative has gained international momentum by the establishment of the consortium for the barcode of life, which plans to assemble dna barcode libraries for all fish and birds. here, we compare the design and applicability of both array-based and barcoding platforms for specimen identification in mammalian species. we have chosen mammals because they constitute an important target for biodiversity studies and include many endangered species. however, mammalian species have not been broadly targeted for developing array-based or barcoding identification systems previously. a rapid identification method will aid in the tracking of illegal trafficking of mammalian species and their tissues. we have selected two mitochondrial loci for our analysis: coi – the proposed standard animal dna barcode – and cytochrome b, which is commonly used as a species-level marker and particularly so in mammalian biosystematics. we used both of these genes to test the possibility of designing a mammalia chip. we also used these sequences and various size fragments of them to test the feasibility of dna barcoding analysis for mammalian species. we targeted three datasets of mammalian species for these analyses: species across the taxonomy of mammals, a dense sampling of species of neotropical bats, and a wide geographical sampling of a single genetically diverse bat species.  array-based analysis both coi and cytb performed well as templates for probe design in mammalian dataset. however, we observed a sharp decline in the number of unique probes in species as haplotype diversity increased. for example, no 25mer probe in either coi or cytb was shared by all humans but also distinct from other species. we dealt with this limitation by choosing three probes from each species so that at least two probes should exactly match sequences within the target species. another consideration was to ensure that the probes match among the first bases from the 5' end of the target genes. this is important as coi and cytb are longer than kb and are difficult to amplify in their entirety in samples with degraded dna. our algorithm provided coi and cytb probes for % and % of the species in this mammalian dataset, respectively. as for the bat dataset, we found a somewhat similar result and were able to design probes for % of the species in this assemblage. dna barcoding analysis whole coi and cytb delivered similar results for the mammalian dataset, identifying all the species in our assemblage in a neighbor-joining analysis. the standard animal barcode – a bp fragment at the 5' end of coi – identified % of the species. the same fragment size of cytb provided % species-level resolution. significantly, mini-barcodes of coi and cytb were also capable of discriminating among species of mammals, although the resolution was somewhat lower. interestingly, in the coi data we found that a mini-barcode positioned at nucleotides 437– provided the same resolution for species identification as the standard barcode sequence. in contrast, all the cytb mini-barcodes provided lower resolution as compared to a barcode-size fragment of the cytb gene. the results obtained in the nj analysis were confirmed when we plotted the sequence length against the probability of obtaining a unique sequence for each species. interestingly, we found that the minimum signal required to provide unique barcodes in about 95% of the species in the mammalian dataset is a short ~ base fragment of the 5' region of either the coi barcode or cytb gene, but the resolution decreases sharply with smaller sequences. cytb res, resolution in neighbor-joining analysis; k2p, genetic distances based on kimura two-parameter nucleotide substitution model; var, variable sites. an evaluation of coi barcodes in a dataset with lower taxonomic diversity but with a somewhat higher density of sampling within a confined taxonomic assemblage – individuals of species of neotropical bats – showed a 100% resolution for species identification. similar to the mammalian dataset, mini-barcodes of bases were also capable of discriminating among more than 95% of the species in this bat dataset. in addition, the minimum signal required to provide unique barcodes in more than 95% of the species of bats was a short ~ base fragment of the 5' region of coi. comparison of coi and cytb in individuals of one of these species, sturnira lilium, across sampling localities in central and south america suggests that both genes provide similar resolution and can detect three geographical variants within this species. similar resolution is achieved by using mini-barcodes of both coi and cytb for this species. res, resolution in neighbor-joining analysis; k2p, genetic distances based on kimura two-parameter nucleotide substitution model; var, variable sites. discussion this study reveals that both arrays and barcodes are useful tools for the species-level identification of mammals. the main limitation of the array-based approach is that it requires advance knowledge of sequences in target species. because of a lack of exact matches, undiscovered haplotypes or geographic variants could fail to anneal properly to the probes on the array. while we tried to avoid this problem by providing a set of three different probes per species, this factor can substantially limit the use of microarrays for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. additionally, to explore unknown species in a given taxonomic group, it might be possible to design probe sets that specifically bind to members of a higher taxonomic level such as genus or family. however, in a situation such as s. lilium, with different geographical variants of up to 8% sequence variation in their coi/cytb genes, a probe set that is designed for the species in one locality might not bind to members of the species in other localities. this hit or miss situation could make array technology less desirable in biodiversity monitoring across a wide geographic region. in fact, the current applications of microarrays are usually focused on a limited number of taxa. because of this, assembling a'mammalia chip' might not be a feasible approach for biodiversity monitoring of all mammalian species. because barcoding is a sequencing-based technology, it avoids the problem of unknown haplotypes. new haplotypes can be compared to existing databases of barcodes, and they can be assigned to a particular species using probabilistic algorithms. the final assignment of a new haplotype to a described species or its assignment to a new species will be achieved through comprehensive taxonomic analysis, which requires different types of data. our analysis supports this argument in all three datasets. while smaller fragments were less powerful in resolving some closely-related species, obtaining more sequence information in these cases can increase the resolution. however, while standard barcode-size fragments can be readily obtained in a single pcr amplification/sequencing from freshly collected or frozen tissue specimens, it is difficult to obtain 650-bp barcodes from specimens whose dna is degraded. the high effectiveness of mini-barcodes means that biomonitoring through barcodes can target different types of specimens, including museum samples or traces of tissues with degraded dna. the mini-barcode strategy also enables exploration of the use of massively parallel sequencing platforms, such as pyrosequencing-based life sciences sequencers, for barcoding applications. interestingly, this technology uses an emulsion pcr approach for simultaneous amplification of several thousand 100– base dna molecules in one reaction. this approach will therefore allow the use of mini-barcodes on environmental samples, which have traditionally been targets for array-based technology. this study also provides evidence that both coi and cytb are useful species-level molecular markers for mammalian species. this finding is in agreement with earlier work. however, when it comes to selecting a molecular marker, it is also important to consider operational issues such as the availability of robust pcr primers, standardization across a wide range of taxa, the robustness of amplifying shorter fragments in pcr reactions of degraded dna, and the prevalence of mitochondrial nuclear pseudogenes. our study further confirms that the standard coi barcode can be applied to mammalian species with a similar high species-level resolution as has been observed in other animal taxa tested.  dna-based methods such as dna arrays and dna barcodes provide substantial potential for biodiversity monitoring. however, as the scale of analysis increases, for example in large biodiversity surveys or analysis across wide taxonomic assemblages or different types of specimens, the scalability and sensitivity of these approaches become critical issues in their applicability. our analyses using three different datasets of mammalian species spanning a wide range of taxa, suggest both dna arrays and dna barcodes provide high resolution across mammalian species. because dna arrays might fail to anneal to undiscovered haplotypes of a given species, their use is limited to taxa with known sequences. dna barcoding, however, provides a higher flexibility for the identification of species in large taxonomic assemblages because it is based on obtaining sequence information that can be used for linking unknown haplotypes to known species. "," the rapid and accurate identification of species is a critical component of large-scale biodiversity monitoring programs. dna arrays and dna barcodes are two molecular approaches that have recently garnered much attention. here, we compare these two platforms for identification of an important group, the mammals.  our analyses, based on the two commonly used mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase i and cytochrome b, suggest that both arrays and barcodes are capable of discriminating mammalian species with high accuracy. we used three different datasets of mammalian species, comprising different sampling strategies. for dna arrays we designed three probes for each species to address intraspecific variation. as for dna barcoding, our analyses show that both cytochrome c oxidase i and cytochrome b genes, and even smaller fragments of them can successfully discriminate species in a wide variety of specimens.  this study showed that dna arrays and dna barcodes are valuable molecular methods for biodiversity monitoring programs. both approaches were capable of discriminating among mammalian species in our test assemblages. however, because designing dna arrays require advance knowledge of target sequences, the use of this approach could be limited in large scale monitoring programs where unknown haplotypes might be encountered. dna barcodes, by contrast, are sequencing-based and therefore could provide more flexibility in large-scale studies.

1," rhodococcus equi is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens affecting foals up to six months of age and occasionally can cause diseases in other animal species including humans. typical manifestation of the infection in foals includes pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia with abscessation. epidemiology of the disease is similar worldwide: it occurs endemically on some farms and rarely strikes the others. the prevalence and severity of the disease on endemic farms may vary among seasons. r. equi infection in foals has been recognized and described in poland, but without any information about molecular characterization of r. equi isolates. recently, prevalence of r. equi in horse carcasses intended for human consumption was investigated in poland. single r. equi strain carried 85-kb type i plasmid was isolated from % samples of healthy middle tracheo-branchiales lymph nodes while no lymphocentrum retropharyngeum sample was positive. the virulence of r. equi is determined by genes vaps located on virulence-associated plasmids. isolates carrying the vapa gene encoding virulence-associated 15–17-kda protein are known as virulent and are capable of causing disease in foals. to date analysis of the restriction enzyme digestion patterns revealed distinct vapa types and some of them have geographical specificity. epidemiological studies on genetic relations among r. equi isolates are usually based on genotyping by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis method. some of the studies report that horses from individual regions or farms seem to harbor isolates with low genetic diversity. on the other side, the great diversity in the genotypes of isolates within and among farms or among countries also has been shown. furthermore, one foal can be infected with various r. equi isolates that vary in plasmid type and genotype. the aim of this study was to characterize types of virulence plasmids in isolates originating from polish farms and to determine the genetic diversity of the isolates.  totally isolates from horse farms were investigated. the isolate id and year of isolation are presented in fig.  the vapa gene specific for r. equi which is virulent for horses was detected in all isolates. however, the virulent vapa-positive isolate 635/ lost its plasmid during subculturing. thus, pfge was performed on whereas plasmid profiling on isolates.fig. dendrogram of virulent and plasmid cured isolates of r. equi obtained from foals from poland genotyped with vspi-pfge method. among the isolates ten pfge clusters were detected clusters among vapa-positive isolates, contained 85-kb type i plasmid, contained 87-kb type i plasmid. one isolate had a unique restriction cleavage pattern and the 2nd fragment of ecori digests of this plasmid dna was about bases smaller than that of the 85 kb type i. this new plasmid variant was designated as the “85-kb type v”.table plasmid profiles of vapa-positive r. equi fig. ecori restriction fragments of the plasmids of r. equi. lanes: 85-kb type i; line 85-kb type v all vapa-positive isolates were typeable with vspi-pfge, resulting in the detection of ten pfge clusters. the major cluster was shared by isolates from horse farms. cluster b was shared by isolates from farms, cluster c by isolates from farms. four isolates from farms belonged to cluster d and isolates from one farm belonged to cluster e. the remaining isolates exhibited various pulsed-field patterns. the most of investigated isolates belonged to three main clusters. part of them were indistinguishable and had the same pfge pattern despite the fact that they were isolated on various horse farms in various years. pfge patterns of the isolates were compared with virulence plasmid types and no concordance was observed. some of the isolates carried pvapa 85-kb type i, 87-kb type i, new variant 85-kb type v, as well as the one had lost the plasmid had the same pfge pattern. discussion the prevalence of plasmid 85-kb type i and 87-kb type i in poland is similar to other studies from europe as well as the usa, while in the south america 87-kb type i is most often isolated than 85-kb type i. new type of plasmid 85-kb type v might be a local type similar for example to 85-kb type iv in texas. we were not able to investigate plasmid type in one case because of the plasmid loss. the guidelines for molecular epidemiologic investigation using pfge assay indicate that the isolate characterization should only be applied to small sets of isolates related to potential outbreaks. in this study, investigated isolates met these criteria as the breeding horse population in poland is relatively small and mostly concentrated on several breeding farms and most of the isolates used in this study were collected in several years during r. equi outbreaks. the study has several limitations. firstly, it was a descriptive study: we used the isolates obtained from collaborators as diagnostic material. secondly, samples were obtained from all of the suspected horses only from a few farms and only during one or a few seasons. that’s the reason why the isolates from those farms are overrepresented in the analysis. most of the isolates from the other farms were isolated from individual samples delivered to the laboratory. no data concerning the number of suspected or affected foals on a farm were available. in conclusion, collected isolates and data were not sufficient for the proper statistical analysis and obtained results are only descriptive. our results are consistent with some previous data where a particular isolate or isolates with low genetic diversity are associated with the individual farms or regions. we identified the isolates typical for certain farms. for example almost all predominant isolates from the farm aa belonged to two main pfge clusters and most of them were indistinguishable. on the other hand, the same isolates occur on more than one farm, for example on the farms ai and al as well as bb and al. the high similarity of isolates on mentioned farms may be explained by the exchange of mares between them. mares shed r. equi with feces in which the pathogen may multiply and inhalation of virulent r. equi is the major route of infection of foals in the first few days of life. furthermore, the infected foals shed a large amount of vapa positive r. equi and this may explain why several major pulsotypes were widespread in the environment of endemic farms. moreover, the analyzed samples were collected mostly during outbreaks at relatively close time intervals. comparison of pfge patterns and plasmid type which was conducted in this study confirms previously indicated observations in horses, pigs cattle and wild boars. however, r. equi isolates containing the same plasmid type revealed different pfge patterns and isolates with identical pfge patterns contained different virulence plasmids or were plasmid-less. during the study we detected chromosomal variability among some of investigated isolates what had been previously described even among isolates collected from the same farm. however, these studies were performed on a high number of isolates from heterogeneous horse populations with numerous clinical cases and soil samples from many farms contrary to our study conducted on smaller farms that stay in contact, for example by exchange of the horses. given the limitations of this study we can only speculate that the persistence of farm-specific isolates might be possible on some horse farms with limited movement of horses in poland. moreover, our observations are supported by reports from germany and australia were particular isolates were associated with individual farms.  most clinical isolates of r. equi from foals in poland contain vapa plasmids 85-kb type i and 87-kb type i similar to the other european countries and the united states. there is a new variant of vapa plasmid identified as 85-kb type v. the chromosomal variability was detected among some investigated isolates, however farm-specific isolates appear to exist. "," rhodococcus equi is one of the most significant bacterial pathogens affecting foals up to 6 months of age worldwide. rhodococcosis is present in poland however information about molecular characterization of r. equi isolates is scarce. this study describes molecular characterization of rhodococcus equi infection on horse breeding farms in poland between and samples were collected by tracheobronchial aspiration from pneumonic foals or during necropsy. the r. equi isolates were genotyped by plasmid profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.  totally, r. equi isolates were investigated. one isolate lost its plasmid. among the vapa-positive isolates, contained 85-kb type i plasmid, contained 87-kb type i plasmid. one isolate had a unique restriction cleavage pattern and the 2nd fragment of ecori digests of this plasmid dna was about bases smaller than that of the 85 kb type i. this new plasmid variant was designated as the “85-kb type v”. among the isolates typeable with vspi-pfge, ten pfge clusters were detected. the majority of foals were infected mostly with isolates of low genetic diversity.  most of clinical isolates of r. equi from foals in poland contain pvapa 85-kb type i and 87-kb type i similarly to the other european countries and the united states. however, the new variant of pvapa 85-kb type v was identified. the chromosomal variability was detected among some of the investigated isolates and the presence of farm-specific isolates might be possible. keywords rhodococcosisepidemiologypfgehorseplasmid profilepolish state committee for scientific research p06k 27witkowski lucjan http://dx.doi.org/ /501100004281narodowe centrum naukin n 131638witkowski lucjan http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/ /501100004569ministerstwo nauki i szkolnictwa wyższegoknow scientific consortium ""healthy animal - safe food"" 05-1/know2/2015issue-copyright-statement© the author 2017 ",83343104-0ede-467d-8842-0d9930ad4d95,pubmed
2," light drives the processes of photosynthesis and plant development, and ultimately affects crop yield. the culmination of over a century of plant photobiology research shows that plants possess complicated photosensory networks that monitor and respond to a wide spectrum of ambient light energies. the spectral sensitivity of the plant light-sensors greatly exceeds the range of human vision, as light effects on physiology have been observed from energies arising from the uv-b wavebands into the near infra-red. this broad range of environmental information is processed by integrated signaling networks that tailor growth and development to best fit ambient light conditions. light sensing pathways have been dissected through use of narrow-bandwidth light sources. since individual photoreceptors are generally tuned to sense specific regions of the spectrum, narrow-bandwidth irradiation allows isolation of effects associated with a particular waveband. for instance, the phytochromes mediate responses to red and far-red light, with partial activity extended through the green, blue and near-uv wavebands. cryptochromes are required for maximal response to blue and uv-a, while the phototropins exhibit autophosphorylation when stimulated with light qualities from the blue-green interface to uv-c. other sensors share sensory overlap with the phototropins, and at least several other receptors remain to be characterized. narrow-bandwidth, research-quality light is typically generated using a broad spectrum source filtered through an infra-red heat sink and several layers of acetate theatre filters or colored plastic. fluorescent lamps also are used, as they emit three principle light qualities that can be readily filtered to obtain narrow-bandwidth light. led light has been used principally in studies of phytochrome reversibility, as switchable red and far-red led arrays are commercially available. many reports have demonstrated the utility of red/far-red led sources in modulating phytochrome responses during de-etiolation, modulation of root growth, root greening and senescence. led technology has been incorporated into lighting regimes to modulate plant growth and development for decades as acute supplementation of sunlight or as the basis of plant growth in commercial chambers. additionally, led-generated light is well-suited for small growth chambers and other applications where a significant fluence rate is required, but little physical space is available for conventional lamps. the practical aspects of led lighting make them particularly well-suited for space applications where light treatments need to be precise and reliable with little heat radiation and low weight. leds may also be especially useful in retrofitting incandescent or fluorescent growth chambers for terrestrial applications. there is a need for a light source that may facilitate plant growth in a chamber environment, yet still allow for dynamic variation in light quality and quantity for experimental studies. such devices may reveal interesting interactions between light sensing systems. recent findings demonstrate that even ""benign"" wavebands have significant influence in plant physiology in concert with red and blue light. in this report we detail the design and construction of a compact led light array for use in plant research. these light sources utilize norlux hex-led arrays and are capable of delivering – μmol m- s- of combined red, green, and/or blue light. the design allows precise fluence-rate control of individual wavebands, allowing growth of plants under different combinations of light energies. these designs are the same as those used to generate plant-growth data in a number of recent studies of red, blue and green light interaction. two designs are presented in figures the first is a plan that may be suitable for use in the laboratory or classroom for fewer than one thousand dollars. the second depicts an expandable system that may be appropriate for large growth chambers. together the two plans presented represent tested and proven designs to introduce efficient lighting to chambers where light quality, quantity, duration and mixture can be readily controlled.  the advent of new semiconductor technologies has inspired a marked decrease in the price of led-based devices. an increased number of consumer-grade products have become available to the researcher, and now these new tools may be integrated into various light-research applications. the goal of this work is to provide an interface between research needs and new technology. with this, the best-available research tools may be implemented by researchers without a significant investment in development. the plans presented herein offer two options for led light source construction, based on the need of an experimental illumination tool or requirement for large-area irradiation. led-based lighting regimes are being adopted by municipalities and medical facilities for their consistent, low-power, low-maintenance output. however, one of the most important practical applications of this technology is in the design for lighting regimes to support plant growth. it is of great interest to not only to foster plant growth, but to control plant growth. basic plant research has demonstrated that specific light wavebands may affect discrete aspects of plant physiology, such as germination, stem growth, biomass and the transition to flowering. the supplementation of specific wavebands or skewing of overall spectrum may help modulate the progression of these developmental events. the possibility that combinatorial light regimes may help to optimize growth and control developmental transitions makes the implementation of led technology particularly attractive to the design of controlled environments targeted to plant production for aesthetic applications, or applications relevant to human nutrition. if spectral quality alone can delay or hasten the floral transition it may have profound effects on modulating the delivery of nursery goods or perhaps affect the availability of consumable produce in a finite, controlled environment. this attribute alone makes led lighting a compelling platform for specific plant growth routines, such as those proposed for long-term inhabitation of space. since humans rely specifically on vegetative parts or reproductive parts of plants for nutrition, it is critical to develop systems which impart control of the progression of plant development to affect plant output toward the particular needs of humans. the implementation of narrow-wavelength led technology may benefit plant growth schema through supplementation or complete retrofitting of existing chambers. its compact design may replace existing infrastructure with long-life and consistent output. here, antiquated lamp systems, replete with toxic, inefficient fluors, may be refitted with efficient light sources that require little to no maintenance with comparable light output. although previously unattainable without substantial engineering, the geometry of the systems provided in this report brings led technology to the average plant biology laboratory. despite their vast advantages over conventional lighting systems, the led arrays described in this report offer opportunities for improvement and expansion. larger installations require close attention to array density, as the fluence rate of rgb hex led lights decays significantly toward the edges of the irradiation area. careful arrangement modified to the application lessens the frequency of ""hotspots"" or other gradients of light intensities under the light fixture. it is impossible to eliminate all variability under the arrays under all fluence rates and light combinations. the spacing of hex units in individual systems needs to be carefully tailored for the specific application. another potential improvement would be to integrate par sensors into the system to provide irradiance feedback and adjust light intensity through a computer-aided regulatory circuit. this would allow the user to enter a specific irradiance value for the desired wavelength and would compensate for changes in led output that occur over time and with temperature changes in the ambient environment. this system has been developed using leds emitting three principal wavebands. the clear extrapolation is to add additional led types to generate additional spectrum coverage. leds currently manufactured include uv, far-red and infra-red light. from the plans presented within this report it may be possible to develop lighting systems that roughly approximate solar output by compounding the effects of multiple leds. such a system may prove especially valuable in optimizing plant physiology and may have applications to human physiology as well. the arrays described were tested for support of normal plant developmental responses. these are most conspicuous in early seedling development, as initial responses to light are rapid, robust, and have been well characterized. three responses to light, namely inhibition of stem elongation, stem growth promotion and phototropism, have been extremely well characterized and may be used to test and verify the utility of these led arrays on early plant developmental responses. three assays were conducted. first, end-point stem growth was measured in plants grown under three fluence rates of red or blue light. red and blue light strongly inhibit early stem elongation through the phytochrome and cryptochrome systems, respectively. the results of two independent fluence-rate/response experiments using over seedlings are shown in figure 5a and 5b. figure 5a shows the height of seedlings grown for h under constant blue light and figure 5b shows the effect of the same treatment with red light. the cry and phyb mutants are presented as controls. the data show that constant blue or red light inhibit seedling elongation in a manner roughly proportional to fluence rate. inhibition is detectable even at low fluence rate, leading to a strong inhibition of stem growth elongation. the results of these trials mirror the previously published results, suggesting that the led arrays described herein act in a manner similar to those used previously. while phytochromes and cryptochrome effects are salient as stem growth inhibition after days of growth in constant light, other rapid responses involve other light sensors and can be measured on the order of minutes rather than days. contrary to the effects of red and blue, a short single pulse of green light stimulates rapid elongation of the hypocotyl in the dark-grown seedling. the response persists in all photomorphogenic mutants, it occurs when plants are grown in constant dim red light, and growth promotion is the opposite of what occurs when seedlings are irradiated with red or blue light. this evidence renders it difficult to conveniently ascribe this response to any of the known light sensors, and it is likely being mediated by a separate green-sensitive transduction pathway. figure 5c, shows the results of independent seedlings treated with green light from the norlux hex arrays, compared to previously published data. seedlings irradiated with a short, single pulse of green light begin to grow rapidly within min, attaining 140% of their dark rate before growth rate declines to dark levels after an hour. the results are highly similar to published findings, again indicating that norlux hex arrays are a suitable alternative to other led or fluorescent light sources. phototropism is the rapid curvature of the hypocotyl toward a unilateral light source. in arabidopsis phototropism is blue light induced and is mediated by the phototropins, autophosphorylating serine-threonine kinases associated with the plasma membrane. the response is exquisitely sensitive to blue light. here wild-type seedlings were irradiated from the side while being imaged in 5-minute intervals with an infra-red ccd camera. the degree of curvature was monitored over two hours and compared to previous results. the results indicate that the rapid response of phototropism is very similar between the arrays designed in this study and those produced commercially.  as the availability of new technologies increases, research programs are challenged with the need to retool their capabilities to exploit their potential. since many of these new technologies are electronic and/or computer related, a certain degree of technical prowess is required to move ideas from the drawing board to application. the development costs of these technologies may be significant. this report offers two clearly applicable models of led light source development that may be implemented in the study of plant growth and output, helping to narrow the long-term challenges of illumination to support plant growth. these designs allow the fine control of specific wavebands shown to influence plant growth and development. such designs represent the first step in defining conditions that will optimize, or perhaps even control, plant growth and development. the light sources used in this report sustain normal plant early developmental responses, suggesting that they are an appropriate substitute for, or complement to, other plant illumination solutions. "," although specific light attributes, such as color and fluence rate, influence plant growth and development, researchers generally cannot control the fine spectral conditions of artificial plant-growth environments. plant growth chambers are typically outfitted with fluorescent and/or incandescent fixtures that provide a general spectrum that is accommodating to the human eye and not necessarily supportive to plant development. many studies over the last several decades, primarily in arabidopsis thaliana, have clearly shown that variation in light quantity, quality and photoperiod can be manipulated to affect growth and control developmental transitions. light emitting diodes has been used for decades to test plant responses to narrow-bandwidth light. leds are particularly well suited for plant growth chambers, as they have an extraordinary life, require little maintenance, and use negligible energy. these factors render led-based light strategies particularly appropriate for space-biology as well as terrestrial applications. however, there is a need for a versatile and inexpensive led array platform where individual wavebands can be specifically tuned to produce a series of light combinations consisting of various quantities and qualities of individual wavelengths. two plans are presented in this report.  in this technical report we describe the practical construction of tunable red-green-blue led arrays to support research in plant growth and development. two light fixture designs and corresponding circuitry are presented. the first is well suited for a laboratory environment for use in a finite area with small plants, such as arabidopsis. the second is expandable and appropriate for growth chambers. the application of these arrays to early plant developmental studies has been validated with assays of hypocotyl growth inhibition/promotion and phototropic curvature in arabidopsis seedlings.  the presentation of these proven plans for led array construction allows the teacher, researcher or electronics aficionado a means to inexpensively build efficient, adjustable lighting modules for plant research. these simple and effective designs permit the construction of useful tools by programs short on electronics expertise. these arrays represent a means to modulate precise quality and quantity in experimental settings to test the effect of specific light combinations in regulating plant growth, development and plant-product yield.

3," peptidases are proteolytic enzymes essential for the life of all organisms. the relevance of peptidases is proved by the fact that 2–5% of all genes encode for peptidases and/or their homologs irrespectively of the organism source. in the swissprot database about 18% of sequences are annotated as ""undergoing proteolytic processing"", and there are over known and putative peptidases in the human genome. it is also worth noticing that more than 10% of the human peptidases are under investigation as drug targets. proteases are responsible for a number of fundamental cellular activities, such as protein turnover and defense against pathogenic organisms. since the basic protease function is ""protein digestion"", these proteins would be potentially dangerous in living organisms, if not fully controlled. this is one of the major reasons for the presence of their natural inhibitors inside the cell. all peptidases catalyze the same reaction, namely the hydrolysis of a peptide bond, but they are selective for the position of the substrate and also for the amino acid residues close to the bond that undergoes hydrolysis. there are different classes of peptidases identified by the catalytic group involved in the hydrolysis of the peptide bond. however the majority of the peptidases can be assigned to one of the following four functional classes: • serine peptidase • aspartic peptidase • cysteine peptidase • metallopeptidase in the serine and cysteine types the catalytic nucleophile can be the reactive group of the amino acid side chain, a hydroxyl group or a sulfhydryl group. in aspartic and metallopeptidases the nucleophile is commonly ""an activated water molecule"". in aspartic peptidases the side chains of aspartic residues directly bind the water molecule. in metallopeptidases one or two metal ions hold the water molecule in place and charged amino acid side chains are ligands for the metal ions. the metal may be zinc, cobalt or manganese, and a single metal ion is usually bound by three amino acid ligands. among the different ways to control their activity, the most important is through the interactions of the protein with other proteins, namely naturally occurring peptidase inhibitors. peptidase inhibitors can or cannot be specific for a certain group of catalytic reactions. in general there are two kinds of interactions between peptidases and their inhibitors: the first one is an irreversible process of ""trapping"", leading to a stable peptidase-inhibitor complex; the second one is a reversible process in which there is a tight binding reaction without any chemical bond formation. a shift of interest towards the mode of interaction of protein inhibitors with their targets is due to the possibility of designing new synthetic inhibitors. the research is driven by the many potential applications in medicine, agriculture and biotechnology. in the last years, an invaluable source of information about proteases and their inhibitors has been made available through the merops database, so that it is possible to search for known peptidase sequences or peptidase-inhibitor sequences. exploiting this source, in this paper we address the problem of relating a peptidase sequence with sequences that can putatively but reliably inhibit it. to this aim we implemented a method that first and reliably discriminates whether a given sequence is a peptidase or a peptidase-inhibitor, and afterwards gives a list of its putative interacting ligands. our method provides answers to the following questions: 1) given a pair of sequences, are they a pair of protease and inhibitor that can interact? 2) given a protease, can we predict the list of the proteins in a defined database that can inhibit the query protein? 3) given a proteome, can we compute the list of peptidases and their relative inhibitors for each protease class?  testing prosite and hmmer-pfam capability of detecting merops peptidases and inhibitors the first step of our analysis is to evaluate the performance of prosite on data sets of proteases and inhibitors, as derived from merops. our method focuses on the four major classes of peptidases and their inhibitors as identified by the catalytic group involved in the hydrolysis of the peptide bond: serine, aspartic, cysteine and metallo- peptidases. in merops there are annotations for peptidase patterns and inhibitor patterns. we adopted peptidases and inhibitors as annotated in merops as the positive class. the negative counterpart was taken from papia, and comprises non-inhibitor and non-peptidase non homologue sequences. we start by running prosite on the papia+merops data sets. prosite can or cannot find a correct match. if a known inhibitor sequence is matched by a prosite inhibitor pattern we count it as a true positive, otherwise it is labeled as a false negative. conversely, papia sequences having a match with a prosite inhibitor pattern are false positives; otherwise they are true negatives. in table the results obtained by filtering the prosite and the papia+merops data sets are listed. it is worth noticing that the prosite pattern search produces almost zero false positives on the merops+papia data set, although with a significant number of false negatives. this indicates that the method has a quite high specificity, but low coverage. in other words, a match has a high likelihood to be a true positive; however due to the low coverage, still a non-match label may indicate a false negative. in table we report the same type of analysis using hmmer-pfam. from the results it is evident that on average this method outperforms prosite. our finding is in agreement with early observations indicating that pfam is a better detection method than prosite. we find that pfam is more balanced than prosite, although with a slightly lower specificity. the decision-tree method the high level of prosite specificity prompted us to combine this pattern matching procedure with hmmer-pfam by adopting a decision-tree method in order to take advantage of the features of both approaches. the results of the combined approach are then listed in table it appears that the overall performance is slightly improved over hmmer-pfam alone. this is so particularly when the coverage of the positive class is considered. detection of possible protease-inhibitor interacting pairs the most relevant issue addressed by this paper is the measure of the detection accuracy of possible peptidase-inhibitor interacting pairs. the idea is to address questions related to the putative peptidase/inhibitor interaction. in order to test the combined accuracy of our decision-tree with respect to the prosite and hmmer-pfam methods, we have taken all the possible sequence combinations of our selected data set, namely peptidase/inhibitor, peptidase/papia, inhibitor/papia, peptidase/peptidase, inhibitor/inhibitor, papia/papia, excluding the self-combinations. by adopting this procedure we ended up with, pairs that were scored as described below. we divided merops peptidase sequences in four classes according to their biological activity: aspartic, cysteine, metallo and serine peptidases. we labeled the inhibitors in the same way, with the exception that one more class is present for them, labeled as u; this set clusters all the inhibitors that are able to inhibit to some extent all types of peptidases. among the, possible pairs only those pairs pertaining to proteases and inhibitors of the same class are counted as members of the positive class. all the remaining pairs are labeled as negative examples. on this data set we tested prosite, hmmer-pfam and the combined decision-tree. we also tested the reverse decision-tree in which hmmer and prosite are swapped. in table it is shown that despite of the fact that the overall accuracy is very high for all methods, the decision-tree outperforms all the others as the increased values of all scoring indexes indicate. actually, the decision-tree approach shows the highest coverage and accuracy for both the peptidase-inhibitor interacting class and the negative set. it is also worth noticing that the correlation coefficient, that indicates the displacement from the random prediction, is very high for the decision-tree and it outperforms the second best method of percentage points, with a false positive rate close to. this finding indicates that the decision-tree method can successfully be adopted to predict pairs of interacting peptidase/inhibitor, in order to sort out the subsets of possible interacting pairs of interest. annotating peptidases and their inhibitors in human and mouse genomes we applied the decision-tree method scored above to perform a large-scale genome annotation of peptidases and corresponding inhibitors of the human and mouse proteomes. we retrieved all known coding sequences and novel peptides from ensembl. the human proteome consists of sequences; the mouse proteome contains sequences. the decision- tree method is compared with prosite and hmmer-pfam in singling out peptidases and inhibitors. the predictive performance of the decision-tree method in predicting putative pairs of peptidase/inhibitor for each major class of both proteomes is reported in table our results corroborate the view that among peptidases, the aspartic class is less populated than the other three and this is so in both proteomes. for inhibitors, the less populated classes are aspartic, cysteine and universal. web server in order to facilitate the user's search for protease/inhibitor interactions, we implemented a very simple web interface that exploits our developed decision-tree system. in practice it is possible to paste a sequence and the system checks whether that sequence is a protease or an inhibitor candidate. if the decision-tree returns a positive answer the server will provide the putative class among the four and the list of all possible known inhibitors. furthermore, the web server furnishes also the corresponding lists of possible ensembl protease-codes of the human and mouse proteomes that belong to the predicted class of proteins and that can interact with the query sequence. the server is available at.  in this paper we developed a decision-tree based method that exploits the features of prosite and hmmer-pfam in annotating peptidases and inhibitors and that is capable of correctly and reliably predict whether a given peptidase can or cannot interact with an inhibitor. the decision-tree discriminates peptidases or inhibitors with a score as high as 96% of correct predictions, improving both the coverage and the specificity of the positive class over prosite and hmmer-pfam. furthermore the decision-tree method is capable of predicting if a given protein pair is a pair of protease and inhibitor that can interact. this task can help in sorting out and speeding up the selection of possible interacting partners. given a protease or an inhibitor the decision-tree method computes the list of the proteins in a defined database that can inhibit or that can be inhibited by the query protein. finally, given a proteome the system provides the lists of peptidases and their relative inhibitors for each discriminated class. "," peptidases are proteolytic enzymes responsible for fundamental cellular activities in all organisms. apparently about 2–5% of the genes encode for peptidases, irrespectively of the organism source. the basic peptidase function is ""protein digestion"" and this can be potentially dangerous in living organisms when it is not strictly controlled by specific inhibitors. in genome annotation a basic question is to predict gene function. here we describe a computational approach that can filter peptidases and their inhibitors out of a given proteome. furthermore and as an added value to merops, a specific database for peptidases already available in the public domain, our method can predict whether a pair of peptidase/inhibitor can interact, eventually listing all possible predicted ligands.  we show that by adopting a decision-tree approach the accuracy of prosite and hmmer in detecting separately the four major peptidase types and their inhibitors among a non redundant set of globular proteins can be improved by some percentage points with respect to that obtained with each method separately. more importantly, our method can then predict pairs of peptidases and interacting inhibitors, scoring a joint global accuracy of 99% with coverage for the positive cases close to 100% and a correlation coefficient of %. in this task the decision-tree approach outperforms the single methods.  the decision-tree can reliably classify protein sequences as peptidases or inhibitors, belonging to a certain class, and can provide a comprehensive list of possible interacting pairs of peptidase/inhibitor. this information can help the design of experiments to detect interacting peptidase/inhibitor complexes and can speed up the selection of possible interacting candidates, without searching for them separately and manually combining the obtained results. a web server specifically developed for annotating peptidases and their inhibitors is available at 28– april italian society of bioinformatics: annual meeting bologna, italy ",8a0cd950-ad21-4665-a6ff-1336bbb4094a,pubmed
4," sodium dodecyl sulfate is a highly effective and widely used protein denaturant. our previous work has shown that amphipathic solvents, like 2-methyl- -pentanediol, a commonly used precipitant for crystallization studies, can protect proteins from sds denaturation, and in several cases can drive the transition from the sds-denatured state to a functional folded state. this protecting effect of mpd is observed with a wide range of proteins including membrane proteins and soluble enzymes, and is not applicable if proteins are denatured in guanidine or urea, two other denaturant agents. in the case of hen egg-white lysozyme, sds concentrations above mm abolished the activity of the enzyme in the absence of mpd. however, in m mpd, the activity was preserved in the presence of sds. in addition, when the enzyme was first denatured with sds for hours prior to adding mpd, full enzymatic activity was recovered in m mpd following a further hour incubation period. although the persistence of the enzyme activity in the sds/mpd mixture was clearly established, preservation of its structure was only speculative until now. in the present contribution, a detailed x-ray study addresses the pending question. crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme could be grown for the first time in a sds/mpd medium, providing support that adding mpd to proteins can avoid sds denaturation. the obtained complexes of sds-lysozyme and mpd-lysozyme give some insights in the interplay of protein-sds and protein-mpd interactions. a previous report described the structure of cross-linked lysozyme crystals soaked in sds solutions. in the latter, unlike both structures described in this paper, sds was found at three different locations inside the protein inducing a major structural deformation in the interior of lysozyme.  crystallization crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme solubilized in mm sds, a usually denaturing condition, and m mpd were obtained, without any cross-linking, contrary to the study of yonath et al., in two different conditions. tetragonal crystals, called ""form i"" crystals, were obtained from a classical sodium acetate solution at ph. in this condition, few mpd, slightly volatile, is expected to remain in the drop after equilibration of the protein droplet with the mpd-free reservoir solution. to enhance the concentration of sds and mpd into the drop, and taking into account results from the literature, crystals were also obtained by equilibrating protein solutions with reservoir solutions of mm tris ph 70% mpd and mm sds resulting in ""form ii"" crystals. both crystals belong to the same tetragonal space group, p form i crystals diffracted x-rays to and form ii diffracted to Å. ramachandran plot values listed in parentheses are for the highest resolution. a rfactor = ∑||fo| - |fc||/∑|fo|. rfree was calculated with 5% of the reflections set aside randomly throughout the refinement. structure overview unlike the one obtained by yonath et al, the overall conformation of both structures is very similar to native lysozyme. the rmsd values calculated using the cα atoms, after superimposition with the native structure, are and Å for form i and form ii crystals, respectively. no large structural changes are observed and the interior of the enzyme is intact. the most significant variations are observed at the surface of the proteins in loops where electron densities are less well-defined. these differences are probably due to uncertainties from the model or intrinsic thermal behavior. the presence of high concentration of mpd can therefore avoid disruption of the structure of the enzyme by sds. indeed, as shown by yonath, sds, by binding deeply into the hydrophobic core of the protein, induces separation of the two wings of lysozyme. in addition, the form i crystal, where few mpd is expected to remain in the drop, shows that mpd was able to induce irreversibly the correct folding of lysozyme in the presence of a denaturing concentration of sds. interaction of sds or mpd with lysozyme depending on the used reservoir solution, different small molecules were found co-crystallized with lysozyme. sds and mpd molecules could be identified unambiguously in the density maps due to their characteristic shape. with condition ii buffer, a first mpd molecule, in the s configuration, occupies the c-subsite in the sugar-binding cleft of the protein formed by residues asn trp ile ala and trp. this was also found to be the binding site of alcohol molecules like ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol and of denaturants, used at non-denaturing concentrations, like dmso, guanidinium hydrochloride and urea. this is in agreement with the assumption that generally mpd molecules prefer to bind to hydrophobic site and mpd binding is penetrative, leading to displacement of water molecules in grooves and cavities. the hydrophobic part of the molecule interacts with trp and both alcohol groups are h bonded to the backbone of asn and to trp respectively. a second mpd molecule, in the s configuration, is bound on the surface between two lysozyme molecules, close to arg. no molecules of sds were observed in the electronic density map. the s configuration of both mpd molecules is quite clear by lowering the contour level to around but at this stage, it is impossible to deduce that s-mpd is more stabilizing than the r one. a comparison of the above structure with the one of lysozyme crystallized in the presence of mpd, without sds, yields rmsd of Ǻ for the superposition of cα atoms. the location of the second mpd molecule in the present study matches the one previously described, except the configuration which is switched. the water molecule between mpd and arg is also conserved. moreover, two chloride ions were identified in the same binding site as in the 1dpw structure. additionally, a sodium ion was observed ligated to the main chain carbonyl oxygen's of residues ser cys arg oγ of ser side chain, and two water molecules. this sodium ion binding site was present in the enzyme in the presence of low concentration of dmso and guanidinium chloride. with the condition i buffer, as expected, no electron density was observed for mpd whereas a sds molecule was found on the surface of lysozyme, exposed to the solvent. as suggested by weiss et al, mpd may only be able to bind lysozyme at high ph values and/or at high concentration. sds is loosely bound, as indicated by its temperature factors. the sds sulphate is salt bridged to arg and the hydrocarbon tail makes contacts with ser cys64-pro ser72-asn the binding position is different from those described in the sds-lysozyme complex described earlier where the sds molecules bind deeply into the protein. indeed, the hydrophobic interactions of sds with the core of the protein are assumed to be lowered in the presence of mpd. in addition, the binding of sds does not alter the structure of lysozyme. in this structure, no sodium or chloride ions were observed. it is worth noting that this study presents one of the very few structures of proteins co-crystallized with a denaturing concentration of sds in its native form.  this study, where crystals of lysozyme were grown for the first time in the presence of the amphipathic solvent mpd and denaturing concentrations of sds, clearly established the preservation of the enzyme structure in a sds/mpd mixture. it is hypothesized that high concentrations of mpd, changing the properties of sds, would lower or avoid interactions between sds and the protein. indeed, in the form ii crystal, even though it contains higher sds concentration, but also higher mpd concentration, than in the form i, no sds molecule was observed. this assumption is in agreement with the size-exclusion chromatography study described earlier, demonstrating that the protein no longer interacts strongly with sds in a mpd buffer system. these structural data therefore support the hypothesis that mpd can protect proteins from sds denaturation. in addition, it is worth noting that this contribution shows one of the very few structures of proteins, in its native form, co-crystallized with sds. "," recently, we reported a unique approach to preserve the activity of some proteins in the presence of the denaturing agent, sodium dodecyl sulfate. this was made possible by addition of the amphipathic solvent -methyl-2-pentanediol, used as protecting but also as refolding agent for these proteins. although the persistence of the protein activity in the sds/mpd mixture was clearly established, preservation of their structure was only speculative until now.  in this paper, a detailed x-ray study addresses the pending question. crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme were grown for the first time in the presence of mpd and denaturing concentrations of sds. depending on crystallization conditions, tetragonal crystals in complex with either sds or mpd were collected. the conformation of both structures was very similar to the native lysozyme and the obtained complexes of sds-lysozyme and mpd-lysozyme give some insights in the interplay of protein-sds and protein-mpd interactions.  this study clearly established the preservation of the enzyme structure in a sds/mpd mixture. it is hypothesized that high concentrations of mpd would change the properties of sds and lower or avoid interactions between the denaturant and the protein. these structural data therefore support the hypothesis that mpd avoids disruption of the enzyme structure by sds and can protect proteins from sds denaturation.

5," regulatory variants that alter gene expression can be examined, based on allelic imbalance, i.e., alleles can be differently expressed in an individual if the regulatory region around a gene differs. in rna sequencing data, it is possible to determine the allele from which a specific read originates when there is at least one heterozygous snp in the sequence read. an ai event indicates that there is a variant that changes gene expression within or near that gene. it only takes one individual, assuming that there is a heterozygous site in the gene of interest. the detection of an ai event is not trivial, comprising several steps, including library preparation, sequencing, mapping, and analysis of somatic mutations and rna-editing, which can bias the allele count. to counter such biases when determining the true ai for an exon or gene, a smaller region must be visualized to discover inconsistent patterns. the allelicimbalance package was developed to address these issues, allowing the user to test ai at a single gene or snp quickly. nevertheless, the package is suitable for performing any custom global ai analysis, because there is always a counting step and the need to store counts in a smart container, which facilitates access to custom requests from the user. for genes that have more than one heterozygous snp and at least one sample, there is a function to visualize ai consistency easily over the gene as an internal validation to select snps that are suitable for further ai qtl study. the package is easy to use, comprising an infrastructure that is linked to the bioconductor environment, and allows the user to pose genetic questions quickly.fig. short title: ai consistency using glocationplot. detailed legend: on top are the fractions of alleles over apob for snps with a maf > . each bar represents one of eight samples, and the grey lines in the middle show the snp locations in apob beneath in yellow. all snps shown are close around the black line, denoting 1: expression of the alleles. see additional file for the total allele count for each snp allelicimbalance was developed to provide usability for inexperienced as experienced r-users. for inexperienced users, there is a standard protocol to create an aseset from bam files, and functions, such as barplot, can be used directly on that aseset class object; experienced users can customize nearly any part of the workflow. the design is based on rna-sequencing, but allelicimbalance can be used with any allele that is focused on a count-based technique, such as digital qpcr. implementation management aseset is a new object class that summarizes sequencing data. it contains allele counts, phenotypes, and snp positions and inherits the summarizedexperiments class and all functions that can be applied to that class, such as subset and range operation. the class has support for strand- and nonstrand-specific data. the first step in ai analysis is to create an aseset from mapped data in bam file format and a set of snps of interest. the support functions will summarize the allele counts for each snp rapidly and save them in an aseset object.fig. short title: flowchart of a typical workflow in the allelicimbalance package fig. short title: a few simple commands are needed to construct an aseset-class object. detailed legend: if the bam files are unprocessed before being imported into r, we recommend elaborating the filtering on the mapping with regard to quality and perfect mate-pairs before counting the alleles detection equal amounts of reads are expected from two alleles, but one allele might be read more than the other by chance. a greater number of reads improves the estimate of the total distribution. statistical tests, such as the chi-square and binomial tests, generate the probability that an observed difference is due to this sampling bias. these relatively simple and general tests can be applied directly to aseset objects and return a matrix with p-values for each snp and sample. the user can easily apply other custom tests by taking advantage of the aseset accessor methods to retrieve allele fractions or counts, for example. visualization and annotation allelicimbalance has good visualization capabilities and provides a rich description of allele-specific expression in a region. the barplot function has options to display the data as a fraction or count plot and can be used with the bioconductor annotationdbi and genomicfeatures packages to show the annotation of a gene, an exon, and transcript information.fig. short title: the dual-strand barplot. detailed legend: the barplot from the allelicimbalance package shows the number of reads aligning to each allele and strand for one snp. upward bars indicate the strand, and downward bars indicate the strand. the numbers under the bars are the p-values from testing whether a difference in allele expression is due to chance. because the data are strand-specific, nearly all reads over this snp are mapped to one strand, consistent with the location of the investigated genes. all samples in this figure are from liver. a of the heterozygote individuals 5– and show no ai, whereas individual shows significant ai. but, the plot also shows expression off of the opposite strand, which might comprise antisense transcripts. b individuals and show ai. c individuals and show strong ai. d individuals and show ai, whereas subjects and show no ai. see additional file and for barplots using different aligners the bioconductor package gviz uses tracks and trellis graphics to imitate genome browsers’ visualization of a genomic region. to integrate allelicimbalance data as a track, it takes merely a function call over an aseset object to create an object that is directly applicable for use with gviz. the most common applications of these tracks have been wrapped in a function, called glocationplot. the glocationplot function displays several barplots in the same graph and marks their location in a region.fig. short title: ai consistency for different alignment methods for fn detailed legend: a comparison of fractions over snps between a star, b star with n-replaced snp reference genome, and c tophat in the normal star and tophat run, the fraction lies around 1: for most snps, except snp, which shows strong ai. in c, however, the fractions are approximately 1: for all snps. d this graph summarizes the total counts for each snp over all samples for the alignment methods. see additional file for the total allele count for each snp mapping bias an rna sequencing read that contains snps can lead to a mapping bias—eg, reads that are more similar to the reference will map more often. this bias must be measured in the alignment step, such as through the generation of artificial reads that are equally distributed for both alleles over each snp of interest. in the alignment of reads, it is also possible to allow for more mismatches to decrease the bias toward the reference allele, but this step could affect the accuracy of the mapping. alignment to personal phased genomes is another method to handle mapping bias, requiring dna sequencing of the same individuals or ultimately personal transcriptomes, necessitating longer rna sequencing reads. to this end, allelicimbalance has a function that defines the expected allele ratios other than 1: to adjust for this mapping bias when searching for ai. the package also has a function that creates a reference genome in which known snps are masked by the generic nucleotide n, which can then be used in a realignment. in this article, we reduced the mapping bias effect using this method and masked all known variants in dbsnp build prior to alignment.  allelicimbalance can detect ai from rna sequencing data that originate from transcriptional material. with sufficient read depth over a gene, it is even possible to detect and quantify the alleles in introns of the precursor mrna. for example, we analyzed unpublished, strand-specific rna sequencing data from the livers of individuals and the aortas of subjects. to exemplify how ai can be used in a simple qtl analysis, four genes with high coverage—fgb, c kng, and itih4—were plotted as dual barplots. the plots show the binomial test p-values and provide visual confirmation of the presence of ai events. in this example, allelicimbalance demonstrates that there are cis effects for several individuals in all of these genes. using established methods, such as eqtl, it would not have been possible to detect this effect in a limited sample size. in all of the exemplified genes, most reads came from one strand, suggesting that the interference of lncrnas, for example, is low. but, at least 40 % of human genes are transcribed in both directions, potentially affecting the measurements of ai for a gene if there is ai on its antisense transcript. to compare loci or individuals in which the read depth differs, it can be convenient to plot alleles as a fraction and inspect a wider region of all heterozygous snps, for example, of the same gene. without interference from allele-specific splicing, we expect all snps over a gene to show the same pattern of fractions. figure  shows an example for which there is consistency between heterozygous snps in a gene; there is no ai, but the overall 1: expression supports that the ai measurements are consistent in the rna-seq data. to illustrate the reduction in mapping bias, we replaced the snps in the reference genome with the generic nucleotide indicator n. all snps in dbsnp build were masked in this manner, and we then reperformed the alignment with star. figure  shows an example of how such steps can improve the detection of true ai compared with a default run using star or tophat.  the allelicimbalance package will be valuable in examining the genetics of rna sequencing experiments. this software is a novel tool in the bioconductor environment, in which no infrastructure that can perform ai analyses exists. the import functions are essential when retrieving allele counts for specific nucleotide positions from all rna-seq reads. similarly, the statistical analysis and plotting functions are necessary to identify any allele-specific expression patterns in one’s data. with merely a limited amount of samples, strong genetic effects on gene expression can be discovered. availability and requirements gpl3-licensed and available in the bioconductor framework.project name: allelicimbalance software

allelic imbalance of the expression of a gene. this process is often a complex task that entails quality control, alignment, and the counting of reads over heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. allelic imbalance analysis is subject to technical biases, due to differences in the sequences of the measured alleles. flexible bioinformatics tools are needed to ease the workflow while retaining as much rna sequencing information as possible throughout the analysis to detect and address the possible biases.  we present allelicimblance, a software program that is designed to detect, manage, and visualize allelic imbalances comprehensively. the purpose of this software is to allow users to pose genetic questions in any rna sequencing experiment quickly, enhancing the general utility of rna sequencing. the visualization features can reveal notable, non-trivial allelic imbalance behavior over specific regions, such as exons.  the software provides a complete framework to perform allelic imbalance analyses of aligned rna sequencing data, from detection to visualization, within the robust and versatile management class, aseset. electronic supplementary

6," human embryonic stem cells, derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst stage embryo, are able to differentiate into all cell types of the adult body and have the potential for unlimited growth. as a consequence of their pluripotency and self-renewal capacity, hes cells are ideal for investigating the basic mechanisms of development and cell differentiation. in addition, they may be a source of differentiated cells of a particular cell type, to be used in toxicity screening, cell replacement therapies and many other applications. pluripotent cells are characterized by several features, such as the expression of pluripotency factors, nanog and sox ), the presence of specific cell surface antigens, and distinct chromatin signatures. to date, the molecular basic mechanisms of hes cell differentiation and development are largely unknown. differentiation can be induced in vitro under specific culture conditions, such as the addition of retinoic acid, a morphogen commonly used for multilineage differentiation of es cells in general and for specific development along the neural lineage. amongst other techniques, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction is very well suited for monitoring pluripotency and differentiation, as it allows accurate messenger rna quantification of numerous samples at the same time. in the context of hes cell characterization, rt-qpcr is applied for evaluating the expression of the transcription factors oct and nanog, since the expression of these core pluripotency circuitry members decreases significantly within a few days after onset of differentiation. for proper rt-qpcr data evaluation, several variables need to be taken into account. these include sample handling and storage, starting material quantity and quality, efficiency of different enzymatic reaction steps and overall transcriptional activity differences between cells. to correct for these variables, different normalization methods have been reported. gene expression levels can be standardized to cell number, however, it is not always possible to obtain an accurate enumeration of cells. in addition, this strategy does not consider possible insufficient enzymatic reaction efficiencies. alternatively, data are normalized for rna mass quantity, although this is not always representative for the mrna content. ribosomal rna molecules make up the major part of the total rna mass and may be regulated, thus resulting in a variable rrna/mrna ratio. the most frequently utilized strategy is the inclusion of one or preferably more reference genes as an internal standard. the expression of these references should ideally not vary between cells of interest or as a consequence of experimental handling. selecting stable reference genes is critical for correct interpretation of rt-qpcr data. however, when studying differentiating hes cells, proper reference gene selection is not straightforward. differentiation does not only include various morphological changes, but also major alterations in gene expression levels of numerous genes. the regulation of some reference genes may be associated with these cellular changes, hence the stability of the used references has to be evaluated. the available differentiation protocols may induce distinct gene expression variability, which impedes finding stably expressed reference genes over the different samples and making protocol-dependent optimization required. in this study, we emphasize the importance of determining suitable reference genes by performing an expression stability analysis for retinoic acid induced differentiating hes cells, using the genormplus algorithm in the qbaseplus software. the possibility of co-regulation was reduced by opting for candidate reference genes from different functional categories. in addition to these candidates, a new normalization strategy was applied, based on the measurement of expressed alu repeats. alu insertions are repetitive dna sequences, approximately base pairs long and occurring generally at high copy number in introns, 3′ untranslated regions of genes and intergenic genomic regions. these short interspersed mobile elements are not equally spread throughout the human genome, since they preferentially accumulate in gene-rich regions. in total, alu elements comprise more than 10% of the genome mass, thus being the most abundant of all mobile elements and they are divided in several well-conserved subfamilies. alu repeats, named after a recognition site for the restriction enzyme alu i, are thought to be amplified by retrotransposition, a process in which the alu element is transcribed by rna polymerase iii, followed by reverse transcription and incorporation into the genome. because of their genome-wide distribution, including in the 3′ utr of protein coding genes, individual gene expression variability in the cells of interest will not substantially influence total alu element expression. this feature makes the alu repeats a valuable and interesting strategy for rt-qpcr normalization for biological systems such as differentiating stem cells.  human es cells were induced to differentiate for several days by addition of retinoic acid to the culture medium. the fading undifferentiated state of hes cells was assessed morphologically, using light microscopy. differentiation was initially visible at the colony periphery where cells start to pile-up, and in comparison to undifferentiated cells, differentiating colonies lost their round shape with well-defined borders, as illustrated in figure  to confirm differentiation, the expression levels of pluripotency genes pou5f and nanog can be followed over time using rt-qpcr. for this purpose, the most stable normalization references were determined by means of a stability analysis using the genormplus application in qbaseplus. the stability of candidate references was analyzed for a first series of samples, which were isolated every 24 hours during 8 days of differentiation. in the stability ranking, β-2-microglobulin, ribosomal protein l13a and alu repeats were found to be the most stable reference loci for this experimental set-up. the stability measure of these three references varied from to, which indicates a high stability in comparison to the other candidates, as m values up to are considered acceptably stable for homogenous samples. in the determination of the optimal reference number, two appeared to be sufficient for rt-qpcr normalization, as the pairwise variation was approximately for upgrading from two to three reference loci. v values less than indicate that increasing the number of references would not add any more significant value to the assay. *exon-spanning primer pair; §forward and reverse primer localized in the same exon. reference stability was analyzed for three independent hes cell differentiation experiments, applying the genormplus algorithm. results are displayed with decreasing stability from top to bottom. as a confirmation for this first experiment, a reference stability analysis was performed during two more hes cell differentiation experiments. for experiment samples were collected every 24 hours during 6 days, and a third series was collected every 4 hours during day and after onset of differentiation. again, the same three reference loci were found to be the most stable in both experiments. the m values for b2m, rpl13a and alusq varied from to, and from to for experiment and respectively. also in both cases, two references were shown to be enough for normalization, considering the low v2/ values. subsequently, the expression data of pou5f and nanog were normalized applying two different reference sets: relative quantification using three commonly used genes versus the three most stable references determined in the analyses described above. as can be expected, this comparison revealed a substantial difference in the change of expression levels of pou5f and nanog, emphasizing the importance of proper reference gene selection. as illustrated for experiment in figure  the decrease in expression of these pluripotency factors is significantly less pronounced using the ‘traditional’ reference genes than with the most stable reference loci as defined in this study. also for the other two experiments a significant difference was seen. discussion human es cells provide a unique opportunity to study early development and may hold great potential for regenerative medicine. the transcription factors oct and nanog contribute to self-renewal and are required for maintaining the pluripotent state of hes cells. therefore, the expression of these factors is commonly assessed with rt-qpcr, as mrna levels decrease significantly within a few days after inducing differentiation. morphological evaluation of the differentiating cells shows that hes cells start to accumulate at the edges of the colonies and that individual cells adopt a more lengthened, neuronal-like phenotype during early hes cell differentiation. adequate rt-qpcr normalization is essential for valid data interpretation. however, in vitro hes cell differentiation entails massive gene expression alterations in general and specifically due to the differentiation agent itself, whereby the expression of individual reference genes may vary, thus making it difficult to select the most suitable and stable references. synnergren and colleagues already made note of a unique reference gene expression pattern when differentiating hes cells spontaneously. and as willems et al. also showed, normalization results vary significantly depending on the reference used. in this study, the suitability of different references was evaluated using the genormplus algorithm. from our results, it can be concluded that b2m, rpl13a and alu repeats are the most stable reference loci for this specific differentiation protocol. the use of two references was shown to be sufficient for accurate normalization of rt-qpcr data, though generally the use of three stable references is recommended in literature. the importance of selecting the most stable and suitable references is illustrated by normalization of gene expression levels of pluripotency factors oct and nanog. comparison of b2m, rpl13a and alusq with more ‘traditional’ reference genes, resulted in a significantly different normalization, indicating that classic reference genes such as gapdh are not always appropriate for a given set-up. in the field of stem cell differentiation, optimization is required for each specific differentiation protocol. despite the comparability of different algorithms for determining reference stability, their application may result in a slightly different stability order in comparison with the genormplus applet. this may indicate though that different reference sets are applicable, resulting in analogous normalization data. when applying those algorithms to the results of experiment alu repeats and rpl13a remain among the top stable reference loci. b2m deteriorates a few ranks when using normfinder and bestkeeper, and is replaced by tbp as a more stable reference. nevertheless, the comparison of normalization data for b2m, rpl13a & alusq and tbp, rpl13a & alusq, gave no significant difference. in conclusion, b2m, rpl13a and alusq are suitable reference loci for this experimental set-up of retinoic acid induced hes cell differentiation. β-2-microglobulin is a component of major histocompatibility complex i, hence being expressed in every nucleated cell, and has yet been applied before as a normalization scalar in different set-ups. ribosomal protein l13a is involved in the process of transcript translation, and has also been widely included as a reference gene for rt-qpcr analyses, in spite of possible presence of pseudogenes. however, pseudogene detection does not necessarily imply that a specific reference is not usable. the main point of interest is the reference stability, which in this case is clearly maintained as supported by the data described above. in our hands both b2m and rpl13a repeatedly do come forward as a stable reference, supporting their use as normalization genes. the fact that alu repeats were one of the best scoring reference loci in the described analyses is not surprising. because of their genome-wide distribution, they can be considered as a measure for the total amount of mrna, and the overall alu element expression will not be influenced by a variation in expression of individual genes. for this reference, primer specificity is of minor importance. the more sequences are detected by the assay, the less the impact of individual expression variations on the total alu content. hence, alu repeats provide a new strategy for reliable normalization of rt-qpcr data, in particular in experiments where dramatic changes are expected. an additional advantage when working with limited amounts of starting material, is that the input can be lowered, since alu repeats are highly expressed and thus lead to low cq values.  this study shows that some of the commonly used reference genes cannot always be included as a stable normalization scalar. selection of suitable references is highly dependent on the experimental set-up, as is illustrated here for early hes cell differentiation induced by retinoic acid. furthermore, a new normalization strategy based on alu repeat expression is proposed and validated for hes cell differentiation experiments. "," selecting stably expressed reference genes is essential for proper reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene expression analysis. however, this choice is not always straightforward. in the case of differentiating human embryonic stem cells, differentiation itself introduces changes whereby reference gene stability may be influenced.  in this study, we evaluated the stability of various references during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of hes cells. out of candidate references, beta-2-microglobulin, ribosomal protein l13a and alu repeats are found to be the most stable for this experimental set-up.  our results show that some of the commonly used reference genes are actually not amongst the most stable loci during hes cell differentiation promoted by retinoic acid. moreover, a novel normalization strategy based on expressed alu repeats is validated for use in hes cell experiments. reverse transcription quantitative pcrnormalizationreference genesalu repeatshuman embryonic stem cellsstem cell differentiation ",bd16ecf4-656d-4c53-84e2-b99023cfdf9c,pubmed
7," 2-phenylethanol, an aromatic alcohol with rose-like odour, is widely used in the food, drink and cosmetic industry, and it’s also a potentially valuable alcohol for next-generation biofuel. additionally, 2-pe is an important raw material for its derivatives, among which phenylethyl acetate is a valuable fragrance compound, and p-hydroxyphenylethanol is widely used in pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 2-pe can be synthesized by chemical and biological methods. up to now, the vast majority of 2-pe is produced chemically, while purification of the product is still a key problem in these chemical processes. the quality of the chemical synthesized 2-pe is reduced greatly because of its harsh conditions and the toxic reagents. 2-pe naturally exists in rose flower, and a number of fungi are known as 2-pe producers including phellinus ignarius, ischnoderma benzoinum, geotrichum penicillatum, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus niger etc. –. s. cerevisiae could produce  g l- 2-pe in fed-batch fermentation. when oleic acid was used as the organic phase for two-phase fed-batch cultures, s. cerevisiae could produce  g l- 2-pe. however, all these fermentations use phenylalanine as feedstock, the prices of which barred the industrial scale production of 2-pe. very few bacteria were found to synthesize 2-pe. when using aromatic amino acids as nitrogen source, erwinia carotovora was proved to produce 2-pe. jollivet et al. found 2-pe in the culture of microbacterium sp. and brevibacterium linens, while no further progress was reported. 2-pe can be biosynthesized from phenylalanine through the phenylethylamine pathway and the ehrlich pathway in eukaryotes, and the latter one is thought to be the most significant pathway. the shikimate pathway and the ehrlich pathway can form a phenylpyruvate pathway, which can de-novo synthesize 2-pe from glucose. hwang j-y et al. constructed the yeast ehrlich pathway into e. coli, but the failure of overexpressing all the foreign proteins in soluble and active form blocked the high production of 2-pe, and they also used phenylalanine as feedstock. james c. liao et al. engineered e. coli to produce varied alcohols by overexpressing different heterologous 2-keto-acid decarboxylases and alcohol dehydrogenases, and 2-pe was detected among these alcohols, but the substrate specificity of kdcs was broad and no further research was performed for 2-pe. whether increasing carbon flux to the 2-keto acids could improve the productivity of the alcohol or not is still needed to be verified. in our study, a new strain enterobacter sp. cgmcc was isolated and identified. the strain was verified to produce 2-pe using de-novo synthetic pathway with monosaccharide as a carbon source and nh4cl as a nitrogen source. two rate-limiting enzymes, phea and dahp synthase, were overexpressed to increase the flux to 2-keto phenylpyruvate to further increase production of 2-pe.  identification of the strain the bacterium was accidentally obtained when we screened strains against 5 g l- resorcinol, and 2-pe was detected when it was cultured in the selective medium. the screened strain is rod-shaped, with width from to  μm and length from to 2 μm. and it is an aerobic bacterium. 16s rdna gene sequence was blasted at ncbi against genome survey sequence. based on these results, this strain was identified to be e. sp. and preserved in china general microbiological culture collection center as e. sp. cgmcc 2-pe has been used as a bactericide in pharmaceutical preparations for many years. 2-pe was thought to induce the breakdown of the cell membrane limitedly and inhibit the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid. secretion of 2-pe by this bacteria may be a bactericidal substance for interspecies competition. many microorganisms, especially yeasts, have been reported to produce 2-pe by normal metabolism, however, the final concentration of 2-pe in the culture broth of selected strains remains very low. that was why all the fermentation for 2-pe used phenylalanine as nitrogen source. besides, very few wild prokaryotic organisms were reported to secrete 2-pe. therefore, validation of 2-pe de-novo biosynthesis pathway is not only useful metabolic engineering but also valuable for theoretical research. validating of 2-pe de-novo biosynthesis in e. sp. cgmcc 5087 as the selective medium contains beef and yeast extract, m medium was used to validate whether e. sp. cgmcc can biosynthesize 2-pe using glucose as the sole carbon source. after e. sp. cgmcc was grown in m medium at 37°c for 24 h, 2-pe was detected. characteristic ion spectra was shown in figure 2b. the production of 2-pe in m medium was much lower than in lb medium. the results indicated that e. sp. cgmcc can synthesize 2-pe using de-novo pathway with monosaccharide as carbon source and nh4cl as nitrogen source. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first wild bacterium validated to produce 2-pe using glucose as sole carbon source. although phenylalanine is mostly used as fermentation stock for 2-pe biosynthesis, the high price is still a huge disadvantage. the cheaper glucose makes this strain more competitive for industrial production. most microorganisms can synthesize phenylalanine via shikimate pathway, and subsequently phenylalanine can be converted to 2-pe by many microorganisms through phenylethylamine pathway or ehrlich pathway. the shikimate pathway and the ehrlich pathway are connected by the phenylpyruvate to form a phenylpyruvate pathway, which can de-novo synthesize 2-pe from glucose. validating the synthetic pathway of 2-pe would be helpful for the further research. validating phenylpyruvate pathway in e. sp. cgmcc 5087 we examined the activity of crude enzymes to identify 2-pe biosynthesis pathway involved in e. sp. cgmcc the results indicated that crude enzymes can catalyze phenylpyruvate to 2-pe. as phenylpyruvate is not the intermediate product of phenylethylamine pathway, the occurrence of 2-pe suggested that it is biotransformed from phenylpyruvate through ehrlich pathway, which is consistent with the pathway that james c. liao and hwang j-y constructed. meanwhile, the results indicate that 2-keto-acid decarboxylase is produced by e. sp. cgmcc kdcs have a broad substrate range and widely exist in plants, yeasts and fungi, but less so in bacteria. no other alcohols such as 1-butanol were detected indicates that the kdc has a good substrate specificity. in the ehrlich pathway, phenylpyruvate was converted to phenylacetaldehyde by kdc firstly, and then converted to 2-pe by alcohol dehydrogenase with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as reducing agent. as importing and expressing non-native pathways may lead to the metabolic imbalance, and also heterologous metabolites may exhibit cytotoxicity, co-existence of phenylpyruvate pathway and the two enzymes kdc and adh makes e. sp. cgmcc a good candidate to produce 2-pe. biosynthesis of 2-pe with engineered e. sp. cgmcc 5087 the existing shikimate pathway was then genetically modified to increase 2-pe production by enhancing the formation of phenylpyruvate. both chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase are proved to be rate-limiting enzymes in the l-phenylalanine synthesis pathway. therefore, enhancing the expression level of these two enzymes will increase the flux to 2-keto-phenylbutyric acid. as is shown in figure  carbon flow through the shikimate pathway is controlled by modulation of dahp. in e. coli, three unlinked genes arof, arog and aroh encode three isoenzymes of dahp synthase, respectively. among these genes, arof was proved to play a positive effect for biosynthesis of phenylalanine. chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase was also identified as a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of phenylalanine. pmw an expression vector identified to be able to replicate in e. sp. cgmcc was used to express phea and arof. expression of the proteins was evaluated by sds-page analysis. two specific bands, with the right molecular masses, were able to be observed apparently at the recombinant strain, compared to the negative control. the wild type e. sp. cgmcc can produce  mg l- 2-pe when cultured in production medium for about 12 h. the plasmid pmw13_phea_arof was transformed to enhance phenylpyruvate biosynthesis to combine with the alcohol producing pathway to achieve 2-pe production. the 2-pe production was about  mg l-1after incubation in shake flask for 12 h, and it is times as high as the wild strain. when phenylalanine was added to the production medium at the concentration of 5 g l- 2-pe production was 530 mg l- it’s much higher than the 469 μm that james c. liao et al. reported. according to phenylpyruvate pathway, two mol phosphoenolpyruvate, one mol erythrose-4-phosphate and one mol adenosine triphosphate can form one mol phenylpyruvate which can be then converted to one mol 2-pe with two mol nadph then. according to the maximum theoretical yield, when 1 g 2-pe was produced,  g glucose or  g phenylalanine was needed. however, the price of phenylalanine was about folds that of glucose in china. the cheaper sugars make the strain more competitive for industrial production. though the titer of  mg l- was still lower than the previous report by s. cerevisiae, further optimization, including fed-batch fermentation, addition of extractive solvent, could be done to elevate the yield of 2-pe.  a new strain e. sp. cgmcc which is able to produce 2-pe using de-novo pathway with monosaccharide as carbon source and nh4cl as nitrogen source was isolated and identified. the strain can synthesize 2-pe through phenylpyruvate pathway. two rate-limiting enzymes, phea and dahp synthase from e. coli were then overexpressed in e. sp. cgmcc to construct engineered e. sp for 2-pe production. the engineered strain can produce  mg l- 2-pe for about 12 h. the substrate specificity of 2-keto-acid decarboxylase and the existence of phenylpyruvate pathway make e. sp. cgmcc a good candidate for 2-pe production. "," 2-phenylethanl and its derivatives are important chemicals, which are widely used in food materials and fine chemical industries and polymers and it’s also a potentially valuable alcohol for next-generation biofuel. however, the biosynthesis of 2-pe are mainly biotransformed from phenylalanine, the price of which barred the production. therefore, it is necessary to seek more sustainable technologies for 2-pe production.  a new strain which produces 2-pe through the phenylpyruvate pathway was isolated and identified as enterobacter sp. cgmcc the strain is able to use renewable monosaccharide as the carbon source and nh4cl as the nitrogen source to produce 2-pe. two genes of rate-limiting enzymes, chorismate mutase p-prephenate dehydratase and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase, were cloned from escherichia coli and overexpressed in e. sp. cgmcc the engineered e. sp. cgmcc produces  mg l- 2-pe in 12 h, which is times as high as the wild strain.  the phenylpyruvate pathway and the substrate specificity of 2-keto-acid decarboxylase towards phenylpyruvate were found in e. sp. cgmcc combined with the low-cost monosaccharide as the substrate, the finding provides a novel and potential way for 2-pe production. 2-phenylethanolbiosynthesisehrlich pathwayenterobacter sp ",42431760-05de-4c0e-a770-ba397cd5c24c,pubmed
8," bovine enterotoxemia caused by clostridium perfringens, is a sudden death syndrome with necro-hemorrhagic lesions in the small intestine, which mainly affects suckling calves and veal calves. in veal calves, predominantly beef cattle breeds are affected. the syndrome accounts for approximately 20% of the mortalities in these calves, compared to 4% in dairy and mixed breed veal calves. clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic gram-positive spore-forming bacterium, which is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract of both humans and animals, and is also ubiquitous in soil and sewage. strains of c. perfringens are classified into five toxinotypes based on the presence of four major toxin genes. mainly strains of type a are recovered from enterotoxemia cases but also from the intestine of healthy cattle and other warm-blooded animals as well as from the environment. c. perfringens type a has the ability to produce numerous extracellular toxins and enzymes, of which alpha toxin is the most toxic. recently alpha toxin, a phospholipase c, and perfringolysin o, a pore forming cytolysin, have been proposed as essential factors for induction of enterotoxemia. in addition to these toxins, other potential virulence factors might have a role in the pathology of enterotoxemia. possible virulence traits can be proteolytic factors that degrade the protective mucus layer and extracellular matrix components or intra-species inhibitory antibacterial substances that confer a selective advantage to the producing strain, as suggested for necrotic enteritis strains in broilers. it is hitherto unclear whether the c. perfringens type a strains isolated from enterotoxemia cases are more virulent than other type a strains. in a calf intestinal loop model, it has been shown that c. perfringens strains isolated from healthy and enterotoxemic cattle as well as from other host species are all capable of inducing necro-hemorrhagic intestinal lesions. the purpose of this study was to analyze the expression of virulence factors that are potentially involved in enterotoxemia. to approach this, the alpha toxin and perfringolysin o production, the mucinolytic and gelatinolytic activity as well as the intra-species inhibitory activity of a collection of strains originating from enterotoxemia cases was compared to bovine strains isolated from healthy animals and to strains isolated from other animal species.  clostridium perfringens strains from enterotoxemia cases are not superior alpha toxin and perfringolysin o producers to determine whether alpha toxin and perfringolysin o levels differ between bovine enterotoxemia strains and strains from other sources, the culture supernatants of various type a strains were tested. lecithin breakdown was used as a measure of alpha toxin activity. the supernatants of the different strains showed high variability in alpha toxin activity, independent of their origin. in eight strains, the alpha toxin activity was below the detection limit of 10- u/ml. perfringolysin o activity was determined by measuring the hemolysis of horse erythrocytes. supernatants of strains originating from bovine enterotoxemia cases showed a high variability in hemolytic activity. the mean erythrocyte hydrolysis by strains from bovine enterotoxemia was not significantly different from other strains, independent of the origin. for both alpha toxin and perfringolysin o, no significant differences between enterotoxemia strains and other c. perfringens strains could be observed. mucinolytic and gelatinolytic activity is not higher in clostridium perfringens strains from bovine enterotoxemia cases the thickness of the mucin layer reflects an equilibrium between synthesis by the host and bacterial degradation by the intestinal microbiota. we tested the mucinolytic activity of c. perfringens strains from enterotoxemia cases and from other sources to evaluate whether enterotoxemia strains have higher potential to degrade the protective mucus layer. all strains exhibited similar mucinolytic activity. to elucidate whether c. perfringens proteases might have the potential to contribute to the pathology of enterotoxemia, gelatinolytic activity was investigated as a measure for degrading extracellular matrix components within the gut. gelatin was used as a specific proteolytic substrate to screen for clostridial protease activity that might contribute to intestinal host matrix degradation. a high variability of gelatinolytic activity was seen. the mean gelatin breakdown by strains from bovine enterotoxemia was not different from other strains, independent of the origin. no significant difference between the groups could be observed. enterotoxemia strains have no increased intra-species growth-inhibitory activity the intra-species growth-inhibitory activity is shown in figure  of all tested strains, sixty-one percent was able to inhibit growth of at least one other c. perfringens strain. there was a lot of variation between the inhibitory spectra of the tested strains. some strains inhibited only a limited number of strains, while others had a broad inhibitory spectrum. five out of eight enterotoxemia strains, eight out of twenty-three strains from healthy calves, four out of five ruminating bovine strains and one out of five sheep strains were unable to inhibit growth of any other strain. no significant differences between the groups could be observed. discussion clostridium perfringens type a strains isolated from bovine enterotoxemia cases showed no difference in in vitro expression of a selection of potential virulence factors compared to strains from healthy cattle as well as various other animal species. this is in accordance with the capacity of lesion induction in a calf intestinal loop model, in which all tested strains are capable of inducing necro-hemorrhagic intestinal lesions, independent of the origin of the isolate. no increased activity of the alpha toxin and perfringolysin o was detected in bovine enterotoxemia strains. in a recent study carried out with alpha toxin and perfringolysin o mutants we demonstrated an essential role of both toxins in bovine enterotoxemia. the alpha toxin is the most toxic enzyme produced by c. perfringens type a strains and hydrolyses two major constituents of the eukaryotic membrane causing membrane disruption and cell lysis. in sublytic concentrations, alpha toxin leads to activation of signal transduction pathways and uncontrolled production of intracellular mediators. perfringolysin o is a pore-forming cytolysin which has the ability to kill eukaryotic cells by punching holes in their membranes. as shown in vitro and in a calf intestinal loop model, alpha toxin and perfringolysin o seem to have a synergistic action in bovine enterotoxemia. considering this essential role of alpha toxin and perfringolysin o in bovine enterotoxemia, c. perfringens type a strains with higher activity of these toxins might be more virulent. despite the importance of alpha toxin and perfringolysin o in enterotoxemia, strains originating from diseased animals showed no higher activities of these toxins in vitro. no increased collagen degrading and mucinolytic potential was detected in strains from enterotoxemia cases. collagen is widely distributed throughout the body and is an integral component of the connective tissue. collagen disruption by bacterial collagenases may result in the loss of tissue integrity and subsequent tissue necrosis in the infected host and allow penetration of bacterial toxins to deeper tissues. therefore, the ability to produce collagenase may play an important role in the tissue destruction observed in bovine enterotoxemia. this in vitro study showed no difference in collagen destroying potential between c. perfringens strains from bovine enterotoxemia cases compared to strains from healthy cattle, sheep and chickens. in addition to the collagen degradation, the mucinolytic activity of the c. perfringens strains may also contribute to the pathology of bovine enterotoxemia. the gastrointestinal tract represents a large surface of the host that interacts with the external world. a protective mucus layer covers the epithelial surface, forming a barrier between the lumen and the intestinal epithelium. it is a potential binding site for both commensal and pathogenic organisms. c. perfringens type a strains with stronger mucinolytic activity may have an advantage in colonizing and degrading the protective mucus layer, which may lead to a compromised barrier function. enterotoxemia strains, however were not different from the other strains with respect to their mucinolytic activity in vitro. another possible virulence trait that was explored is the ability to cause intra-species growth-inhibition. the potential of a pathogenic strain to suppress the growth of other c. perfringens strains has been shown in necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens, leading to single clone dominance in a broiler flock suffering from necrotic enteritis. in contrast to the situation in broiler chickens, our results showed no difference in intra-species growth-inhibition between the enterotoxemia strains and other c. perfringens strains. in addition, a clonal population of c. perfringens does not seem to be essential for the development of bovine enterotoxemia as seen by rapd. together this suggests that intra-species growth-inhibition probably does not play a role in the pathogenesis of bovine enterotoxemia. none of the possible virulence traits examined in this study were distinctive for c. perfringens type a strains isolated from bovine enterotoxemia cases in vitro. this is in accordance with a recent observation from our laboratory that, when the conditions are favorable, strains from different origin are capable to provoke necro-hemorrhagic lesions in an intestinal loop model. it cannot be ruled out that other possible virulence factors may be involved in disease. this was the case for necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens, an enteric disease caused by c. perfringens type a strains. the essential virulence factor for causing disease remained unclear until the netb toxin, a previously unknown toxin specific for necrotic enteritis, was found. although the presence of such an undiscovered toxin in the pathology of bovine enterotoxemia cannot be excluded, it is unlikely because type a strains originating from bovine enterotoxemia cases as well as from healthy cattle and other animal species are capable of inducing lesions in an intestinal loop model.  strains from bovine enterotoxemia cases did not have a higher alpha toxin, perfringolysin o, mucinolytic or gelatinolytic activity in comparison to strains isolated from healthy cattle and other animal species. also production of intra-species inhibitory substances was not higher in bovine enterotoxemia strains. this could indicate that yet another, hitherto unknown, c. perfringens virulence factor might be involved in the pathogenesis of calf enterotoxemia. taking these results together with our previous observations that strains from various origin can induce the typical lesions in an intestinal loop model, it seems however more plausible that the primary trigger in bovine enterotoxemia is not c. perfringens and that c. perfringens is merely responsible for propagating and exacerbating the intestinal damage to the point that it becomes hemorrhagic and necrotic. "," bovine enterotoxemia is a major cause of mortality in veal calves. predominantly veal calves of beef cattle breeds are affected and losses due to enterotoxemia may account for up to 20% of total mortality. clostridium perfringens type a is considered to be the causative agent. recently, alpha toxin and perfringolysin o have been proposed to play an essential role in the development of disease. however, other potential virulence factors also may play a role in the pathogenesis of bovine enterotoxemia. the aim of this study was to evaluate whether strains originating from bovine enterotoxemia cases were superior in in vitro production of virulence factors that are potentially involved in enterotoxemia. to approach this, a collection of strains originating from enterotoxemia cases was compared to bovine strains isolated from healthy animals and to strains isolated from other animal species.  strains originating from bovine enterotoxemia cases produced variable levels of alpha toxin and perfringolysin o that were not significantly different from levels produced by strains isolated from healthy calves and other animal species. all tested strains exhibited similar mucinolytic activity independent of the isolation source. a high variability in collagenase activity between strains could be observed, and no higher collagenase levels were produced in vitro by strains isolated from enterotoxemia cases.  bovine enterotoxemia strains do not produce higher levels of alpha toxin, perfringolysin o, mucinase and collagenase, as compared to strains derived from healthy calves and other animal species in vitro.

9," salmonella enterica, with over different serovars, is indigenous to the gastrointestinal tracts of many mammals, birds, and reptiles, usually in low levels. salmonella can be pathogenic in these animals if it reaches certain numbers in vivo. however, moribund animals are usually culled before they reach slaughter. therefore, the food safety problem relative to humans is that salmonella can be carried into the processing plant in healthy asymptomatic animals. if cross-contamination occurs during the slaughter process, salmonella can then be transferred to carcasses that were previously uncontaminated. a significant increase in the number of salmonella positive broilers between exiting the scalding water immersion tank and exiting the crop extractor demonstrates how in-plant cross-contamination can occur. when carcasses were sampled at points in processing, an increase occurred in the presence of salmonella from 19% pre-scald to % post-chill. regardless of whether the source of contamination was pre-harvest or during processing, salmonella is difficult to remove from carcasses due to its ability to adhere to chicken skin and endure the stages of processing. laboratory research, as well as in-plant trials, has demonstrated this relationship. therefore, persistence of salmonella within the processing plant may be partially explained by interactions between chicken skin and salmonella. chemical treatments have been developed and shown to be effective under controlled conditions in the reduction of salmonella levels on broiler carcasses or skin. in spite of these efforts, salmonella is yet to be eliminated from the process. when testing the efficacy of different antimicrobial compounds, conventional cultural techniques are typically used. the product is sampled, microbiological culturing protocols are followed, and to hours later the results are known. bioluminescence imaging is a technique that can be used for real-time quantification and tracking of live bacteria in hosts. to enable bli, bacteria are tagged with bacterial luciferase, which catalyzes the oxidation of a long-chain aldehyde and fmnh to cause emission of visible light. salmonella strains constitutively expressing bacterial luciferase have no significant alterations in phenotype, including growth kinetics or biochemical, serological, or structural phenotypes. advantages of the bacterial luciferase reporter system include negligible background, no toxic or phenotypic effects from accumulation of signal, real-time detection, and no need for addition of an exogenous substrate. in addition, bioluminescence from bacterial luciferase correlates well with the amount of luciferase protein and lux mrna, bacterial plate counts, and intracellular numbers of bacteria in cell culture. in this research, our aim was to develop twelve bioluminescent salmonella enterica strains that can be used for real-time monitoring of the pathogen's growth on food products. our study is unique in that it includes multiple salmonella field strains isolated from the broiler production continuum, including post hatchery, prior to harvest, arrival at the plant, pre-chill tank, and post-chill tank.  bioluminescent salmonella strains paklux was transferred to twelve salmonella strains that we isolated in a study on the poultry production and processing continuum. the strains represented the twelve most commonly isolated serovars from our study. this result compared favorably with a previous report where transformation of a lux plasmid into salmonella isolates from a poultry processing plant was only successful for one isolate out of seven attempted. expression of the luxcdabe operon, which encodes bacterial luciferase, was driven by the lacz promoter on paklux because salmonella does not have laciq in its chromosome, it constitutively expresses the lacz promoter on paklux and hence produces continuous light while it is alive and metabolically active. we showed that bacteria numbers and bioluminescence correlated well in all strains used. the minimum detectable numbers for all twelve strains was less than cfu/ml, and it was less than cfu/ml for a majority of strains. this result was comparable to previous studies. the average theoretical light intensity per cfu was calculated for each strain and revealed a greater than 10-fold difference between some serovars. this difference was not due to lack of viability; bacterial plate counts showed that all the strains were viable at this stage and that viable bacterial densities for all the serovars were within a fold range. the difference in luminescence could reflect a difference between serovars in efficiency of luxcdabe expression from the lacz promoter, or it could reflect a difference between serovars in the activity of bacterial luciferase within the bacteria. alternatively, the difference could reflect differences in metabolic activity between the serovars at this stage of growth. bioluminescence is known to correlate well with bacterial metabolism. plasmid stability the stability of paklux was determined by subculturing bioluminescent salmonella broth cultures under selective and non-selective conditions for days. bioluminescence of salmonella strains cultured under non-selective conditions was declining by day and continued declining linearly until the conclusion of the experiment. based on the data, the average half-life of paklux in salmonella was approximately days under the described culture conditions. however, the stability varied between salmonella serovars. among the salmonella strains, plasmid stability was lower in s. kentucky and s. typhimurium as compared to the others. the half-life of paklux was about days in s. kentucky and about days in s. typhimurium. s. newport, s. slachua, and s. enteritidis maintained paklux longer than others, with a half life of about days. paklux is derived from the broad host range plasmid pbbr which is relatively stable in gram-negative bacteria in the absence of antibiotic selection. paklux was stable in the gram-negative species edwardsiella ictaluri for at least days without antibiotic selection, and the plasmid caused no alterations in growth kinetics, native plasmids, and pathogenicity as compared to the parent strain. data from the current study indicates that the pbbr replicon is not as stable in salmonella as it is in other gram-negative bacteria. however, bioluminescent salmonella strains labeled with paklux should be suitable for short term experiments in which antibiotic selection cannot be applied. characterization of skin attachment properties of salmonella strains we developed an in vitro skin attachment model for characterization of attachment properties of different salmonella strains using bli. bioluminescence was successfully detected on chicken skin after being exposed to salmonella strains expressing paklux using this model, we were able to show that salmonella strains from different serovars vary in their ability to attach to chicken skin. bacteria numbers in s. seftenberg, s. thompson, and s. schwarzengrund were significantly different from each other and from other strains. the s. heidelberg strain had significantly less binding to chicken skin than all the other strains and was fold lower than s. seftenberg, which had the highest amount of binding. this result suggests that salmonella strains vary in their ability to bind to chicken skin; this ability may be a discriminating factor determining whether salmonella strains persist through processing or whether they are removed. the effect of washing on salmonella removal from chicken skin bioluminescence was an effective tool for measuring the effects of washing for removal of salmonella from chicken skin using our model. bioluminescent salmonella strains have been previously utilized to monitor progress of infection, effect of heat and ph treatments, growth in food samples, and toxicity. one study used a single bioluminescent salmonella hadar isolate to investigate the effectiveness of washing for removal of salmonella from turkey skin. the current study demonstrates, for the first time, use of bli for real-time monitoring of twelve salmonella strains using a chicken skin model. as a general trend observed from all strains, washing suppressed the reproduction of salmonella on chicken skin, probably due to physical removal of bacteria. in non-washed skin samples, salmonella numbers increased steadily over the two hour incubation period, with final numbers showing an increase ranging from 143% to 459% compared to initial measurement at time zero. in washed skin samples, the increase in salmonella numbers was lower, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple agitation in water for suppressing salmonella growth on chicken skin. for all strains, the washed treatments had a significantly lower change in bioluminescence than the corresponding non-washed treatments after the h wash period. however, there was strain variation in the effectiveness of washing. for three strains, washing reduced the number of salmonella present on chicken skin at min compared to min. for the other strains, although washing did not decrease the number of salmonella on chicken skin, it was effective in significantly reducing the growth relative to non-washed samples. when the differences in bioluminescence between washed and non-washed treatments at min were compared across strains, the decrease in bioluminescence for s. newport caused by washing was significantly greater than the decrease in bioluminescence for s. alachua, s. braenderup, s. enteritidis, and s. schwarzengrund. thus, based on the difference in bioluminescence between washed and non-washed treatments, washing was apparently most effective in removing s. newport and least effective for s. alachua, s. braenderup, s. enteritidis, and s. schwarzengrund. however, it is interesting to note that the two strains that attached to chicken skin most effectively were also able to increase their numbers in the wash treatment most effectively over the hr incubation.  our results demonstrate that paklux is effective for labeling salmonella enterica strains with bioluminescence. using this tool, we were able to develop twelve bioluminescent salmonella strains that were isolated from the poultry production/processing continuum. however, stability results indicated that paklux is not as stable in salmonella as it is in other gram-negative species. therefore, this labeling system may not be useful for long-term experiments, and work is already in progress in our group to develop a labeling system for salmonella that is more stable. our work also shows that bioluminescence is an effective and sensitive method to monitor salmonella on food products. in particular, our study demonstrates that salmonella strains vary in their ability to attach to chicken skin. future research aimed at determining whether the ability to attach to chicken skin correlates with the ability to persist in poultry production/processing environments is warranted. finally, our results indicate that simple washing in an agitated water bath can remove contaminating salmonella from chicken skin, but this method alone cannot eliminate the salmonella completely due to strong bacterial attachment to skin. therefore, additional methodologies should be used in poultry processing to eliminate salmonella from the chicken skin to prevent disease outbreaks. the skin model developed in this study should be very useful for testing alternative strategies in addition to washing procedures. "," salmonella can reside in healthy animals without the manifestation of any adverse effects on the carrier. if raw products of animal origin are not handled properly during processing or cooked to a proper temperature during preparation, salmonellosis can occur. in this research, we developed bioluminescent salmonella strains that can be used for real-time monitoring of the pathogen's growth on food products. to accomplish this, twelve salmonella strains from the broiler production continuum were transformed with the broad host range plasmid paklux and a chicken skin attachment model was developed.  salmonella strains carrying paklux constitutively expressed the luxcdabe operon and were therefore detectable using bioluminescence. strains were characterized in terms of bioluminescence properties and plasmid stability. to assess the usefulness of bioluminescent salmonella strains in food safety studies, we developed an attachment model using chicken skin. the effect of washing on attachment of salmonella strains to chicken skin was tested using bioluminescent strains, which revealed the attachment properties of each strain.  this study demonstrated that bioluminescence is a sensitive and effective tool to detect salmonella on food products in real-time. bioluminescence imaging is a promising technology that can be utilized to evaluate new food safety measures for reducing salmonella contamination on food products.

10," the biological function of a protein is essentially associated with its tertiary structure, which is believed to be determined by its amino acid sequence via the process of protein folding. therefore, the prediction of protein's tertiary structure from amino acid sequences is a very important while challenging task in computational biology and proteomics. the tertiary structure can be broadly categorized into four structural classes based on the types and arrangements of their secondary structural elements. they are the α class in which proteins contain mainly helices, the β class containing mainly strands, and the other two classes with a mixture of α helices and β strands - the α + β class having β strands mainly antiparallel and the α/β class having β strands mainly parallel. it is of great value to predict protein structural classes as it is beneficial to study protein function, regulation and interactions. for instance, the searching scope of conformation will be significantly reduced for proteins whose structural classes are known. a number of methods have been proposed to predict protein structural classes from amino acid sequences. they mainly differ in the selection of feature sets used for prediction. the most common features are on the basis of the amino acid composition, which generally represent a protein as a twenty-dimensional vector corresponding to the frequencies of twenty amino acids in a given protein amino acid sequence. however, these features ignored the important sequence order information which has been shown beneficial to the predictions. to overcome this limitation, various new features were developed on the basis of a so-called pseudo amino acid composition, and have been shown very successful in the prediction of protein structural classes, especially for high-homology protein datasets. however, when low-homology datasets with pairwise sequence identity below 40% were tested, these methods were not effective any more. for instance, for the widely used dataset 25pdb whose sequence homology is about 25%, the reported overall accuracies with these methods were about 60% only. recently, kurgan et al. proposed to extract features from the predicted secondary structure content rather than directly from the protein's amino acid sequence, and reported that the higher prediction accuracy can be consequently achieved, for instance, the overall accuracy of % for the dataset 25pdb. in this study, we would like to introduce a new comprehensive feature set that was also constructed from the predicted secondary structure, and demonstrate by experiments on three benchmark datasets that the prediction of protein structural classes can be further improved for low-homology amino acid sequences.  the proposed method in the first step, we use the tool psipred to predict the protein secondary structure for an amino acid sequence of interest. then, the chaos game representation is employed to represent a predicted secondary structure as two time series, from which we generate a comprehensive set of features using recurrence quantification analysis, k-string based information entropy and segment-based analysis. the recurrence quantification analysis aims to capture the sequence order information of the time series, the k-string based information entropy to reflect certain local interactions along the secondary structure, and the segment-based analysis to characterize the spacial arrangements of α helices and β strands. finally, the resulting 24-dimensional feature vector is fed into a simple yet powerful fisher's discriminant algorithm to make prediction of its protein structural class. please see the section methods for the details on the feature construction. a web server that implements the proposed method is freely available at. prediction accuracies for three benchmark datasets the proposed method is tested on three benchmark datasets in low homology, including 25pdb that comprises proteins of about 25% sequence identity, that comprises proteins of about 25% sequence identity and that comprises proteins of about 40% sequence identity. the resulting prediction accuracies are listed in table it can be seen that the overall accuracies for the three datasets are all above 80%. to be specific, the overall accuracies of %, % and % are achieved for the datasets 25pdb, and respectively. if comparing the four structural classes to each other, the predictions of proteins in the α classes are always the best. the accuracies are evaluated by jackknife test and measured by the percentage of correctly predicted proteins. the best results are highlighted in bold face. we also obtained satisfactory prediction accuracies for proteins in the β and α/β classes. however, it seems very challenging to predict proteins in α + β classes as their prediction accuracies are relatively low when compared with the other classes. as a previous study pointed out, the low prediction accuracy of the α + β class might be due to its non-negligible overlap with the other classes. comparison with existing methods the proposed method were compared with ten existing methods, and the experimental results are listed in table except for the method scpred, the listed accuracy values are taken directly from their respective references. because some inconsistencies were found between our test dataset 25pdb and the one used in to test scpred, the direct comparison with the accuracy values reported in would not be fair. therefore, to ensure a fair comparison, we re-implemented the method scpred by following the details presented in the reference paper, trained its classifier with the same version of psipred used for our method, and then applied it to our test dataset 25pdb. it turns out that, the obtained accuracy values for predicting proteins in the α, β, α + β and α/β classes are %, %, % and %, respectively, giving rise to the improvements of % % and % for the first three classes over those given in the reference paper. the overall prediction accuracy hence increases by % with our test dataset as well. these new accuracy values are listed in table and we use them as the performance measurements of the method scpred for comparison. from table we can see that the proposed method achieved the highest overall prediction accuracies among all the tested methods. by compared to the second highest accuracy values that were obtained with the method scpred, there are improvements of %, %, and 3% for the three test datasets, respectively. we also notice that significant improvements were made in particular for the α + β class and the α/β class. for example, the proposed method obtained the % accuracy for predicting proteins of the α/β class from the dataset 25pdb, which is % higher than that given by the method scpred. when the dataset is tested, the accuracy for predicting proteins of the α + β class is % higher than that given by the method scpred. bear in mind that both scpred and our proposed method use features that are extracted from the secondary structure predicted with psipred. the prediction improvements hence clearly indicate that our features are more comprehensive and informative than those used by scpred. contribution of features to represent a protein, we used three different approaches to extract features from the predicted secondary structure sequences -- recurrence quantification analysis, k-string based information entropy, and segment-based analysis. for brevity, let r, k and s denote the feature subsets generated by these three approaches, respectively. below, we investigate how these feature subsets contribute to the prediction results. r k s see text for the notations of r, k and s. differentiating between the α + β and α/β classes because the segment-based features are aimed to mainly differentiate between the α + β and α/β classes, it is very interesting to know how effective they are. to avoid any potential outside effects, we would like to make tests on datasets that comprise proteins only from the α + β and α/β classes. for this purpose, we generate a subset for each benchmark dataset by removing all the proteins in the α class or the β class, and then train the classifier on these reduced subsets instead of the whole datasets. the datasets comprise only proteins in the α + β and α/β classes.  to predict structural classes for low-homology protein sequences for which the pairwise sequence identity lies between 20% and 40%, existing methods work very poorly with only relatively low accuracies obtained. in this paper, we aim to develop a new method so as to improve the prediction accuracy. to do so, we first use psipred to predict the secondary structure sequence from a given amino acid sequence. then, the chaos game representation is employed to represent the predicted secondary structure as two time series, from which a comprehensive set of features are generated by three different approaches -- that is, the recurrence quantification analysis, k-string based information entropy, and segment-based analysis. the resulting feature vectors, each representing one protein, are fed into fisher's discriminant algorithm for the final prediction of protein structural classes. experimental results showed that all these features can make their own positive and complementary contributions so that higher prediction accuracies are achieved. for example, to predict structural classes of proteins in the dataset 25pdb, it achieved the accuracies of %, %, % and % for the α, β, α + β and α/β classes, respectively, and the overall accuracy of %, which is % higher than that given by the state-of-the-art method scpred. by comparisons with ten existing methods, we may attribute the high prediction accuracy of the proposed method to the superior performance of psipred in predicting secondary structures and the comprehensive set of features that we constructed. the first attribution can be seen from the comparison with the method proposed in, which used the secondary structure prediction tool developed in instead of psipred. a previous study showed that psipred is superior to other competing secondary structure prediction methods. the second attribution can be seen from the comparison with the method scpred, which differs from our proposed method mainly in the selection of features. we used three different approaches to extract a comprehensive set of features from the predicted secondary structures, where the recurrence quantification analysis is used to capture the sequence order information of the time series, the k-string based information entropy to reflect certain local interactions along the secondary structure, and the segment-based features to characterize the spacial arrangements of α helices and β strands. thus, our proposed method may provide a promising tool for the accurate prediction of protein structural classes, in particular for low-homology amino acid sequences. "," prediction of protein structural classes from amino acid sequences is of great importance, as it is beneficial to study protein function, regulation and interactions. many methods have been developed for high-homology protein sequences, and the prediction accuracies can achieve up to 90%. however, for low-homology sequences whose average pairwise sequence identity lies between 20% and 40%, they perform relatively poorly, yielding the prediction accuracy often below 60%.  we propose a new method to predict protein structural classes on the basis of features extracted from the predicted secondary structures of proteins rather than directly from their amino acid sequences. it first uses psipred to predict the secondary structure for each protein sequence. then, the chaos game representation is employed to represent the predicted secondary structure as two time series, from which we generate a comprehensive set of features using recurrence quantification analysis, k-string based information entropy and segment-based analysis. the resulting feature vectors are finally fed into a simple yet powerful fisher's discriminant algorithm for the prediction of protein structural classes. we tested the proposed method on three benchmark datasets in low homology and achieved the overall prediction accuracies of %, % and %, respectively. comparisons with ten existing methods showed that our method consistently performs better for all the tested datasets and the overall accuracy improvements range from % to %. a web server that implements the proposed method is freely available at http://www spms.ntu.edu.sg/~chenxin/rks_ppsc/.  the high prediction accuracy achieved by our proposed method is attributed to the design of a comprehensive feature set on the predicted secondary structure sequences, which is capable of characterizing the sequence order information, local interactions of the secondary structural elements, and spacial arrangements of α helices and β strands. thus, it is a valuable method to predict protein structural classes particularly for low-homology amino acid sequences. 18- january the eighth asia pacific bioinformatics conference bangalore, india ",1fe5356f-6684-421e-bbbc-a719cfb4967f,pubmed
11," the horse was one of the earliest domesticated species and has played numerous important roles in human societies: acting as a source of food, a means of transport, for draught and agricultural work, and for sport, hunting, and warfare. horse domestication is believed to have started in the western asian steppes approximately years ago, and quickly spread across the eurasian continent, with herds being augmented by the recruitment of local wild horses. domestication in the iberian peninsula might have represented an additional independent episode, involving horses that survived in a steppe refuge following the reforestation of central europe during the holocene. the horse reference genome has provided fundamental genomic information on the equine lineage and has been used for improving the health and performance of horses. horses exhibit genetic traits and/or diseases that are similar to those of humans. to date, several horse whole genomes have been sequenced and analyzed. in the first whole genome re-sequencing analysis was conducted on the quarter horse breed to identify novel genetic variants. in divergence times among horse fossils, donkey, przewalski's horse, and several domestic horses were estimated, together with their demographic history. however, currently available whole genome sequences of modern horses only comprise western eurasian breeds. over the centuries, more than distinct horse breeds have been established by genetic selection for a wide number of desired phenotypic traits. the marwari horse is a rare breed from the marwar region of india, and is one of six distinct horse breeds of india. they are believed to be descended from native indian ponies, which were crossed with arabian horses beginning around the 12th century, possibly with some mongolian influence. the marwari horses were trained to perform complex prancing and leaping movements for ceremonial purposes. the marwari population in india deteriorated in the early 1900s due to improper management of the breeding stock, and only a few thousand purebred marwari horses remain. here, we report the first whole genome sequence of a male marwari horse as one of the asian breeds and characterize its genetic variations, including single nucleotide variations, small insertions/deletions, and copy number variations. to investigate relationships among different horse breeds, we carried out a genome-wide comparative analysis using previously reported whole genome sequences of six western eurasian breeds, and single nucleotide polymorphism array data of horses from worldwide breeds. our results provide insights into its genetic background and origin, and identify genotypes associated with the marwari-specific phenotypes.  whole genome sequencing and variation detection genomic dna was obtained from a blood sample of a male marwari horse and was sequenced using an illumina hiseq sequencer. a total of gb of paired-end sequence data were produced with a read length of bp and insert sizes of and bp from two genomic libraries. a total of, reads remained after filtering, and, reads were mapped to the horse reference genome with a mapping rate of %.. a total of, reads were identified as duplicates and were removed from further analyses. to enhance the mapping quality, we applied the indelrealigner algorithm to the de-duplicated reads. a total of, reads were realigned, and the average mapping quality increased from to. the whole genome sequences covered % of the reference genome at × or greater depth. to identify novel genomic sequences, we performed a de novo assembly using the unmapped reads to the horse reference genome. a total of contigs were assembled. after mapping the contigs to the reference genome, we found that contigs did not match the reference sequences; indicating that they may be novel regions specific to the marwari horse breed. to identify the biological functions of these novel regions, the un-matched contigs were further analyzed by blast searches using the ncbi protein database. however, none of the contigs significantly matched the known protein database. comparing the marwari sequence to the reference genome, approximately million snvs and million indels were identified. estimates of snp rate and heterozygosity of the marwari were similar to those of other horse breeds. we assessed the mutational frequency at the single nucleotide level in the marwari and compared it to estimates from other breeds. interestingly, we found that the prevalent mutation types were not consistent among horse breeds. the mutation spectrum of the marwari was dominated by c>t transitions; a pattern which was also observed in the icelandic, norwegian fjord, and quarter horses. conversely, the genomes of the arabian, standardbred, and thoroughbred horses were dominated by a>g transitions. a significant association between the mutation spectrum and horse breed was found when we applied a chi-square test using spss to statistically compare the differences in the mutation spectrums among the breeds. the marwari genome consisted of, homozygous and, heterozygous snvs. among them, were found to be nonsynonymous snvs. when the marwari variants were compared to those previously reported from the genomes of other breeds and the horse snp database from the broad institute,, snvs and indels were novel variants. of these, variants represented amino acid changes which were found in genes. to annotate the variants using well-known functional databases, human orthologs were retrieved from the ensembl biomart utility. a total of of the genes had human orthologs, and genes were annotated using the david bioinformatics resource. the genes with nssnvs and/or indels in coding regions were highly enriched in olfactory functions. copy number variations were identified using the r library ""readdepth package"". a total of cnvs, including gain and loss blocks, were identified in the marwari genome. the sizes ranged from kb to mb with an average length of kb. the cnv region contained genes which were duplicated or deleted. from the functional enrichment analysis, we found that the duplicated genes were enriched in olfactory function, whereas the deleted genes were enriched in immune regulation and metabolic processes. relatedness to other horse breeds we constructed a phylogenetic tree using snvs found in the whole genome data of the seven horse breeds. we identified, nucleotide positions that were commonly found in the seven horse genomes. a total of nucleotide positions were used for phylogenetic analysis after filtering for minor allele frequency, genotyping rate, and linkage disequilibrium. we found that the marwari horse is most closely related to the arabian breed, while the icelandic horse and norwegian fjord were the most distinct from the other breeds, all of which are known to descend from arabian horses. to further explore the relationships among breeds, we compared the marwari horse genome data with snp array data from individual horses belonging to domestic breeds. a total of nucleotide positions were shared across all individuals including the marwari horse. after pruning as described above, nucleotide positions were used for the comparative analyses. we calculated pairwise genetic distances and conducted multidimensional scaling to visualize the relationships among the horse breeds. the marwari horse fell together with iberian-lineage breeds, such as the andalusian, mangalarga paulista, peruvian paso, and morgan horse breeds, all of which are known to have an arabian ancestry. additionally, we found that the marwari horse fell between arabian and mongolian horses, indicating their dual genetic influences on the marwari horse as previously suggested. we applied the structure program to estimate the genetic composition of the asian horse breeds including the marwari horse. for k = groups, the arabian horses were strongly separated from mongolian horses, and the genetic composition of the marwari horse was composed of alleles clustering with both the mongolian horse and the arabian horse. other asian breeds also showed genetic admixture between arabian and mongolian horses. from k = to k = the marwari had high genetic components of both arabian and mongolian horses, whereas akhal teke and caspian horses were mostly assigned to other clusters. these results indicate that the marwari is genetically closely related to the arabian and mongolian horses. it is unclear whether the latter relationship represents direct genetic input from mongolian horses or whether these horses are the closest population to the indian ponies from which the marwari is thought to have descended. further analysis including indian ponies and marwari horses will be required to distinguish the relative importance of these two scenarios, which are not mutually exclusive. phenotype association of the identified variants to provide insight into the unique marwari phenotypes, we investigated amino acid changes specific to this breed compared to those of other breeds. a total of amino acid changes in genes were unique to the marwari horse. among the genes, genes included one or more amino acid changes predicted by the polyphen program to alter protein function. interestingly, the teashirt zinc finger family member gene had a homozygous p.ala344>val variant. tshz is involved in transcriptional regulation of developmental processes and is associated with congenital aural atresia in humans, a malformation of the ear occurring in approximately in births. additionally, tshz1-deficient mice show malformations in the middle ear components. therefore, the a334v amino acid change in tshz is a strong candidate as the genetic factor responsible for the inward-turning ear tips characteristic of the marwari breed. a future genomic comparison with the kathiawari horse, which also has inward-turning ear tips, might support to this prediction. after annotating the marwari variants for their known disease and trait information, we found that this breed has a homozygous variant for the g.27991841a>g mutation in the scl26a gene, which causes autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia in equine. other variants were associated with racing endurance in thoroughbred horses, horse size, and pattern of locomotion., selection in the equid lineage we assessed the signatures of selection in the equid lineage using the dn/ds ratio. a consensus horse sequence was constructed by integrating all of the available breed genomes in an attempt to remove breed specificity and to include an asian breed component via the central asian heritage of the marwari. a total of out of genes in the horse reference genome were substituted by the consensus sequences. using the protein sequences of seven non-horse genomes, orthologous gene families were constructed using orthomcl. using alignments of these gene families to estimate dn/ds, we identified genes under selection in the horse genome. the selected genes were particularly enriched in immune response and possible motor ability functions. over evolutionary time, the horse has developed increased speed and its musculature has become specialized for efficient strides. it is therefore possible that the motor activity-associated genes we identified to be under positive selection have contributed to the muscular efficiency seen in modern horses.  our study provides the first whole genome sequences and analyses of the marwari, an asian horse breed. comparing the marwari genome to the horse reference genome, approximately million snvs and million indels, including variants that cause amino acid changes, were identified. we found a clear arabian and mongolian component in the marwari genome, although further work is needed to confirm whether modern marwari horses also descended from indian ponies. we analyzed the marwari variants and found a candidate snv determining its characteristic inward-turning ear tips. additionally, we investigated selection in the horse genome through comparisons with other mammalian genomes. by creating a consensus sequence that included information on an asian breed, we found a number of genetic signatures of selection, providing insights into possible evolutionary and environmental adaptations in the equid lineage. the whole genome sequencing data from the marwari horse provides a rich and diverse genomic resource that can be used to improve our understanding of animal domestication and will likely be useful in future studies of phenotypes and disease. "," the horse is one of the earliest domesticated species and has played an important role in the development of human societies over the past years. in this study, we characterized the genome of the marwari horse, a rare breed with unique phenotypic characteristics, including inwardly turned ear tips. it is thought to have originated from the crossbreeding of local indian ponies with arabian horses beginning in the 12th century.  we generated gb of whole genome sequences from a marwari horse using the illumina hiseq sequencer. the sequences were mapped to the horse reference genome at a mapping rate of ~98% and with ~95% of the genome having at least × coverage. a total of million single nucleotide variations, million small insertions or deletions, and copy number variation blocks were identified. we confirmed a strong arabian and mongolian component in the marwari genome. novel variants from the marwari sequences were annotated, and were found to be enriched in olfactory functions. additionally, we suggest a potential functional genetic variant in the tshz gene associated with the inward-turning ear tip shape of the marwari horses.  here, we present an analysis of the marwari horse genome. this is the first genomic data for an asian breed, and is an invaluable resource for future studies of genetic variation associated with phenotypes and diseases in horses. marwarihorseequus ferus caballuswhole-genome sequencinggenome july- august asia pacific bioinformatics network thirteenth international conference on bioinformatics sydney, australia ",983ef7bf-d663-4af0-ae46-6b87b82e41e6,pubmed
12," hepatitis c virus infects nearly 3% of the world's population and is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. there is no vaccine against hcv and up to recently standard-of-care therapy involved the combined use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. this combination therapy is expensive, effective in only 50%-60% of patients, and can be associated with frequent and serious adverse side effects in >75% of patients. hcv is genetically very heterogeneous and classified into genotypes and numerous subgenotypes. hcv changes continuously during chronic infection, showing a complex dynamics of intra-host viral subpopulations. the most studied hcv region is the hypervariable region located at amino acid positions 384- in the structural protein e sequence variation in hvr correlates with neutralization escape and is associated with viral persistence during chronic infection. recent advances in next-generation sequencing methods allow for analysis of the unprecedented number of hvr sequence variants from infected patients and present a novel opportunity for understanding intra-host hcv evolution, drug resistance and immune escape. hcv hvr variants sampled using ngs from infected individuals were studied here. we report, for the first time, that most variants are organized into large single-mutation connected components. this finding presents a novel framework for genetic analysis of intra-host hcv populations, relevant to the study of viral transmission, immune escape and drug resistance.  one-step networks intra-host variants of the e1/e region were extensively sampled from patients chronically infected with hcv genotypes or after ngs sequencing error correction, the average number of reads and variants obtained from each sample were and, respectively. in all patients, the average frequency of the major variant was. the distance between each pair of variants was calculated and networks were created for each patient, where each node is a variant and two nodes are connected by a link if the nucleotide distance between them is the subsequent research was focused only on large components, which were arbitrarily defined as encompassing >5% of all reads. this threshold was chosen because it defines a small number of large components that still account for most reads found in a patient. in average, a patient had components, ranging from to in each patient; each component having in average variants and a total of reads. network topological analysis all components showed a skewed degree distribution. although not strictly following a power-law degree distribution, most nodes are incident only to one or two links. the shortest path distances among all pairs of sequences were estimated, and then the average shortest path distance for each component was calculated. over all components, the average pairwise distance shortest path was, whereas the diameter was. interestingly, the nodes in the component did cluster very little. a low clustering coefficient indicates the absence of triangles in the network. the only way to form a triangle is to have three sequences that are one mutation away from each other at the same nucleotide position. the absence of this network motif simply indicates that close sequences of this hcv genomic region often differ at distant positions, instead of differing in states of the same position. the component distances highly correlated with the hamming distances between sequences in all patients. when patristic distances were calculated over a neighbor-joining tree for sequences included in each component, the correlation between the original hamming distances and tree-based distances was lower in all cases, with an average of. these results indicate that the distances over the component represented the true distances more accurately than the distances over the tree. in silico sampling robustness the robustness of each component to sampling bias was evaluated by measuring the decline in component connectivity with reduction of the sample size. all components were extraordinarily robust to this type of stochastic sampling; even after randomly removing 85% of all reads, the largest connected component in the new subsample still involved % of the remaining nodes. in vitro reproducibility for of the patients, a second sample which was taken one hour after the first one was available, providing the opportunity to test whether the components found in the first sample were also present in the second sample, an indication of experimental reproducibility. the results showed that % of the components present in the first samples were found in the repeat samples. for these components found in both samples, we calculated the fraction of reads found in the first sample that were also found in the second sample, obtaining an average over all components of %. this result suggests that intra-host subpopulations modelled with components are experimentally stable. all components missing in the second sample had an initial frequency between % and % of all reads, indicating that the 5% arbitrary frequency cut-off chosen in this work for a component to qualify as ""large"" is near the limit of experimental replication. simulated transmission events we simulated unsafe injection-related transmission events using estimates of the number of virions that may establish productive infection of liver from contaminated syringes. in order to simulate the transmission event, a random subsample of only reads was taken from the reads of a given patient. for each recipient sample, we tested the number of components from the source represented by the sampled reads. importantly, we found that % of all simulated transmission events seeded all components present in the source, indicating that viral variants that have established infection in a recipient after transmission likely represent all components existing in the source, thus allowing for the potential reconstitution of these components from a small but heterogeneous founder population. differences among components the components of each patient were well separated, with the average hamming distance between their members being ~ times greater than within each component. for each component, the overall ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes was calculated. most of the patients harboured only negatively selected components, whereas % harboured only positively selected components. however, patients had a mixture of components under negative or positive selection. discussion rna viruses exhibit extremely high mutation rates and given the large population sizes observed in both experimental and natural infections with these viruses, every possible point mutation and many double-mutation combinations could theoretically be generated during each replication cycle within a population. the mutability of each viral genome means that rna virus populations exist as dynamic mutant networks in which sequences are continuously diversified and regenerated by mutation of related sequences, often known as a quasispecies. connecting viral variants that differ in one mutation provides a natural framework to organize the heterogeneous population of viral variants. although this has been achieved on theoretical landscapes, here we have built these one-step networks for the first time using viral experimental data, a development just recently enabled by the ngs technology. analyses conducted using in silico and experimental sampling showed significant robustness of the component to stochastic variation, implying that a true component will not be split into two due to poor sampling. another advantage of the network framework is that several topological parameters can be calculated for a given patient and then used to test for differences among different phenotype groupings. although this topological comparison was not performed in the present research, this network framework provides a new potential tool for comparing viral populations. the simulated transmission events may seem too simplified, as selective pressure in the new host environment will likely be different, affecting intra-host evolution in a different way. however, the simulation does not deal with the survival of those seeds, only with their likelihood of being transmitted. this is in agreement with many reports on hcv outbreaks, where it is very common that newly infected cases share variants and are genetically very close to the transmission source. based on this, the purpose of the simulation was to show a very simple phenomenon: if transmission is purely stochastic, then the variants present in the source will be transmitted to the incident case in proportion to their frequency. as was shown in the transmission simulation experiments, the high frequency of components allows a small random sample of 20- variants to represent with high probability all of these components in each intra-host viral population. this important property facilitates reconstitution of the same component composition of intra-host viral population from the small number of founder variants transmitted from one host to another. the level of genetic separation among large components indicates that exploration of all the components in each infected host likely cannot be accomplished via a single mutation starting from a single viral variant. the existence of several subpopulations organized in one-step components in each infected individual studied here suggests that the founder viral population was complex, in agreement with recent findings. the data obtained in this study indicate that the mechanism of stochastic sampling is compatible with the complex founder model and further experiments are underway to resolve this issue. hcv changes continuously during chronic infection, showing a complex dynamics of intra-host viral subpopulations. large components of hcv variants obtained from follow-up samples could be used to define viral subpopulations, whose shifts in frequency over time can be tracked to pinpoint the sources of drug resistance or immune escape. the one-step connection provides a simple biological criterion for identifying the genetic structure of viral subpopulations. when sampling of intra-host viral variants is done using ngs, the one-step components can be generated for clustering closely related variants without any assumption on their ancestral origin. the genetic space occupied by the variants of a given component will likely be explored very rapidly via single mutations starting from any variant in each component. the estimation of the amount of time needed for this exploration should take into account the kinetic parameters of hcv infection. these are currently being investigated in our laboratory. given that some patients harbour a mixture of positively and negatively selected components, the subpopulations defined by components may experience different selection pressures, accounting for the frequency shifts observed during intra-host evolution in some patients. the distances calculated over the component were found to be almost identical to the hamming distances calculated for all variants, which allows for better visualizing local and global relationships among sequences and among clusters. it must be noted that other popular representations of the distance matrix, such as hierarchical bifurcating trees or multi-dimensional scaling, reduce dimensionality of data at the cost of accuracy of distance representation among genetic variants. we have shown here that patristic distances calculated over the neighbor-joining tree have a significantly lower correlation with the distance matrix than the one-step components. a good phylogenetic tree presents a single most likely history of substitutions, all of which collectively generated the dataset. however, the key point of our work is that a single history is an over-simplification when the whole quasispecies network is continuously generated over multiple parallel paths. this network setting fits better the highly dynamic process which is the result of hcv's large population size, high mutation rate and fast doubling time. although ngs has been instrumental in the acquisition of a massive number of genomic sequences, the contribution of these sequences to understanding intra-host viral evolution have been modest, considering the enormous amount of genetic information generated by the technology. this paradox can, in part, be explained by the shortage of computational methods for verifying the accuracy of generated sequences and accommodating large datasets. however, extensive sequencing of intra-host viral variants offers also novel opportunities for analysing genetic information, which are not available for small samples of sequences. one such approach was developed in this study. we have shown that one-step components represent accurately genetic relationships among the hcv hvr variants extensively sampled by ngs from infected individuals. this likely reflects sampling of numerous intermediates and/or co-existent ancestors, which allows the parsimonious reconstruction of the evolutionary process responsible for generation of the intra-host viral population.  the majority of intra-host hvr variants form large connected components in infected patients. these large components preserve true distances among variants, are well separated from each other, are robust to sampling, and are likely seeded during transmission events. large components identified through ngs-facilitated deep sampling offer a novel evolutionary framework for genetic analysis of intra-host hcv populations to characterise viral factors relevant to transmission, immune escape and drug-resistance. "," next-generation sequencing allows for sampling numerous viral variants from infected patients. this provides a novel opportunity to represent and study the mutational landscape of hepatitis c virus within a single host.  intra-host variants of the hcv e1/e region were extensively sampled from chronically infected patients. after ngs error correction, the average number of reads and variants obtained from each sample were and respectively. the distance between each pair of variants was calculated and networks were created for each patient, where each node is a variant and two nodes are connected by a link if the nucleotide distance between them is the work focused on large components having > 5% of all reads, which in average account for % of all reads found in a patient. the distance between any two variants calculated over the component correlated strongly with nucleotide distances, a better correlation than the one obtained with neighbour-joining trees. in each patient, components were well separated, with the average distance between being times greater than within each component. the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes was calculated and some patients showed a mixture of networks under strong negative and positive selection. all components were robust to in silico stochastic sampling; even after randomly removing 85% of all reads, the largest connected component in the new subsample still involved % of remaining nodes. in vitro sampling showed that % of components present in the original sample were also found in experimental replicas, with % of reads found in both. when syringe-sharing transmission events were simulated, % of all simulated transmission events seeded all components present in the source.  most intra-host variants are organized into distinct single-mutation components that are: well separated from each other, represent genetic distances between viral variants, robust to sampling, reproducible and likely seeded during transmission events. facilitated by ngs, large components offer a novel evolutionary framework for genetic analysis of intra-host viral populations and understanding transmission, immune escape and drug resistance. 12- june third ieee international conference on computational advances in bio and medical sciences new orleans, la, usa ",7afdd3ef-cd44-4f27-831c-cb6fd27f8c02,pubmed
13," postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion formation has long been considered an inevitable consequence of laparotomy, and the incidence in abdominal surgery is ranging between and 93%. adhesion formation is a complex process involving cellular, biochemical, and immunological factors. adhesions can develop when inflammatory responses perturb the equilibrium between fibrin formation and fibrinolysis. the most common symptoms are chronic abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, and secondary female infertility. these complications cause significant morbidity and pose a significant economic burden. many potential preventive agents have been investigated, including intra-abdominal barriers, pharmacological agents, and synthetic devices. at present, physical barriers are considered the most effective treatments for preventing postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion formation. there are various types of commercially available anti-adhesion barriers such as hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membranes and hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose gels these membranes work by preventing contact between damaged surfaces. in recent years, honey has been used for the prevention of postoperative peritoneal adhesions. honey is a heterogeneous substance that inhibits the growth of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, has anti-inflammatory effects, and promotes healing processes following peritoneal damage. because honey has proven effective in preventing intra-abdominal adhesions in liquid form, and since anti-adhesion barriers may be more effective than intraperitoneal solutions, we developed honey-based films that could be used as physical anti-adhesion barriers. by combining some properties of honey such as hygroscopicity, viscosity, and healing effects with the properties of a physical barrier, we hypothesized that an effective means of preventing abdominal adhesions could be developed. mixing honey with a gelling agent resulted in the creation of pectin-honey hydrogels that can be easily applied between damaged organs in the peritoneum. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of phhs for the prevention of intra-abdominal adhesions.  macroscopical examination in rats, no wound site infection or presence of intra-abdominal abscess was observed. presence of adhesions in group c, of animals developed adhesions between the cecum and the peritoneum, while in group t only of did.table presence of adhesions between cecum and peritoneum in group c, animals developed also adhesions between the omentum and linea alba, while in group t only did. the difference in the two groups was not significant. in group c, animal developed adhesion between the apex of cecum and the antimesenteric site of the distal jejunum, in group t animal developed adhesion between the apex of the cecum and the side of a portion of mid-jejunum. in group t animal developed adhesion between the apex of cecum and the median ligament of bladder.table presence of other adhesions adhesions scoring in group c, one rat had an adhesion score of sixteen had a score of and seven had a score of in group t, four rats had adhesion scores of one rat had an adhesion score of and nineteen have score. median adhesion score for group t was, while for group c was. the distribution of scores in the two groups was significantly different.table median of the adhesion scoring histopathological evaluation the histopathological scores of the groups with respect to inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization are shown in table  significantly lower grades of inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization were seen in group t.table median inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization scores inflammation score fibrosis score neovascularization score raw data are reported in an additional file. discussion the phhs developed in this study showed a local anti-adhesive effect that prevented intra-abdominal adherence in a cecal abrasion model in rats. in the control group, of rats developed adhesions between the cecum and peritoneum, while in treatment group only of rats did. the adhesion scores and the extents of adhesions were significant reduced after treatment with phhs without complications related to tissue healing. histopathological scores with respect to inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization were significant lower in the treatment group than those in the control group. many experimental models exist for studying peritoneal adhesions. the cecal abrasion model is a very effective way to create peritoneal adhesions because mechanical intestinal damage activates fibrinolysis and fibrinogenesis, leading to adhesion formation. the cecal abrasion model simulates the clinical situation of the viscera being manipulated to perform surgery. we modified this model by standardizing the number of passages with the gauze on the cecum and by assign animals to c or t group only after having performed the scraping. the first modification was made in order to standardize the damage inflicted to the cecal serosal. the second has been done in order to avoid a possible bias given by knowing in advance the group allocation of the specimen, thus influencing the surgeon toward performing less or more severe lesions. several researchers have used different scoring systems for grading adhesions. many of these studies used swolin’s scoring model, which macroscopically grades adhesions from to according to their severity. we chose to use this method because it is easy to apply and allowed us to express the results clearly. in terms of methods of preventing adhesions, many studies have reported that pharmacological agents are not effective. physical barriers are the most widely used method of adhesion prevention in humans, and have been shown to be effective in preventing intra-abdominal adhesions in animal models. during recent years, many commercially available substances have been used to reduce the occurrence of postoperative adhesions. carboxymethylcellulose bioresorbable membrane is one such material. some studies have demonstrated that a carboxymethylcellulose-based membrane significantly reduces the incidence and extent of adhesions. however, the therapeutic effect of this membrane may be limited to the site of application, and the material seems difficult to handle in clinical practice. in response to the need for effective solutions, honey has become increasingly popular and several studies have been published demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting the peritoneal healing process. however, studies regarding its effects on preventing peritoneal adhesions are still limited. aysan and emre used honey intraperitoneally to reduce postoperative adhesion formation, and reported that the treatment was effective and was associated with no toxic effects. in a preliminary unpublished in vivo test of the pectin-honey hydrogels, we treated three animals with phh produced with 4 g of honey. all the animals died from ascites caused by the osmotic effect of the phh. this fact was not reported by aysan and emre, and could have been caused by the presence of pectin in the films, the low content of water in the phh, or the hygroscopicity of honey. in the second part of the study, we used 2 g of honey for phh construction and none of the animals showed any side effects. this composition of phh reduced inflammation and prevented adhesions formations without causing any side effects. the results of this study demonstrated that phh is effective in preventing the formation of postoperative adhesions. the material can be easily applied by surgeons and can be placed in deep anatomical sites. the phhs are biocompatible and rapidly metabolized in contrast with the carboxymethylcellulose-polylactic acid membranes. we hypothesize that the mechanical barrier combined with the absorption properties of honey may have played a key role in the inhibition of adhesion formation in the present study. more studies are needed on this topic, but the intraperitoneal use of phhs does seem to significantly reduce the occurrence of postoperative adhesions at the site of application. phh are not effective in preventing adhesion at distant sites from application, as demonstrated by the presence of adhesions between other organs other than cecum and peritoneum in treated animals. this is a limit of antiadhesion barriers, that extends to the product we tried in this study. the present study was limited in one key way. we only used one model of adhesion formation, so we cannot be sure if the phhs would behave the same if tested in a range of different models or even in genuine cases. further, using dry gauzes to create the cecal abrasion, could be a confounding factor, because adhesions could be generated by small pieces of gauze lost during the procedures and acting as a foreign body on the surface of the intestine. another important limit is given by the use of a rat model. in fact, many agents that proved effective in rats couldn’t be demonstrated as effective in humans, and basing from this study we cannot predict phh behaving differently.  in conclusion, we observed that damaged cecal and abdominal wall surfaces treated with phhs are significantly less likely to develop postoperative lesions. however, further investigations are needed in order to establish whether these results are transferable to other models and genuine cases, and to establish the true relevance of this treatment modality to the prevention of postoperative adhesions in the peritoneum. "," adhesions are a common postoperative surgical complication. liquid honey has been used intraperitoneally to reduce the incidence of these adhesions. however, solid barriers are considered more effective than liquids in decreasing postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion formation; therefore, a new pectin-honey hydrogel was produced and its effectiveness was evaluated in a rat cecal abrasion model. standardized cecal/peritoneal abrasion was performed through laparotomy in adult sprague-dawley rats to induce peritoneal adhesion formation. rats were randomly assigned to a control and treatment group. in group t, phhs were placed between the injured peritoneum and cecum. animals were euthanized on day after surgery. adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and adhesion scores were recorded and compared between the two groups. inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization were histologically graded and compared between the groups.  in group c, of animals developed adhesions between the cecum and peritoneum, while in group t only of did. in group c, one rat had an adhesion score of sixteen had scores of and seven rats had scores of in group t, four rats had adhesion scores of one rat had an adhesion score of and nineteen have score. significantly lower grades of inflammation, fibrosis, and neovascularization were seen in group t.  phh is a novel absorbable barrier that is effective in preventing intra-abdominal adhesions in a cecal abrasion model in rats. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords honeypectinhydrogeladhesionpreventionratshttp://dx.doi.org/ /501100003407ministero dell’istruzione, dell’università e della ricercaprin 2012gandini marco issue-copyright-statement© the author 2017 ",56a473e6-ea4a-4c97-824a-e176ec64edb0,pubmed
14," the university of california, santa cruz genome database is one of the most common gateways to access genomic sequence and annotation data of humans and other organisms. besides a web-based genome browser, the database is programmatically accessible through three interfaces: the official command-line tools and libraries, the distributed annotation system server, and direct access to a public mysql database server. ucsc’s official tools consist of command-line executables and api libraries written in the c language. the c api widely supports the functionality of the database with good performance. these tools and libraries are available at the kent source tree. the ucsc das server, which supports previous das version, offers a simple interface for programmatic access to the database. however, it has a limitation in supported types of annotations and has disadvantages in its performance. the public mysql server, finally, offers access to almost the same up-to-date database for the genome browser but requires the user to program raw sql statements. given the pervasive use of scripting languages in this field of research, there is a significant demand for simple apis that allow construction of automated queries in these languages. in particular, the ruby programming language has been widely adopted in the bioinformatics domain. libraries including bioruby and the ruby ensembl api have shown the value of database apis for ruby. here, we describe the ruby ucsc api, an api to query the ucsc genome database. implementation object-relational mapping the ruby ucsc api is based on the activerecord framework—a component of ruby on rails —for the object-relational mapping. a database in the ucsc genome database is represented as a module under the bio::ucsc name space and a table in the database is represented as a class under the database module. for example, the “snp132” table in the human genome assembly “hg19” database is referred to as bio::ucsc::hg19::snp query apis to a table are automatically defined from the database schema as class methods following the activerecord’s method naming convention. for example, if the “snp132” table has a field “name”, the snp find_by_name method is readily available. records are instances of the corresponding table class, for which values of any field can be obtained. dynamic class definition the ucsc database is optimized to serve the genome browser, resulting in a very large number of tables for which the api has to provide access. furthermore, these database components are updated frequently. static definitions of many table classes would make api code maintenance difficult. therefore, we employed dynamic class definition in the ruby ucsc api. when a table is referred to for the first time, the api fetches the database schema of that table to determine the data types and then creates an appropriate ruby class for that table. this lazy generation of the classes also contributes to accelerate the initialization of this api when compared to having static classes for thousands of tables. supporting auxiliary flat files a subset of the ucsc genome database, including genome sequences, is not stored in the mysql database but needs to be downloaded locally for access. the ruby ucsc api offers methods to access these downloaded genome sequences. dependencies and environment the ruby ucsc api depends on activerecord and is designed as a bioruby plugin using the biogem system, which organizes rubygems packages and their dependencies for the bioruby library. the ruby ucsc api is written purely in ruby. this increases the compatibility of the api for various operating systems and implementations of the ruby interpreter. the api currently supports different ruby interpreters including ruby version. or later, ruby version. or later, and jruby. or later.  features and usage database connection after loading the ruby ucsc api library, a connection to a database can be established by the ‘connect’ method. while the default connection is made against the ucsc public mysql server, alternative full or partial mirror servers can be used as well. the api can connect to multiple databases simultaneously. table query users can query the database by series of “find” class methods which are dynamically defined for each table class by the activerecord. first of all, find_by_ and find_all_by_ class methods retrieve the first or all matching records, respectively. example queries for the “name” field are shown in line multiple conditions joined by the _and_ operator are also accepted. according to the activerecord’s convention, values of the other fields in a retrieved record can be referred to by using instance methods denoted by the field names. query by genomic intervals a genomic interval can be expressed by a string like “chr1: - ” as used in the graphical web interface of the ucsc genome browser. an interval query condition is passed by the with_interval method. this method automatically absorbs the difference of genomic coordinate conventions between intuitive 1-based coordinates and database internal 0-based coding system. the with_interval method allows retrieving all features that are overlapping with the given interval. instead, the with_interval_excl method only returns features that lie completely within the region and features partially overlapping with the region are excluded. bin indexing system to achieve high query performance for large tables, the ucsc database uses a bin indexing system. in this system, genomic positions in a chromosome are separated into hierarchies of bins that are sized into 512mbase, 64mbase, 8mbase, 1mbase and 128kbase. any annotation in a genomic interval is stored in the minimum sized bin that encompasses the whole interval. for a genomic interval query, if the target table has a “bin” field, the api automatically calculates a list of bins that potentially contain annotations for the interval and applies the list to generate an sql statement to narrow the target record. this is a key feature of the api because multiple queries for genomic intervals without using the bin index take excessive times, especially for large tables such as dbsnp. building sql statements methods to specify search conditions, such as with_interval, select, where, order, limit and group, can be combined by chaining. when a find method or one of the methods to access arrays is called for the condition, the constructed sql query is executed and the results are returned. methods to access information of exons, cdss, and introns instances of “genepred” table classes, such as refgene, ensgene, and knowngene, have exons, cdss, and introns methods. these methods return arrays of bio::genomicinterval objects sorted according to the gene strand. table association the joiner schema file describes the links between the tables of the ucsc genome database. the bio::ucsc::schema::joiner.load class method takes an uri of the schema file. if the uri is not given, ucsc’s all.joiner file is used. the format of the joiner file is documented in the kent source tree. variables in the joiner file can be overwritten. for example, overwriting the gbd variable that stores whole databases can restrict databases used for the link search. the define_association method takes a table class and defines all the associations of given table. unconnected databases and undefined tables are ignored during definition. linked results are always returned as an array. the table association also can be defined manually. when a record in a table can be joined with a record of another table by sharing the same value, the has_one / has_many methods are used to declare the association. once the table association is declared, a table can refer to the associated table using a method of its record object. retrieval of genomic sequences extraction of genomic sequences in the given genomic intervals is a frequent task. the ucsc genome database does not store the genomic sequences in the mysql databases. instead, they provide the sequences as *.2bit files. these files are usually processed by ucsc’s tools written in c. to improve the compatibility, we implemented the same functionalities in ruby. with the bio::ucsc::file::twobit class, *.2bit files are interpreted in ruby and subsequences can be extracted by the subseq method. current limitations the current version of ruby ucsc api uses information of the joiner schema file to find table associations. the all.joiner file, however, describes additional information of including which tables are chromosome- rather than genome-based, field values that have to be transformed to define table associations, and tables with exceptional structures. in future versions, the api will use this information to make user scripts simpler and to follow database structure updates immediately. so far, manual definition of table associations still has an advantage in performance by minimizing table association definitions, especially in some tables that have complicated associations. for some tables including subsets of the encyclopedia of dna elements, the actual data are not stored in the mysql database itself but are stored as references to bigwig, bigbed and bam files. bigwig and bigbed can be accessed by the ucsc tools in c. bam files can be processed by third-party tools such as samtools, and picard. to date, the ruby ucsc api does not support these yet, however, users can use the bio-samtools bioruby plugin for these tasks. existing ucsc apis for scripting languages apis for the ucsc genome database using scripting languages are still limited. for perl, the genoman module offers interfaces to databases including the ucsc genome database. for python, the cruzdb library offers an sqlalchemy-based api for the ucsc genome database. the biggest advantage of ruby ucsc api described here is that ruby and the active record framework enable simplified query and retrieved record description. moreover, the ruby ucsc api does not depend on ucsc’s command-line tools. this makes its installation easier and increases interoperability for various environments including a java-based ruby interpreter, jruby.  ucsc’s official executables and c libraries are the most comprehensive and fastest api for the ucsc genome database; however, apis for scripting languages still have significant advantages for users because their concern is not only a runtime speed but also a total time required for the programming to obtain the results. the ruby ucsc api offers effective productivity and can therefore have a significant impact in the field. the ruby ucsc api already supports all organisms in the ucsc genome database. in future releases, more comprehensive supports for new organisms and older or updated genome assemblies will be added. the ruby ucsc api is freely available as a rubygem package. source code and documentations are also available at https://github.com/misshie/bioruby-ucsc-api/. documentation and feedback are available at the userecho site at

15," sunflower, 2n = belongs to family asteraceae, with an estimated genome size of mbp, and is the fourth most important oilseed crop. it is a native of north america and widely cultivated in the world with an annual production of about million tonnes. the genome size of this crop is large compared to model species like arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, soybean or tomato. the major drivers of this large genome size are mainly the recent polyploidization event and the important amplification of transposable elements. many wild sunflower species are increasingly used for improvement of cultivated varieties by conventional breeding. with continued biased selection of the cultivated sunflower for traits such as yield, many alleles conferring useful traits got lost. therefore a method to create variability for breeding this crop, in this era of increasing global food crisis and changing climatic regimes, is highly desirable. for many decades, plant breeders have concentrated their efforts on improvement of sunflower through traditional breeding and recently, molecular mapping has been successfully undertaken for marker assisted breeding. furthermore, chemical mutagenesis has been used by breeders to create variability in crops including sunflower but these have been mostly restricted to dominant traits. therefore, many desirable mutations that are recessive have been missed during selection. finally, traits such as oil quality cannot be selected by visual inspection of plants. sunflower is one of the major oil seed crops grown all over the world and considerable research efforts have been put to understand lipids biosynthesis and modification. this research mainly focused on the production of more stable sunflower oils for biolubrication and the increase of healthy substitutes for food industry. the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in plant storage tissues is an intraplastidial process in which the multienzyme fatty acid synthase complex catalyses a series of enzymatic reactions. in sunflower, the main products of intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis are, first, palmitoyl-acp, which is further elongated by the fas ii complex to produce stearoyl-acp. in turn, this molecule is the substrate for stearoyl-acp desaturase that introduces a double bond in the carbon chain to produce oleoyl-acp. all of these products can be exported from the plastid after the hydrolysis between the acyl molecule and acp by the acyl-acp thioesterase. two types of acyl-acps thioesterases have been identified in higher plants such as sunflowers: fata and fatb. fata thioesterases preferentially act on long chain fatty acids, and have particularly high specificity for 18:1-acp and a lower affinity for 16:0-acp and 18:0-acp. to address the needs of the confectionery industry for saturated fatty acids, high stearic acid content oils have been developed mainly by genetic modification of the fata stearoyl-acp thioesterase and the sad stearoyl-acp desaturase. stearic fatty acid is considered cardiovascular neutral and do not modify the plasmatic cholesterol levels in humans. tilling is a technology to detect induced and natural polymorphisms in plants. the critical steps in tilling procedure include the purity of seed material, the quality of the mutagenesis and the size of the mutant collection. tilling relies on the ability of a group of enzymes, the endonucleases, to detect mismatches in a specific gene. with the introduction of high throughput tilling technology, detection of even rare recessive mutation is possible. the significant advantages of tilling method in creating and discovering new traits is that it significantly costs less for product development compared to transgenic crop plants. this makes it an attractive tool for crop improvement. as sequencing technology is getting advanced, deciphering small changes, like snps, which plays an important role in adaptive response and evolution of species is possible. sunflower, cultivated as a source of vegetable oil and protein is an attractive model for investigating seed oil quality. to investigate such trait, we have developed a reference ems mutant population under controlled conditions and established a tilling platform. as proof-of-concept, we screened for mutations in two genes, fata and sad, involved in accumulation of short to medium chain fatty acids and identified induced mutations.  ems mutagenesis a relatively large tilling resource comprising  m families was developed for sunflower crop improvement using variety bbs- to find the optimum dose of ems that produce a maximum mutation density without causing extensive sterility and lethality; a ‘kill curve’ analysis was conducted on batches of seeds treated with different ems doses, form 0% to 3%, during 8 hours. at % and % ems, seed germination rate was 54% and 50%, respectively. drastic plant lethality was observed for seeds treated with an ems dose greater than 1% and total lethality was observed at 3% ems. finally, % ems treatment during 8 hours, corresponding to the ld was retained and tested on large batches of seeds. a total of seeds were mutagenised and sown in pots to raise the nursery for creating the tilling sunflower genetic resource. about  m plants were obtained, showing 50% lethality at seedling stage. after transplanting, further mortality occurred and a total of  m plants produced seeds, among which  m plants produced a good seed set. m seeds were harvested from the individual m plants. in total,  m seed stocks were harvested and corresponding m seeds were produced. m plant phenotyping ten seeds per m family were sown in pots to raise the nursery and to screen for visual developmental phenotypes. after 4 weeks, plants were transferred to the fields and about 95% of the m plants were recovered. the phenotypic scoring was based on the observation of each plant, using the untreated sunflower phenotype as a reference. the phenotypic screen included dwarfism, plant height, flowering pattern, the leaf architecture and sterility. the data collected are shown in table  photographs were taken at regular intervals for record purposes. a range of phenotype was observed and some are described below. compared to the untreated sunflower, and plants showed dwarf and tall phenotype, respectively. some of these dwarf plants can be used in creating hybrids with enhanced yield and dwarf stature. for the flower phenotype, we identified plants with large flower heads, plants with twin flowers, plants with fused and/or closed flower and plants with upright flower. three plants harbored variation in flower color, plant produced small seeds and plants were sterile as both disc and ray florets were missing. in total 57 m plants, representing % of the population, showed at least one altered trait. mutation discovery by tilling screening for mutations in the two genes, fata and sad, was used as proof-of-concept to determine the quality of the sunflower mutant collection and to estimate the mutation density. both of these genes control production of short to medium chain fatty acids. sad controls the production of stearic acid over oleic acid and inhibition of this enzyme leads to an increase stearic acid synthesis and a reduction of oleic acid production. there are two isoforms of acyl-acp thioesterase, fata and fatb which dictate the length of medium chain fatty acids production. fata controlling essential role in chain termination of fatty acid synthesized was used in the present study. we screened for mutations in the whole exonic and promoter regions of fata and sad genes. mutations were detected in the amplified targets using the mismatch-specific endonuclease endo as previously described. tilling of fata yielded independent point mutations, which correspond to silent, missense, stop codon and promoter region mutations. tilling of sad yielded independent point mutations, which correspond to silent and missense mutations. all the identified mutations were confirmed by sequencing and, as expected for ems mutagenesis, single nucleotide substitutions were identified both in coding and non-coding regions and classical ems mutations g to a and c to t were induced. the mutation frequency for each amplicon is calculated as follows: /. the average mutation frequency was estimated to be one mutation per 480 kb. we calculated the mutation frequency in the fata and sad genes according to dalmais et al.. we estimated the smart average mutation density to one mutation every 480 kb. this mutation rate is similar to those reported in the other diploid crops. the large number of mutations identified in the tilling screens, i.e. independent mutations, confirms that the genetic resource developed is of high quality. background mutations in the interesting mutant line can be removed by backcrossing with the parental non-mutated line and cleaned lines can be released after trials as a variety. as the mutation is known, the released varieties can be followed in the field by marker assisted selection. mutations resulting in stop codon and in splicing junction of exon-intron boundary are of great potential as found in the present study. currently bioinformatic tools are available to predict the severity of the non-synomonous mutations. synonymous substitutions have the potential to alter the production and function of a protein through folding changes, although the exact mechanism and frequency of such event is still a mystery. discussion as the world population continues to grow at a rapid pace, crop varieties with novel traits such as improved growth and yield potential are needed to feed in the future. plant breeding is an old science which played a significant role during green revolution for its contribution in increasing crop yields. at present, there is skepticism against growing transgenic crops and transgenic technology, mainly because of the high cost incurred in creating a variety due to lengthy regulatory hurdles, which is almost absent with mutation breeding. tilling provides a way to overcome problems associated with other techniques used in plant improvement like rnai, over expression of genes, antisense technique, site directed mutagenesis by zinc fingers, t-dna knockouts and transposon tagging. many useful alleles involved in qualitative and quantitative parameters that exist in natural crop populations have been eliminated in the numerous rounds of selection for targeted traits. therefore, creation of novel genetic resource by mutagenesis is a useful tool in crop improvement. in this study, we present a sunflower tilling genetic resource produced by ems chemical mutagenesis. to set up the sunflower tilling platform, we developed an ems mutant collection under controlled condition. the  m mutant collection was phenotyped and genomic dna was prepared from the mutant plants and organized in pools for bulked screens. the mutant collection phenotyping showed that % of the mutant plant present at least on altered trait and confirm the quality of the mutagenesis. the sunflower mutant collection could be used for both forward and reverse genetics. sunflower has not been sequenced until now, owing to its large genome size. however, ests are available at ncbi as of today. studies by chapman et al. conducted genome scan in cultivated sunflower to predict genes involved in evolution of modern day cultivated variety. lai et al. published snps identified from submitted est information in gene banks. therefore, comparative genomic analysis can successfully be performed to pinpoint key gene information relating to various traits in this species by comparing known genetic information from other sequenced species. to validate the quality of mutagenised population, we screened for mutants in fata and sad genes involved in oil biosynthesis. many other published reports are available today pertaining to changes in seed oil composition in crop varieties. for example, mutations induced in the gene encoding Δ fatty acid desaturase. screening for fad variants which increase oleic acid has been confirmed in soybean and novel fad alleles have been pursued in peanut and sunflower. in the smart mutant population, the mutation frequency was estimated to be 1/480 kb similar to the recently published reports in sunflower and other crops. chemical mutagenesis and tilling approach together can be used to develop plants not only for the purpose of increasing productivity and quality parameters, but also in phytoremediation. tilling has been successfully used in many crops to obtain useful alleles such as long shelf-life in melon and tomato, improved starch quality in potato, virus resistance in tomato and pepper. a number of crops are being sequenced at present, sequence information of more than crops are available now and more than hundred crop plants are being sequenced. many key value-added traits can be obtained in sunflower with candidate gene polymorphism.  a tilling genomic resource was developed for cultivated sunflower. novel mutants having useful mutation in genes can be found by screening the population through high throughput adp technique as mentioned in this article. results obtained by screening two proof-of-concept genes are highly promising and confirms that the population is well mutagenized. additional candidate genes can be screened from the resource developed. such approach can also be used to develop markers for mas strategy in sunflower breeding programs. "," sunflower is an important oilseed crop grown widely in various areas of the world. classical genetic studies have been extensively undertaken for the improvement of this particular oilseed crop. pertaining to this endeavor, we developed a “chemically induced mutated genetic resource for detecting snp by tilling” in sunflower to create new traits.  to optimize the ems mutagenesis, we first conducted a “kill curve” analysis with a range of ems dose from % to 3%. based on the observed germination rate, a 50% survival rate i.e. ld treatment with % ems for 8 hours was chosen to generate  m populations, out of which,  m plants with fertile seed set. phenotypic characterization of the  m mutagenised lines were undertaken to assess the mutagenesis quality and to identify traits of interest. in the m population, about % of the plants showed phenotypic variations. the sunflower tilling platform was setup using endo-1-nuclease as mismatch detection system coupled with an eight fold dna pooling strategy. as proof-of-concept, we screened the m population for induced mutations in two genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, fata an acyl-acp thioesterase and sad the stearoyl-acp desaturase and identified a total of mutations.  based on the tilling of fata and sad genes, we calculated the overall mutation rate to one mutation every 480 kb, similar to other report for this crop so far. as sunflower is a plant model for seed oil biosynthesis, we anticipate that the developed genetic resource will be a useful tool to identify novel traits for sunflower crop improvement. sunflowertillingfunctional genomicsoil qualityfatty acidscrop improvement ",a37e379f-88cc-45f8-b456-39b3f12be762,pubmed
16," the renin-angiotensin system is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and extracellular volume in the body. the ras sequentially processes angiotensinogen to angiotensin ii, a peptide hormone that is a potent vasoconstrictor. inhibition of ras components has been used successfully in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure and end organ damage. renin catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the ras cascade and renin is specific for angiotensinogen. blockade of ang ii production by direct inhibition of renin has long been a therapeutic goal. early renin inhibitors, such as enalkiren and remikiren, were effective in blood pressure lowering. however, due to poor oral bioavailability, duration of action, and high costs of synthesis, these early peptidomimetic inhibitors never progressed to pivotal clinical studies. continued clinical interest in renin has led to the recent approval of the first renin inhibitor, aliskiren, a non-peptidic inhibitor of renin, which has generated an interest in finding newer renin inhibitors with improved profiles. renin is a member of the aspartic acid protease family. the human renin gene encodes for a protein consisting of amino acids. it is proteolytically processed and secreted as a residue zymogen, prorenin, which contains a amino acid propeptide. the propeptide serves as an autoinhibitory domain that controls the enzyme activity. the pro segment must be removed to generate mature, fully active renin. prorenin is synthesized principally by juxtaglomerular cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole of the kidney and is released into the bloodstream. renin was first purified from animal tissues, including submaxillary glands and kidneys. yields were generally very low. for instance, yokosawa et al obtained only μg of pure renin from kg of non-cancerous autopsied human kidneys. using recombinant techniques, renin has been expressed and purified from eukaryotic cell lines including cho cells, mouse l- cells, sf insect cells and damp cells. active renin had also been over-expressed in escherichia coli and successfully refolded. in order to supply enzyme to support our structure-based design efforts, we developed an efficient system for renin production and purification in amounts sufficient to support routine x-ray crystallography. herein, we report a simple procedure for renin expression and purification that exploits the affinity of glycosylated renin for con a. generally, multi-milligram quantities of material can be prepared from the conditioned medium of hek cell culture. the active renin protein prepared has been used successfully to support activity assays and to generate high resolution crystal complexes with bound inhibitors.  the recombinant human renin gene was transfected into the human kidney cell line, hek- a clonal cell line expressing significant levels of prorenin was prepared by limiting dilution. analysis of the conditioned media of multiple clones identified a single clone that was scaled and transferred to growth in a hollow fiber bioreactor. this line was subsequently adapted to growth in serum free media. the recombinant human prorenin was constitutively secreted into the medium with concomitant removal of the aminoacid long n-terminal signal peptide. although serum-free medium was used to grow the cells, the small amounts of other proteins were found as contaminants. prorenin has two n-linked glycosylation sites and. the glycosylated prorenin has reasonable affinity for con a and this interaction was used to purify the protein to high purity in a single step. to our surprise, the major contaminating protein, bsa, did not bind to the con a resin. the bovine serum had been used in the culture medium initially when the cell line was adapted to the serum-free medium and bsa was a major component. therefore, the con a chromatography is more like a step of prorenin enrichment and any major contaminants were removed subsequently with cation exchange chromatography. after the hollow fiber bioreactor system was set up for the prorenin expression, the conditioned medium was collected, about ml a day, which was pooled and loaded onto the con a column. for one typical manageable purification experiment, 250– ml containing approximately mg proteins was used. the column was washed until the baseline was stabilized. in order to improve the yields, the column was ""soaked and then eluted"" with the buffer containing d-methyl-mannopyranoside at the low flow rate. usually, two or three cycles of the soaking/eluting were applied in order to maximize the recovery. the volume of the pooled materials containing mainly prorenin was reduced to approximately ml by the millipore ultrafiltration device, followed by activation and further purification. no other detectable endogenous con a binding proteins were observed by coomasie stained sds-page gels. the con a material was converted to active renin by digestion with trypsin. trypsin cleaves after residue arg conditions were optimized using different temperature, time and amounts of trypsin. the final conditions were described in the experimental section and provide mild proteolysis for quantitative conversion of prorenin to active renin. prolonged trypsin treatment did not appear to result in any internal cleavage of the protein, and generally one hour incubation at 4°c with trypsin afforded a complete conversion from prorenin to renin indicating that the propeptide trypsin-cleavage site was accessible. after digestion, trypsin was removed with trypsin-inhibitor agarose beads. any other contaminants or misfolded renin proteins were removed with cation exchange chromatography. approximately 60–70% of the total proteins were removed at this step. the final step of purification involved with a size exclusion column, resulting in a purified activated renin of >98% purity, as estimated by the reducing sds-page analysis. the conversion of prorenin to renin by trypsin results in removal of amino acids, approximately kda. because of heterogeneous nature of glycosylation, prorenin and renin migrated on the sds-page gel as broad bands of around kda and kda, respectively. the proteins were analyzed by the n-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry for further characterization of the proteolytic activation. the n-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that the first residues of the mature renin were ltlgxt and verified the complete removal of the propeptide. the x represents the asparagine residue which is a glycosylation site. mass spectrometry analysis indicated that glycosylation of renin added from to kda to the molecular weight, based on the calculated dna-deduced amino acid sequence. the discrepancy of molecular weights might be related to variations in growth conditions and reagents from batch to batch because of the heterogeneous nature of glycosylation. the sugar moieties were removable by endoglycosidase h treatment only in partially denatured proteins under conditions of 1% sds at 37°c overnight. in our crystallization studies and biological assays, the sugar moieties were not removed. typically, 1– mg of protein could be obtained from one batch of purification using approximately – ml starting conditioned medium, depending on cell well-being, growth conditions and other procedural irregularities. *the representative major molecular weight peak from several batch of samples. the activated renin was characterized in a functional assay. the catalytic activity was measured using the commercially available substrate, dabcyl-γabu-ile-his-pro-phe-his-leu-val-ile-his-thr-edans, which is based on the angiotensinogen sequence. velocity of reaction was initially followed by hplc and exhibited hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration consistent with michaelis-menten kinetics with an apparent km of μm. this value is similar to the km of μm reported in the literature based on the fret assay. the catalytic efficiency of recombinant rennin was determined using the dabcyl-edans substrate. the enzyme had a second order rate constant of × m-1s- this value is close to the published catalytic efficiency of × m-1s- and × m-1s- for the cleavage of angiotensinogen tetradecapeptide by purified human renin. enzymatic activity of the recombinant human renin was measured in a ph-rate profile. activity was measured between ph and in ph units. the maximum activity was observed at ph, similar to purified human renin. the peak and the shoulder of the ph profile were similar to those observed for purified human renin cleaving partially purified human angiotensinogen with the maxima at ~ and. several well characterized inhibitors of human renin were tested with the recombinant enzyme. these inhibitors included commercially available statines and the small molecule inhibitor aliskiren. pepstatin a is a potent inhibitor of several aspartic proteases including cathepsin e, cathepsin d and hiv protease. human renin is poorly inhibited by pepstatin a, while porcine renin exhibits sub-micromolar inhibition constants with this compound. the recombinant human renin was inhibited by pepstatin a with an ic of ± μm, similar to literature values. sr is a pepstatin analog that inhibits human plasma renin activity with the ic of nm. the compound is potent against purified recombinant human renin with an ic of ± nm the recombinant renin was also inhibited by aliskiren, a potent human renin inhibitor currently marketed for hypertension as tekturna. aliskiren is selective for human renin with a reported ic of nm. in our hands, ic value for recombinant human renin was ± nm. the recombinant renin is indistinguishable from renin purified from human sources and stable after long term storage at -80°c. the material is suitable for functional assays and x-ray crystallography. the material had been used to generate > renin inhibitor complexes ranging from Å– Å resolution. a typical experiment is shown with vtp. vtp is a weak inhibitor of ic nm. co-crystals of this compound were obtained by the hanging drop method. these crystals diffracted at Å. this complex can be used for soaking studies with potent inhibitors, which readily displace vtp generating high quality crystals. details on the structural solutions of vtp and additional structures will be reported separately.  this present work describes a simple, efficient method for the production and purification of active human renin. recombinant renin can be generated in milligram quantities via a simple activation/purification sequence. biochemical properties of the recombinant human renin are indistinguishable from those reported in the literature for purified enzyme. renin inhibitors were active against the recombinant enzyme with potencies very similar to the inhibition constants measured for purified human renin. the material is highly pure and is suitable for supporting activity assays and structural biology efforts. "," the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system cascade is a major target for the clinical management of hypertension. although inhibitors of various components of this cascade have been developed successfully, development of renin inhibitors has proven to be problematic. the development of these inhibitors has been hindered by poor bioavailability and complex synthesis. however, despite the challenges of designing renin inhibitors, the enzyme remains a promising target for the development of novel treatments for hypertension. x-ray crystallographic data could greatly assist the design and development of these inhibitors. here we describe the purification and characterization of recombinant human renin for x-ray crystallization studies.  a cdna encoding the full length of native human preprorenin was introduced into the hek- cell line. a clonal cell line expressing prorenin was generated and grown under serum free conditions in a hollow fiber bioreactor. prorenin was constitutively secreted and purified directly from the conditioned medium. concanavalin a chromatography effectively enriched and purified prorenin to 90% homogeneity in a single step. prorenin was converted to active renin by trypsin digestion to remove the propeptide. active renin was further purified using a cation exchange column followed by a gel filtration column. biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme showed both binding and catalytic properties were essentially identical to previously reported activities for purified renin. crystals were grown using this material in our x-ray structure studies, and high resolution diffraction was obtained.  this present work describes a simple and efficient method for the generation and purification of active human renin. the protein is highly pure and is suitable for supporting structural biology efforts.

17," anacystis nidulans is a rod-shaped, unicellular prokaryotic cyanobacterium and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary producer. it is often used as an indicator for studying the toxic metabolic levels of heavy metals. many heavy metal studies have been done using a. nidulans as the model system for the reaction of organisms to heavy metal stresses. in freshwater environments, dense algal blooms of cyanobacteria are usually caused by nutrient enrichment from sewage, agricultural fertilizers and industrial run-off into waterways. algal blooms are considered threat to the water system. cyanophage are viruses that infect cyanobacteria and are ubiquitous in both freshwater and marine environments. these phages play important roles in modulating cyanobacterial populations, affecting primary productivity, increasing water quality and may have a profound influence on global biogeochemical cycles. although the interaction between a cyanophage and its host organism is important in maintaining water quality in freshwater systems, little is known about how viruses regulate microbial mortality in natural waters. recently, it was found that lysogenic infection was common in marine synechococcus sp.. cyanophage infecting a single strain of marine synechococcus sp. can reach to per ml in seawater. suttle and chan have estimated that between 5– % of marine synechococcus cells were lysed by cyanophage daily. the discovery of a high abundance of viral particles in natural waters initiated the research on the ecological impact of the viral infection and lysis of marine microbes. they also provided evidence that viruses can affect microbial populations by either going through a lytic cycle, causing destruction of the host cell, or maintaining a lysogenic stage, in which the viral genome is inserted and maintained as the prophage in its host cell. there was also evidence to suggest that seasonal changes can cause the prophage to enter a lytic cycle thus leading to the disappearance of algae blooms. lysogeny can also be induced to a lytic cycle by pollutants. although extensive research has been done on the interaction between cyanophage and cyanbacteria in marine systems, there are no significant reports that have focused on freshwater cyanophage/cyanobacteria interactions. the possibility of temperate as- and lysogenic a. nidulans was suggested by bisen et al, but there was no direct evidence provided. it has been reported that uv, mitomycin c and heavy metals such as copper, cadmium can induce the release of cyanophage in marine water. in this study, different concentrations of copper sulfate were used to study a possible as- lysogenic life cycle in addition to the previously characterized lytic cycle. addition of copper sulfate led to a significant increase in phage production, a characteristic of an organism with a lysogenic life cycle. the study of lytic induction from temperate a. nidulans can provide a good model for studying the interaction between cyanophage and cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems.  in order to determine if heavy metals could cause induction of as- from temperate a. nidulans, cuso was added at concentrations of × 10- m, × 10- m, × 10- m and × 10- m at day post innoculation, the exponential growth stage of the culture. growth of an-t was severely inhibited at concentrations of × 10- m and × 10- m. growth was affected to a certain extent in × 10- m of cuso4; growth rate in × 10- m cuso was very similar to the control. as results seen in marine cyanobacteria, there is consistent release of virus through out the lysogenic cycle in the normal as-1/a. nidulans infective system. the viral release was monitored by plaque forming units. the representative pictures of the plaque forming units after cuso induction were obtained from different treated conditions and illustrated as no plaques and the proper number of plaques as showed in figure the results of as- pfu study, showed that hours after copper induction, ± pfus were observed from the control, ± pfus were observed from × 10- m of cuso4;

"," it has been reported that some marine cyanophage are temperate and can be induced from a lysogenic phase to a lytic phase by different agents such as heavy metals. however, to date no significant reports have focused on the temperate nature of freshwater cyanophage/cyanobacteria. previous experiments with cyanophage as- and cyanobacteria anacystis nidulans have provided some evidence that as- may have a lysogenic life cycle in addition to the characterized lytic cycle.  in this study, the possible temperate a. nidulans was treated with different concentrations of heavy metal-copper. cuso with concentrations of × 10- m, × 10- m, × 10- m and × 10- m were used to detect the induction of as- from a. nidulans. the population of the host, unicellular cyanobacteria anacystis nidulans, was monitored by direct count and turbidity while the amount of virus produced was derived from plaque forming units by a direct plating method. the ratio of as- release from a. nidulans was also determined. from these results it appears that as- lysogenic phage can be induced by copper at concentrations from × 10- m to × 10- m. maximal phage induction occurred at hours after addition of copper, with an optimal concentration of × 10- m.  cu2+ is a significant inducer for lysogenic cyanobacterial cells and consequently would be a potential control agent in the cyanobacteria population in fresh water ecosystems.

18," tropheryma whipplei, the agent of the whipple's disease, has been recently isolated and cultured and is classified within the actinomycetes clade. on the basis of sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene, several diagnostic pcr assays targeting various parts of this gene have been reported and pcr has become an important diagnostic tool. one of the important limits of pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene is its specificity. indeed, positive pcr results have been found in specimens from people without the classic clinical or histological features of wd. in one series, t. whipplei dna was apparently detected in out of waste-water samples obtained from five different sewage treatment plants in southwest germany, and in % of either duodenal biopsies specimens or gastric juice specimens from patients with no clinical signs of wd. similarly, in a random sample of healthy people, street et al. found that 35% had t. whipplei dna detected in their saliva. dutly et al. have also reported the presence of t. whipplei dna in saliva of healthy people. all these data were obtained using primers targeting a part of the 16s rrna gene. in contrast, using specific primers of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna intergenic spacer and primers targeting a 650-bp fragment of the β-subunit of the rna polymerase gene, saliva specimens from people without suspicion of wd failed to yield a significant pcr product signal. maiwald et al. also reported that t. whipplei occurs only rarely in intestinal mucosa that lacks histopathologic evidence of wd. these conflicting and confusing data emphasize the need for additional information on the prevalence of t. whipplei in healthy people, especially in saliva. for this purpose we have compared in this study the use of specific target genes repeated sequences present in seven copies in the genome of t. whipplei in a real-time pcr with taqman* probes, with the previously published primers targeting the 16s rrna gene in saliva from healthy people.  the sensitivity of our real-time pcr assay was of dna copy of standard control dna. specificity was verified using dna extracted from bacterial strains as previously described; none of the dna yield a positive signal for the two sets of primers and probes. although the lightcycler pcr results with both primer pairs and probes were negative for all the saliva, and out of samples were positive with the primers used by dutly et al. and ramzan et al. and from street et al, respectively. among the positive samples using the primers of dutly et al., yielded a bp sequence that was % identical to that of actinomyces odontolyticus and yielded a bp that was % identical to that of actinomyces turicensis. the sequences obtained using the primers from street et al. yielded a bp sequence that was % identical to that of capnocytophaga gingivalis. the 16s rrna sequences of the two available genomes of t. whipplei were retrieved from the kegg website and were used for sequence alignments using the clustalw software with our two original sequences of a. odontolyticus and c. gingivalis. the c. gingivalis 16s rrna sequence shares % homology and the a. odontolyticus 16s rrna sequence shares % homology with the corresponding 16s rrna sequences of the t. whipplei genomes. discussion in this study, using the same pcr protocols previously used for the detection of t. whipplei, the sequences obtained with primers of the 16s rrna gene were in all cases false positive pcr results with sequences similar to that of bacteria of the oral cavity and not with t. whipplei. a better sensitivity and specificity using repeated sequences instead of the 16s rrna gene has also been reported in other bacteria such as coxiella burnetii. thus we believe that such high prevalence of t. whipplei dna described in the saliva of healthy people reported using less specific pcr-based methods targeting the 16s rrna gene are likely due to false positive amplifications of bacteria of the oral cavity. therefore positive pcr results using the 16s rrna gene should be interpreted cautiously and sequencing should be the rule. for example, in the study of street et al., only positive pcr products of patients were sequenced yielding a 100% homology with the 16s rrna sequence of t. whipplei. since the remaining positive samples were not sequenced it is possible that other bacteria found in the oral cavity such as actinomyces spp. or c. gingivalis were the cause of the false positive results. this is particularly important when comparing the sequences in our study with the 16s rrna sequences of t. whipplei with a high percentage of homology of the sequences, especially at both the 5' and 3' ends. since we have started to perform the diagnosis of wd in our laboratory, t. whipplei dna has been demonstrated using our pcr assays in saliva from out of patients without wd. zinkernagel et al have demonstrated that the subgingival plaque may serve as a natural habitat of t. whipplei. in this study, using a real-time quantitative pcr assay, authors found also that all samples from saliva were negative.  asymptomatic carriers of t. whipplei in saliva may exist but their prevalence is much lower than those previously reported. testing the specificity of designed primers is critical to avoid false positive detection of t. whipplei. in atypical case we recommend to test two different specific target genes before concluding.

19," the brown hare is widely distributed throughout europe, up to 60°n, in asia minor and probably south to israel. it is a popular game animal and its range has expanded to the east both by natural dispersion and by translocations to central and far-east siberia. worldwide it has also been imported to many other countries, outside its natural distribution range, e.g. south and north america, australia and new zealand. the brown hare is common all over denmark and is the only lepus species that exists in the country. since the hare population has declined drastically in europe and in denmark. the primary cause of the decline is habitat changes in relation to agricultural intensification, whereas effects of climatic changes and predator abundance have increased by loss of year-round access to high-quality food and cover. additional factors like predators, birds of prey and traffic may have influenced the population locally. in denmark this is reflected by a large drop in annual number of hares shot from more than before to in 2004/. the general range of the mountain hare covers much of the palaearctic. in europe it exists in great britain, norway, sweden, finland, parts of the alps and in eastern europe but it does not exist in denmark. during the late nineteenth century the brown hare was introduced in southern sweden as a game animal. in scandinavia the mountain hare populations have been retreating northwards since the introduction of the brown hare, presumably as a result of a gradual competitive exclusion by the latter. mountain hares supposedly colonized scandinavia through repeated immigration waves over two different post-glacial colonization routes; one from the south and one from the northeast. given the sympatric distribution of several hare species, e.g. in sweden, italy, and spain, a number of studies focused on the possibility of interspecific hybridization. the first evidence of interspecific hybridization in hares concerns l. timidus and l. europaeus in sweden where unidirectional introgression of the native l. timidus mtdna occurs in the introduced l. europaeus. however, introgression of mitochondrial dna into other hare species has been demonstrated, e.g. the introgression of l. timidus mtdna into l. granatensis, l. europaeus and l. castroviejoi in northern iberia and introgression of foreign mtdna is likely to occur in several hare species from asia. these findings have lead to the conclusion that the genetic integrity of many european species largely depends on differences in behaviour and ecology which, at best, offer semi-permeable isolation. in captivity, mountain hare females mate with brown hare males and produce viable offspring, whereas the reverse crosses do not happen spontaneously but can be performed successfully with insemination. the f hybrids are morphological intermediates between the two species. during the data analysis in a study concerning danish brown hares we identified hares with a very divergent haplotype. here we show that these individuals from the danish wild brown hare populations carry mountain hare mtdna haplotypes.  during alignment of hare sequences, sequences were clearly different from the rest and collapsed into a single haplotype. the individuals were obtained from five of the eight populations sampled, and these five populations are all located on islands in the eastern part of denmark. the frequency of sampled individuals with l. timidus mtdna in those five populations averaged 6%. a blast search against genbank with the divergent haplotype mtdna returned l. timidus as the best hit, but not a single l. europaeus sequence in the first hits. the subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that the divergent danish haplotype is grouped with l. timidus samples from across europe and most closely related to the swedish l. timidus haplotypes. the other danish haplotypes included in the phylogenetic analysis, the l. europaeus haplotypes, are grouped with the l. europaeus clade as expected, and they are most closely related to german haplotypes. hence, the danish haplotypes clearly originate from two different species. discussion the results show the presence of mountain hare mtdna in danish brown hare populations. from mtdna alone we cannot decide whether these individuals are true mountain hares or introgressed brown hares. this would require further analysis using nuclear gene sequences. however, given a) the frequency of the l. timidus haplotype where it is present, b) that l. timidus is not reported to be a native breeding species in denmark, and c) that the two species are able to hybridize, these individuals most likely represent introgressed brown hares. the most likely origins of introgression are; 1) natural migration of mountain hares from sweden followed by introgression, or 2) natural migration or translocation of introgressed brown hares from sweden. however, since the documented distribution of mountain hares in sweden does not include southern sweden, natural migration of mountain hares is less probable than introduction of introgressed brown hares from sweden. the fact that the baltic sea occasionally freezes over in very severe winters facilitates natural migration of introgressed brown hares from southern sweden across the sea barrier to the eastern danish islands. this is also supported by the results from the genetic analyses. during the mid 1980'ies a network of hare breeding facilities was established in denmark, and it was initiated with imported hares primarily from italy, france, hungary and sweden. no combined record is kept of the amount and origin of hares imported to denmark. in when farming hares were prohibited in denmark, there were hare-farms in denmark, with an annual export of up to hares. as approximately 15% of swedish l. europaeus specimens from sympatric areas carried transmitted l. timidus mtdna, it is possible that phenotypic brown hare specimens imported from sweden for breeding purposes have carried the l. timidus mtdna and later escaped to the natural hare population. the detection of only one haplotype in the individuals shows low mtdna diversity in the total population of hybrids in denmark. the geographical distribution of the intogressed brown hares and the lack of haplotype diversity support a common origin in southern sweden. the implications of introgressed brown hares in the danish hare populations are currently unclear. it has been suggested that hares with an alien mtdna have a lowered fitness as a result of a functional incompatibility between the cytoplasmatic mitochondrial genes and the cell nucleus. in opposition to this, due to its observed high frequency in brown hares melo-ferreira et al. suggested, that the ancient l. timidus mtdna observed in the iberian peninsular might have some selective advantage depending on the nuclear background. thulin et al. raised the question as to whether any'pure' population of brown hares exists anywhere. our findings give further support to this statement. this has important consequences for conservation and population genetics, e.g. problematic definition of management units, unclear fitness effects, genetically mixed populations and the inclusion of nuclear markers will be necessary for future hare studies.  contrary to what is known, the danish hare populations are not pure l. europaeus populations but include introgressed brown hares with swedish l. timidus mtdna. the most probable explanation is natural migration or translocation of introgressed brown hares from sweden. the impurity of hare populations has implications for conservation and population genetics.

20," conjugative plasmids mediate genetic exchange in bacterial communities promoting bacterial adaptation and diversification. broad host range conjugative plasmids, which can transmit between and be stably maintained across phylogenetically diverse hosts, play a particularly important role because they traffic ecologically important accessory genes between species. while broad host ranges benefit plasmids by increasing available hosts, evolutionary theory suggests that the evolution of ecological generalists, such as bhr plasmids, is likely to be constrained by fitness trade-offs. thus single-host environments are expected to select for specialist plasmids, whereas generalist plasmids are expected to evolve in environments where they regularly encounter multiple host bacterial species. previous studies have reported evolutionary changes in the effects of plasmid carriage across different host species following experimental evolution in single or multi-host environments. specifically, the bhr plasmid pb adapted to the originally unfavourable host p. putida h in a single-host environment, whereas in a multi-host environment, stenotrophomonas maltophilia p and p. putida h adaptation of pb to either host species was impeded. a key limitation of previous studies however is that they allow extended periods of bacterium-plasmid co-adaptation, which makes it difficult to disambiguate plasmid adaptation from host adaptation to understand how the plasmids themselves adapt to their hosts. to overcome this limitation here we held the bacterial hosts in evolutionary stasis while allowing only the plasmid to evolve by conjugating the evolving plasmid population into the ancestral bacterial host genotype every 24 h. specifically, to investigate the role of bacterial host species heterogeneity on plasmid evolution we experimentally evolved the environmental mercury resistance plasmid pqbr under single host, pseudomonas fluorescens or pseudomonas putida, or multi-host, both p. fluorescens and p. putida, treatments. we observed evidence for a fitness trade-off in plasmids adapted to the single-host p. fluorescens treatment, but that exposure to p. putida in the multi-host treatment allowed plasmids to circumvent this trade-off.  the conjugation rate of pqbr varied between selection treatments  = , p =  e-07), owing to a lower conjugation rate in p. putida than p. fluorescens, but increased over time in all treatments  = , p =  e-05). this suggests that pqbr adapted to the selection regimes by increasing its conjugation rate. in our experimental set-up, which involved both horizontal and vertical plasmid replication, conjugation is an essential part of the plasmid life-cycle; thus increasing conjugation rate is equivalent to increasing replication rate and therefore perhaps a predictable response to selection. however, increases in conjugation rate can be linked to increased costs of plasmid carriage, which would impair the plasmid’s spread by vertical transmission.fig. a conjugation rate over time for plasmids in the single-host and multi-host treatments; b selection rate of p. fluorescens or p.putida carrying evolved plasmids from the single and multi-host treatments relative to isogenic strains carrying the ancestral plasmid. selection rate of indicates no difference between test and reference strains, error bars: ±sem) to estimate the fitness effects of carrying the evolved plasmids for host bacteria we competed bacteria carrying evolved plasmids against bacteria carrying the ancestral plasmid, in both host species backgrounds. the fitness effect of evolved plasmids depended on the combination of selection treatment and the test host species background. we observed that plasmids from the single-host p. fluorescens treatment evolved lower costs in p. fluorescens, but that this adaptation was accompanied by an increased cost in p. putida relative to the ancestral plasmid. contrastingly, although plasmids from the single-host p. putida treatment evolved marginally lower costs in p. putida, we observed no change to the cost of carriage in p. fluorescens. together this suggests an asymmetric trade-off, whereby pqbr adapted to p. fluorescens suffers a fitness trade-off in p. putida, but that there is not a corresponding fitness trade-off associated with adaptation to p. putida. although we do not know the mechanism underlying the fitness trade-off in this study, previous work suggests that costs of plasmid carriage can arise from a range of mechanisms, including: the metabolic burden, expression of plasmid genes, copy number variation, and interference between plasmid and host cell regulatory systems. it is tempting to speculate that the last of these, regulatory interference, might be the most host-specific and thus more likely to generate the observed fitness trade-off. interestingly, evolved plasmids from the multi-host treatment evolved reduced cost-of-carriage in p. fluorescens but without increasing their cost-of-carriage in p. putida. this suggests that adaptation in a multi-host environment allowed pqbr to circumvent the fitness trade-off associated with adaptation to p. fluorescens in the single-host treatment. we do not know the specific mutations involved in plasmid adaptation in our experiment but the contrasting responses to selection between treatments suggests different genetic mechanisms. in particular, it seems likely that the different responses to selection in the p. fluorescens single-host treatment versus the multi-host treatment are due either to the fixation of different mutations, or the fixation of additional mutation in the multi-host treatment to ameliorate the cost in p. putida of plasmid adaptation in p. fluorescens. environmental heterogeneity is thought to play a key role in the evolution of generalism and specialism in a wide variety of species. heterogeneous environments are predicted to select for generalist genotypes whereas homogeneous environments select for specialist genotypes. for example, evolution experiments with algae adapting to light and dark show that algae adapted to light have lower fitness in dark environments and vice versa, whereas algae exposed to both environments evolve to be generalists. we show that this evolutionary principle also applies to the evolution of mobile genetic elements in different hosts, in this case a conjugative plasmid. we provide evidence for a fitness trade-off associated with adaptation to a single host environment. the appearance of a fitness trade-off can be due, at the genetic level, to antagonistic pleiotropy or mutation accumulation. it seems more likely that the pattern observed here is the result of antagonistic pleiotropy, since there was equal opportunity for mutation accumulation in all treatments, but the trade-off was asymmetric affecting only the plasmids evolving in one of the species. interestingly, exposure to both host species in the multi-host treatment did not constrain adaptation. this suggests that fitness trade-offs can be circumvented if plasmids are exposed to alternative hosts. diverse bacterial communities are likely therefore to select for broad host range plasmids and consequently promote interspecific horizontal gene transfer, with implications for understanding the spread of important plasmid-borne traits like antibiotic resistance.  evolution in a single-host environment selected for host-specialist plasmids due to a fitness trade-off, but this trade-off could be circumvented in the multi-host environment, leading to the evolution of host-generalist plasmids. "," conjugative plasmids play an important role in bacterial evolution by transferring ecologically important genes within and between species. a key limit on interspecific horizontal gene transfer is plasmid host range. here, we experimentally test the effect of single and multi-host environments on the host-range evolution of a large conjugative mercury resistance plasmid, pqbr specifically, pqbr was conjugated between strains of a single host species, either p. fluorescens or p. putida, or alternating between p. fluorescens and p. putida. crucially, the bacterial hosts were not permitted to evolve allowing us to observe plasmid evolutionary responses in isolation.  in all treatments plasmids evolved higher conjugation rates over time. plasmids evolved in single-host environments adapted to their host bacterial species becoming less costly, but in the case of p. fluorescens-adapted plasmids, became costlier in p. putida, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off. when evolved in the multi-host environment plasmids adapted to p. fluorescens without a higher cost in p. putida.  whereas evolution in a single-host environment selected for host-specialist plasmids due to a fitness trade-off, this trade-off could be circumvented in the multi-host environment, leading to the evolution of host-generalist plasmids. http://dx.doi.org/ /501100000781european research councilstg-2012-311490–coevoconissue-copyright-statement© the author 2016 ",60d9d018-d297-43f2-a0cc-b9806ac5e73e,pubmed
21," annotation of gene products for newly sequenced genomes is usually done electronically by transfer of functional information from proteins that have very similar amino acid sequences. however, for many of the proteins in a newly sequenced genome, a database search will not reveal a sequence which shares a high degree of sequence identity of known function and therefore no functional information can reliably be transferred. as a result many sequences are annotated as'hypothetical protein' or'protein of unknown function'. typically some 30–40% of proteins in genomes sequenced so far have no annotation and this is an impediment to the exploitation of genome sequence data. part of the difficult in inferring function from sequence is that sequence similarity is in general a sufficient but not necessary condition for functional or structural similarity and many proteins that have little discernible similarity at the sequence level have similar structures and functions. a major challenge for in silico annotation methods is to identify these remote relationships. accurate identification would enable a larger proportion of the currently sequenced genomes to have putative functional annotation. early database searching methods compared the unknown query sequence with each database sequence in turn. more sensitive methods exploited patterns of conservation that are revealed through multiple sequence alignments by performing sequence-profile comparisons. this is, in effect the approach of intermediate searching methods and also programs such as psi-blast. more recently this approach has been extended to profile-profile comparisons. one of the problems with constructing profiles is how to include a large number of diverse sequences: ideally one would like to include a large amount of diversity, but as more diverse sequences are included the profile is likely to be corrupted due to alignment errors. high throughput structural determination projects are generating large numbers of protein 3-dimensional structures. structure based multiple alignments of proteins are likely to be considerably more accurate than sequence based alignments and we would expect the corresponding profiles to be of higher quality. building a profile for a query sequence of unknown structure is generally done through iterative database search, as implemented in psi-blast. for such sequences of unknown structure there is little choice of method since there is no structural information available. however, it is not clear what the best method is for building profiles of those proteins of known structure and different groups have therefore used differing strategies. one approach is to build one profile representing an entire group of related proteins. this can be done by either using a sequence alignment of the proteins, or using a structure-based alignment of the proteins depending on the availability of sufficient number of 3-d structures for members of the superfamily. the superfamily model can be enriched with close hits from sequence databases to the proteins being modelled, and hybrid profiles with secondary structural information included have shown added value. the alternative strategy is to build individual sequence profiles for each protein in the family, the strategy we refer to as domain models. this is the strategy used by gough. does a single superfamily model of a large number of diverse sequences perform better at the detection of remote superfamily members than using multiple domain models built for each individual member of the superfamily? gough et al concluded that multiple models were more effective. we feel that the question of whether to build domain or superfamily models to represent a superfamily is worth revisiting for a number of reasons. firstly, recent years have seen the development of profile/profile comparison methods. secondly, gough et al only tested how many hits were returned beneath a threshold score. in this paper, we use roc analysis to examine how many hits are returned from all possible true relationships, where true relationships are defined by scop superfamilies. the scop database uses structure to group related proteins, and therefore some of these relationships would not be apparent from sequence considerations alone. finally, we also examine the alignment accuracy produced by the differing models, a question not addressed by gough et al.  remote homolog detection however, in practice, when annotating, one only wishes to consider the region of reliable matches. there are approximately potential false hits in the database. an error rate of % corresponds to hits. figure shows the same roc curves, but in this region of much lower probability of error. in this plot, the superfamily models have a slightly larger area under the curve. they also detect up to 5% more true hits for the same number of errors as the domain models. superfamily specific truncated roc analysis the sixteen superfamilies in our dataset with more than domains are also shown in the figure these represent large and sequence diverse superfamilies. a number of these large, diverse superfamilies such as the s-adenosyl methyltransferases, alpha-beta hydrolases, cytochrome c, thioredoxin and immunoglobulin perform well with both domain and superfamily models, with roc values greater than. similarly the'winged-helix' dna binding domain, the 4-helical cytokines, the nucleic-acid binding domain and the e-set domain perform poorly with both models. for a few superfamilies there exists a large difference in performance between the single and multiple models: the fad/nad superfamily performs better with the superfamily model than with the domain models. conversely, the nad superfamily performs better with the domain models. alignment accuracy discussion does a single profile of a protein superfamily built from structure-based alignments perform better at recognition than multiple domain models? the comparison is not straightforward and this analysis identifies some of the factors that are important in a comparison of single and multiple models using profile-profile methods. the structure-based multiple alignments used to build the profiles for single models may be poor for some of the superfamilies, although in the absence of suitable expert reference alignments this is difficult to assess. a detailed assessment of the validity of the alignment method is described in. in addition, the definition of a superfamily is not without limitations and may change. globally, the use of a set of models representing domains is preferable to using superfamily models. this is in line with previous results. however, for low error thresholds, both types of models perform similarly in terms of the number of homolgous relationships detected. in terms of particular superfamilies, the situation is different. over 20% of the superfamilies tested there was a large difference in performance of domain or superfamily models, evenly distributed to favour either model. in addition to the ability to detect homologs, producing an accurate alignment is also important. we have investigated the accuracy of the alignments produced by both types of model. for many superfamilies, the superfamily model correctly aligns more positions. this suggests that examination of the scoring scheme used for superfamily models could be improved, thereby increasing the accuracy of homology detection.  using a sensitive profile-profile method we have investigated the performance of single structure-based models and multiple sequence models in detecting remote superfamily members. we find that overall, multiple models perform better in recognition although single structure-based models display better alignment accuracy. "," the detection of relationships between a protein sequence of unknown function and a sequence whose function has been characterised enables the transfer of functional annotation. however in many cases these relationships can not be identified easily from direct comparison of the two sequences. methods which compare sequence profiles have been shown to improve the detection of these remote sequence relationships. however, the best method for building a profile of a known set of sequences has not been established. here we examine how the type of profile built affects its performance, both in detecting remote homologs and in the resulting alignment accuracy. in particular, we consider whether it is better to model a protein superfamily using a single structure-based alignment that is representative of all known cases of the superfamily, or to use multiple sequence-based profiles each representing an individual member of the superfamily.  using profile-profile methods for remote homolog detection we benchmark the performance of single structure-based superfamily models and multiple domain models. on average, over all superfamilies, using a truncated receiver operator characteristic we find that multiple domain models outperform single superfamily models, except at low error rates where the two models behave in a similar way. however there is a wide range of performance depending on the superfamily. for 12% of all superfamilies the roc value for superfamily models is greater than above the domain models and for 10% of superfamilies the domain models show a similar improvement in performance over the superfamily models.  using a sensitive profile-profile method we have investigated the performance of single structure-based models and multiple sequence models in detecting remote superfamily members. we find that overall, multiple models perform better in recognition although single structure-based models display better alignment accuracy.

22," chicken is the first major agricultural species for which the complete genome sequencing was undertaken. this is partly due to its position as a model species in various fields of biology including embryo development, oncology, immunology and evolution. moreover, as it is the only bird species for which the genome study is so advanced, very much is expected from its use in comparative genome analyses for annotation, including that of the human genome, by detection of conserved sequences. its intermediate phylogenetic position between mammals and fishes will also certainly provide valuable information on the evolution of vertebrate karyotypes. radiation hybrid maps have a resolution power intermediate to that of the genetic and bac contig maps and are also a powerful tool for the mapping of ests and genes by simple pcr. they are thus useful at two levels: first, they can be used constructively as scaffolds for a correct genome assembly or for detecting and correcting misassembled portions of the genome; second, before obtaining whole annotated genome sequences, they are very efficient tools for inter-species comparative genome analyses through the easy mapping of genes and ests. the successful production of a rh panel in chicken is quite recent, and therefore rh maps are only available for a limited number of chromosomes. having identified qtl for fatness on chicken chromosome, our objective was to build a high-resolution and gene-rich rh map for this chromosome, as a basis for high precision comparative mapping with human and for the development of new polymorphic markers. the available human/chicken comparative mapping data indicated conservation of synteny between gga and portions of hsa hsa and hsa in addition, two genes from hsa had also been shown to be located on gga. this information was used to develop markers from chicken est sequence data orthologous to genes in these human regions, in addition to the existing markers from the chicken chromosome genetic map. while in the process of finishing our map, the first draft sequence assembly of the chicken genome was released. the quality of both the gga rh map and of the sequence assembly was therefore checked by alignment of all the markers by blast searches.  development of est markers in addition to the microsatellite markers from the genetic map, and primer pairs chosen either from available primer data in the literature or designed using the gene sequence deposited in genbank/embl, primer pairs were chosen from chicken est markers selected on the basis of the known conservations of synteny between human and chicken using the iccare software. constraints on the design of primers were to avoid presence of long introns, whose position and length was predicted on the basis of the orthologous human gene structure, and to design primers in the most divergent regions of the human/chicken alignment, to limit cross-amplification with the hamster dna present in the hybrids. one hundred and thirty nine primer pairs out of enabled a successful amplification and the subsequent mapping of the corresponding genes, confirming the high success rate obtained when using the iccare software for designing chicken pcr primers based on est data. construction of the gga rh map altogether, genotyping data was obtained for a total of markers, comprising gene fragments and microsatellites from the gga genetic map. two-point analysis using a lod threshold of enabled to constitute a group of markers, including all the microsatellite markers from the genetic map. the remaining markers correspond to the external boundaries of the regions of conserved synteny with human, from which ests were chosen for marker development and map either to other chromosomes for which rh maps were developed or to unknown regions. after multipoint analysis, a 1000: framework map cr long, comprising a total of markers including microsatellites and ests was obtained. the remaining markers are located relative to the framework map within confidence intervals, to build a comprehensive map. to compare the rh and the genetic maps, the best possible position of the non-framework common markers had to be estimated. that of the markers on the rh map was computed by the carthagene program and is indicated in addition to the confidence interval. for the genetic map, the central position of the marker's confidence interval was used as their most probable position. as a result, the order of the markers on the rh map matches exactly that of the same markers on genetic map, with only one notable discrepancy concerning the position of brf. however, when the position of this gene was checked on the sequence assembly, the agreement was with the rh map, suggesting the position of this gene on the genetic map is erroneous. an average retention frequency of % was observed for the gga markers studied here, although with a high variation, with values ranging from % to %. this finding is within the range observed in other studies reported on this panel: % overall retention using markers chosen genome-wise, % for gga, for gga and 18% for gga. as already noticed for several species including human or cow, but also for chicken chromosomes and, a centromeric effect is detected when observing retention frequencies of markers along the map, with a higher retention of markers in the region between to cr, in which the retention culminates at a value of %, whereas it is around 15% for the rest of the chromosome. alignment of the rh map to the genomic sequence a preliminary data set based on the first draft chicken genome assembly has been deposited into public databases by a team led by r. wilson and w. warren, from the washington university school of medicine in st. louis. we compared our data with the gga sequence, by using blastn searches and sequence alignments. the agreement between the rh framework map and the sequence orders is almost perfect, although with a few discrepancies, most of them suggesting possible improvements to be made in the sequence assembly. first, a group of markers, that we developed on the basis of the conservation of synteny between gga and hsa is assigned to gga in the sequence assembly. three of these markers are on the framework map and for all four, the rh genotypings obtained are very similar to those obtained with the flanking rh framework markers slc17a and arntl, both located on the gga sequence assembly. furthermore, when two-point analysis of the four markers was computed with the flanking markers loc and slc22a suggested in the gga sequence assembly, lod scores were equal to zero. this part of the genome assigned to a wrong chromosome on the sequence assembly covers a region at least cr long, corresponding to a distance of to mb, as estimated from the cr to mb ratio. indeed, the length of the sequence between the two extreme markers cstf and gpr on the gga assembly is mb. the retention frequency of these four markers is amongst the highest of all, suggesting that their location is close to the centromere and that the possible sequence assembly problems are related to this proximity, perhaps due to repetitive sequences. second, we observed an inversion of the gene order for a segment in the upper part of the chromosome adjacent to the group we described as wrongly assigned to gga in the sequence assembly. as the difference of likelihood between our 1000: framework map and the map order in this area suggested from the assembly is higher than we considered that order of the rh map is the correct one. this could also be due to assembly difficulties close to the centromere region. third, several markers absent in the sequence assembly could be localised on the rh map. most of these markers belong to regions for which sequence information is available, but that couldn't be incorporated in the sequence assembly at all or that could be assigned to gga but without a clear location. in addition, one gene also appeared to belong to a region with no sequence available. this gene had previously been located on the cytogenetic map to the short arm of gga, so we consider our data as a confirmation. fourth, we observed a discrepancy in the local order of the two framework map markers mcw and gtf2a however, the difference of likelihood between our framework map and the same map with an inversion of these two markers is only. it is therefore difficult to conclude as to which between the sequence and the rh map presents the correct order. from these data we conclude that radiation hybrid maps can be useful to help detect errors in the draft sequence assembly and for mapping genes either absent or of unknown location in the assembly. comparison cr6000/cm/kb the average cr/cm ratio is when calculated over the whole map length. this relatively high value, as compared to the cr/cm obtained for gga, must be inflected by the disparity observed along the chromosome. this heterogeneity actually reflects disparities in the recombination rate along the chromosome, with recombination events more frequent at the end of the long arm. the agreement between the gene order found on rh map and the sequence assembly is very high. considering only the q arm of the chromosome, the cr/mb ratio is, or kb per cr. this ratio, similar to that obtained for gga, is quite lower than the kb/cr and kb/cr values obtained for gga and gga respectively, suggesting a higher resolution for the larger chromosomes. this result can have two origins: first, the kb/cr ratio is not constant from one chromosome to another, regardless of their physical length; second, the previous calculations were based on physical length values estimated from cytogenetic studies: mb for gga and mb for gga. if we consider the actual chromosome length based on sequence assembly, these chromosomes are shorter than previously estimated, with values of and mb, the ratio is thus now closer to the value we obtain here for gga comparative mapping  we have built a high resolution rh map of chicken chromosome using the chickrh panel. in doing this, we fulfilled our objective of obtaining a detailed comparative map of gga providing jointly a source of potential polymorphic markers and of candidate genes for qtl mapping on this chromosome. at the end of our work, the first draft chicken genome assembly was released and we aligned it to our gga rh map. although we detected a few errors to correct, this allowed us to demonstrate the high quality of the sequence assembly, which may have benefited from a low frequency of repeated elements. in the near future, the chickrh panel will be used to assist in improving the chicken genome assembly. this is clearly needed in the regions for which the genetic map is still not complete, such as some microchromosomes, but also for parts of macrochromosomes, as shown in this study. "," the resolution of radiation hybrid maps is intermediate between that of the genetic and bac contig maps. moreover, once framework rh maps of a genome have been constructed, a quick location of markers by simple pcr on the rh panel is possible. the chicken chickrh panel recently produced was used here to construct a high resolution rh map of chicken gga to confirm the validity of the map and to provide valuable comparative mapping information, both markers from the genetic map and a high number of ests were used. finally, this rh map was used for testing the accuracy of the chicken genome assembly for chromosome  a total of markers were typed on the chickrh rh panel, of which were assigned to gga the final map is composed of framework markers extending over a cr distance. the remaining markers were placed alongside the framework markers within confidence intervals.  the high resolution framework map obtained in this study has markers covering the entire chicken chromosome and reveals the existence of a high number of rearrangements when compared to the human genome. only two discrepancies were observed in relation to the sequence assembly recently reported for this chromosome.

23," one of the most significant tenet of tumor immunology is the assumption that the immune system is able to discriminate between normal and neoplastic tissues. as this distinction is based on the overexpression of taas, the discovery of taas and their molecular and genetic characterization is important in both tumor immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy. the progressive elucidation of the nature of taas recognized by antibodies and t lymphocytes coupled with the elaboration of methods for their isolation and synthesis of their peptides is leading towards new formulations of antitumor vaccines. despite of the fact that long lists of well-characterized taas recognized by t cells and by antibodies are currently available, the attempts to use them to arouse an immune response able to cure tumor patients has met with very little success, at least so far. towards this goal significant obstacles are posed by the patient's state of immunosuppression and the numerous mechanisms to evade the immune response that a tumor progressively acquires. this two order of obstacles might suggest that active immunotherapy is not very appropriate for patients with advanced tumors. a more modern endeavor is to exploit the potential of the immune response elicited by a vaccine against more plausible targets, such as pre-neoplastic lesions. in this case, the immune response may be addressed towards taas that are already present in early lesions and that remain overexpressed during the progression of the tumor. identification of taas on preneoplastic cells will provide the opportunity to trigger the immune system against transformed cells at their earliest manifestation. the availability of animal models of autochthonous carcinogenesis offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify this kind of taas and to test the efficacy of the immune control of preneoplastic lesions. a preneoplastic lesion formed by few cells characterized by an indolent proliferation both displays a limited genetic instability and is more permeable to an immune attack than a large tumor. in addition it is possible that early expressed taas are more suitable target for tumor immune prevention than most of the already defined taas. the characterization of taas expressed in early lesions is a prerequisite for setting up protocols for tumor prevention instead of for tumor cure. the protein product of the oncogene her, igf-r and cyclin b are significant examples of early expressed taas causally involved in the progression of the lesions. mouse strains transgenic for oncogenes or knock-out for oncosuppressor genes that consequently develop defined kind of tumors are being used for preclinical assessment of the potential of preventive vaccines. by combining the information provided by the genome sequence and the expression profiles of entire transcriptomes, these mouse models can also lead towards the identification of taas expressed during progressive stages of carcinogenesis. microarrays are an attractive way of identifying new taas since their procedure is now firmly established and they are well suited to the intrinsic limitations of the biological material to be examined. this paper describes our application of meta-analysis to two balb-neut mice transcription profiling studies to evaluate the possibility of identifying, within the tumor modulated genes, a set of new putative targets to be used as taas instead of or in conjunction with her  our previous demonstration of persistent inhibition of autochthonous preneoplastic lesions in a mouse model of her mammary carcinogenesis by a combined dna and cell vaccine, and the curing of her transplantable tumors by dna vaccination indicates that efficient immunological inhibition of her carcinogenesis can be achieved. we have also shown that two transcriptional profiling studies based on different immunization protocols in balb-neut mice are integrable. since an important issue of dna vaccination is the definition of a set of target genes other that her in order to broaden its effective coverage, we decided to use these data to identify a set of new taas to be used in dna vaccination. datasets seven prototypic situations were evaluated. mammary glands from: 6-week-old mice, displaying atypical hyperplasia; 10-week-old mice, showing atypical hyperplasia and some foci of in situ carcinomas; 15-week-old mice, with diffuse hyperplasia and in situ carcinomas; 19-week-old mice, displaying lobular invasive carcinomas; 22-week-old mice, with palpable carcinomas; 26-week-old mice, with large lobular and metastasizing carcinomas, 2-week-pregnant wild type balb/c mice displaying marked pregnancy-related hyperplasia. wk6nt, wk15nt, wk19nt and wk26nt gland expression profiles were derived from astolfi, wk10nt, wk22nt and wk2prg gland profiles from quaglino. selection of genes whose expression is linearly correlated with the increase of the tumor the number of neoplastic cells in the mammary tissue of balb-neut mice increases constantly during aging, and at 19– weeks a tumor mass becomes palpable in all their mammary glands. previously we have used pca to show that the transcriptional profiles of balb-neut mammary glands are linearly correlated with age. we identified probe sets by linear fitting each gene expression with respect to age. only one probe set was linked to an unmapped est, whereas the others were linked to annotated mouse genes. investigation of specific gene ontology class over-representation within the annotated genes revealed significant enrichments in functions associated with the extracellular compartment. pathway analysis showed the presence of genes involved in the integrin signal transduction pathway linked to her action. evaluation of the expression of tumor-related genes in normal mouse tissues if a taa is to be used as a vaccination target, its expression must be low in normal tissues. to evaluate the expression of the putative taas in normal tissues, we used transcription profiles recently published by su. the mouse atlas was generated by using a custom affymetrix array which interrogates annotated mouse genes: of the putative taas are present in gnfm, twelve of them characterized by low expression in normal mouse tissues. expression of tumor related genes in normal and cancer human tissues the genes identified as taas were expressed in all the stages of breast carcinogenesis in balb-neut mice and characterized by low expression in normal mouse tissues. to determine whether these characteristics were also present in the corresponding human genes, we cross-validated the expression of the taas within the human tissue expression atlas published by yanai. since her is expressed at very low levels in normal human tissues, we used it as the ""ideal reference"" of low expression. rtn irf sel1l were discarded since their expression levels in some human tissues were higher than those of her. tes, rcn rnf cradd, galnt clca cdcp socs and spred were expressed at levels similar to her we also assessed the expression of these taas in human breast specimens. of the breast cancer transcriptional profiling data sets available, that proposed by van't veer is ideal because its experimental structure allows evaluation of the expression level distribution within the specimens. fold change variation of each specimen is measured with respect to a reference pool composed by mixing the same amount of all rna of the sporadic patients. the taas and her were represented in the van't veer set, her was highly expressed, while tes, rcn rnf cradd and galnt were medium expressed. clca cdcp socs and spred were low expressed group and since their expression was times lower than that of her they were discarded as putative vaccination targets. even though tes, rcn rnf cradd and galnt were less expressed than her they were less scattered than her. the highest expressed is tes, which maps to a fragile site on chromosome 7q and may have a tumor suppression activity. it is homogeneously expressed in all the cancer specimens in the van't veer set. the function of rcn reticulocalbin, has not been characterized. it is implicated in tumor cell invasiveness, as it is expressed in the highly invasive breast cancer cell lines, but not in poorly invasive ones. rnf is a ring-finger protein which acts as a transcription regulator, it is not only a coactivator in steroid receptor-dependent transcription but also activates transcription from steroid-independent promoters. it is expressed at very high levels in testis and at much lower levels in several other tissues. when ectopically expressed, it inhibits the proliferation of both somatic and germ cell tumor-derived cells. cradd encodes a death domain -containing protein and induces apoptosis. galnt encodes udp-galnac transferase a member of the galnac-transferases family. in gallbladder cancer, the presence of diffuse-type localization of galnac-t in the subserosal layer is correlated with aggressiveness. furthermore, galnt expression is associated with the differentiation and aggressiveness of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  this study identified putative taas. three were discarded because they were expressed in some normal human tissues and four because their expression was too low in human cancer specimens. tes, rcn rnf cradd and galnt were retained for further studies. this work was based on in silico analysis of published transcriptional profiling studies. its results must now be referred back to the in vivo pre-clinical experimentation. we shall select the most immunogenic domains of the candidate taas and use them in vaccination protocols in balb-neut mice. other interesting taas may have been missed in this analysis since it integrates two independent experiments and this increases the experimental noise. a further limitation could be the partial coverage of the mouse transcriptome of the arrays employed. a new transcription profiling study covering the same experimental points, but using full genome-wide mouse arrays is now in progress. "," neoplastic transformation is a multistep process in which distinct gene products of specific cell regulatory pathways are involved at each stage. identification of overexpressed genes provides an unprecedented opportunity to address the immune system against antigens typical of defined stages of neoplastic transformation. her-2/neu/erbb oncogene is a prototype of deregulated oncogenic protein kinase membrane receptors. mice transgenic for rat her were studied to evaluate the stage in which vaccines can prevent the onset of her driven mammary carcinomas. as her is not overexpressed in all mammary carcinomas, definition of an additional set of tumor associated antigens expressed at defined stages by most breast carcinomas would allow a broader coverage of vaccination. to address this question, a meta-analysis was performed on two transcription profile studies to identify a set of new taa targets to be used instead of or in conjunction with her  the five taas identified are those whose expression is linearly related to the tumor mass increase in balb-neut mammary glands. moreover, they have a low expression in normal tissues and are generally expressed in human breast tumors, though at a lower level than her  although the number of putative taas identified is limited, this pilot study suggests that meta-analysis of expression profiles produces results that could assist in the designing of pre-clinical immunopreventive vaccines. 17– march italian society of bioinformatics: annual meeting milan, italy ",cc5ca509-93d8-4129-884f-52d86537e640,pubmed
24," chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by dna microarray hybridization is a powerful technology for the systematic identification of genomic sites at which transcription factors bind or histone proteins bear post-translational modifications. the raw microarray intensity readings themselves are not immediately useful to researchers, though. through a number of bioinformatic analysis steps, one can obtain from the raw data a processed list of genomic sites and quantitative measures such as strength of evidence for a site, its extent, and estimates of relative occupancy. we provide a freely available, open-source software module ringo for the import of the raw microarray data, their quality assessment, normalization, visualization, and for the detection and quantitation of chip-enriched regions. its functionality covers the complete primary analysis for chip-chip tiling microarrays, especially those from the company nimblegen. ringo is integrated with the bioconductor project of bioinformatic extension packages to the r statistical software. this design makes it easy for users to construct sophisticated analyses approaches that also leverage other r/bioconductor functionality, for example additional normalization methods from the affy and oligo packages, or wavelet analysis methods from r's signal processing packages. ringo is complementary to existing available software for chip microarray analysis. for example, mpeak, timat, mat, tilemap, acme, hgmm, and chipotle provide powerful model-based and non-parametric algorithms for finding chip-enriched regions on normalized and quality controlled chip-chip data. a focus of these softwares has been to provide easy-to-use interfaces to these algorithms, and users are asked to use them in combination with other tools for the data import, preprocessing and follow-up statistical and bioinformatic analysis. a unique aspect of ringo is that it facilitates the construction of more automated programmed workflows and offers benefits in the scalability, reproducibility and methodical scope of the analyses. implementation ringo is an extension package for the programming language and statistical environment r. most of its functionality is also implemented in r, for some performance-critical computations c++ functions are used. the package has been developed to analyze two-color chip-chip oligonucleotide microarrays from the company nimblegen. analogous two-color tiling array platforms from other vendors can also be processed. the package employs functions from other packages of the bioconductor project, most notably from the package limma, it employs object classes that are also standard in other bioconductor packages, such as limma's rglist and biobase's expressionset, and provides a new object class for representing identified chip-enriched regions.  the package contains functions to read in the raw nimblescan output files of the microarrays into an rglist object. the user can alternatively choose to supply other raw microarray data in rglist format. such an object is essentially a list and contains the raw intensities of the two hybridizations for the red and green channel plus information on the probes on the array and on the analyzed samples. ringo contains an extensive set of functions for quality assessment of the data. its image function allows one to look at the spatial distribution of the intensities on a chip. this can be useful to detect obvious artifacts on the array, such as scratches, bright spots, finger prints etc. that might render parts or all of the readouts invalid. to assess whether probe tiling across the chromosome affects levels of close-by probes, one can look at the autocorrelation plot. for each base-pair offset d, it is assessed how strong the intensities of probes at genomic positions x + d are correlated with the probe intensities at positions x. the computed correlation is plotted against the offset d. for regions that are present in the immuno-precipitate or in the genomic input sample, high autocorrelation is to be expected in a range corresponding to the size distribution of the fragmented dna. the autocorrelation is relevant for the quality assessment of data and has to be taken into account in subsequent statistical analyses. furthermore, if the data set contains biological or technical replicates, low correlation between replicate samples' intensities may indicate microarrays of questionable quality. ringo therefore contains functions to visualize the correlation between replicate samples' raw and preprocessed intensities. following quality assessment of the data, one usually aims to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data by normalization of the probe intensities and derive fold changes of probes' intensities in the enriched sample divided by their intensities in the non-enriched input sample and take the logarithm of these ratios. for normalization, ringo provides a number of choices, interfacing preprocessing methods implemented in the bioconductor packages vsn and limma plus the tukey-biweight scaling of the log-ratios that is suggested by nimblegen. the normalization procedure results in an expressionset object of normalized probe levels, the basic bioconductor object class for microarray data, with which many other bioconductor packages can easily interact. in addition, a mapping between probes on the microarray and genomic positions is required. ringo uses a set of tables relating chromosomal positions to feature identifiers on the array. the package provides scripts that assist in the production of such a table from either a nimblegen pos file or, what is often preferable, custom alignments of the probe sequences to the genome of interest. an important aspect of genomic data analysis is a thorough observation of as many data examples as possible using a number of different visualization techniques. in addition to the multitude of visualization functions offered by other r and bioconductor packages, ringo provides a function to display estimates of log fold enrichment with probes mapped to matching chromosomal positions. on the normalized probe levels, one next aims to identify those genomic regions that show enrichment in the immuno-precipitated sample as compared to the untreated input sample. ringo contains a heuristic algorithm that we developed to identify genomic regions bearing certain histone modifications. the details of this algorithm are described in the package vignette. it is built upon a smoothing procedure: smoothing across genomically neighboring probes is often employed to ameliorate probe-specific variability in the data, that is, the effect that different probes measure the same target dna amount with different efficiency. this may be caused by different qualities of probe synthesis on the array, probe gc content, target cdna secondary structure, cross-hybridization, and other reasons. an important issue with enrichment detection procedures is background signal: some non-antibody-bound dna may be pulled down during the immuno-precipitation and consequently enriched, potentially resulting in false positives. the enrichment detection algorithm in ringo is a first and sufficiently effective approach to these problems, but more research is necessary to establish optimal methodology.  the functionality of the software package ringo provides a good starting point for researchers interested in the analysis of nimblegen chip microarrays or of similar data. it is an add-on package for the widely used programming language and statistical environment r, and integrates with the bioconductor project of bioinformatic r extension packages. as other bioconductor/r packages, ringo offers a high level of documentation through its vignette and the function help pages, and the access to the documentation is standardized. furthermore, also the distribution, installation and maintenance of the packages are standardized, and responsive and competent user support is provided through the bioconductor mailing list. these features are often difficult to find with free, open-source software. ringo provides a comprehensive set of functions for quality assessment, data processing, visualization and chip-chip data analysis. the package's close integration with other bioconductor packages opens up a multitude of subsequent analysis approaches. availability and requirements the r-package ringo is available from the bioconductor web site at and runs on linux, mac os and ms-windows. it requires an installed version of r, which is freely available from the comprehensive r archive network at, and other bioconductor packages, namely biobase, affy, geneplotter, limma, and vsn plus the cran package rcolorbrewer. the easiest way to obtain the most recent version of the software, with all its dependencies, is to follow the instructions at. ringo is distributed under the terms of the artistic license. authors' contributions all authors contributed significantly to the final version of the software package. jt wrote the manuscript. all authors read and approved of the final version of the manuscript.

of these sequences can have profound biological and medical consequences. methods the full version of rete requires a local installation with a mysql database. the basic principle of rete is ""fragment threading"". a collection of conserved motifs are tested against the sequence to be evaluated. a chaining algorithm stitches together motif hits, which conform to limits specified in an intermotif distance table, to a ""retroviral chain"" which best fits the retroviral genus, distances and degree of motif similarity. each chain is given a ""retroviral score"" which in essence describes the degree of conformity to a retroviral structure model. protein translations are interpreted with the help of several algorithms, one being the degree of fit to an alignment of reference retroviral proteins, others focused on finding the starts and ends of the protein. in problematic cases, alternative chains and alternative putein interpretations are given. unlike most other retrovirus-finding algorithms, rete is not dependent on repetition, neither of ltrs nor of proviruses. it is therefore especially important for finding low copy number proviruses, like ervfc. the rete installation may take some time for unexperienced users. with the latter in mind, we have now created a ""light"" version of rete, rol. rol uses the same collection of conserved motifs and the same intermotif distance table as rete. the results of rol should be the same as with rete. however, rete contains several additional features, like ltr divergence, nucleotide frequency and most similar reference sequences, which are not present in rol. rol does not require specific installation procedures. it can be accessed via the world wide web. rol was implemented under the batchelor web interface. batchelor is written in php and designed to act as a wrapper around an existing standalone application and to integrate it with the web. as a batch queue manager, batchelor allows jobs with long run times to be submitted to the web server and scheduled for later execution by its batch queue. users can monitor the state of their submitted jobs and later download the result from the queue view. the user interface is customizable through templates and extendable through user defined callback functions. among its features are job control, statistics and web service interfaces. rol and batchelor run on a dell poweredge server with × quad core xeon ghz processors, gb ram with a 64-bit gentoo linux operative system.  the retrotector online implementation the rol implementation, under the batchelor web interface, allows both genbank accession number, file and fasta cut-and-paste admission of sequences. up to ten submissions can be done simultaneously. thus, a batch analysis of <= megabases can be specified in one instance. jobs are shown in an ip-number specific list. results are downloadable as text files. the text files derive from base chunks. names of chunks which contain one or several retroviral chains detected by rete are shown in bold face. each retrovirus-positive chunk can be inspected by means of the stand-alone program, retrotectorviewer.jar, which has the full graphical capabilities of the basic rete program. it can export in eps, pdf and jpg formats. thus, a detailed analysis of any retroviral sequences found in the submitted sequence is graphically presented. with the current server, a complete analysis of a megabase sequence is complete in under minutes. it is possible to mask nonretroviral repetitive sequences in the submitted sequence before analysis, using host genome specific ""brooms"". this increases the specificity of the analysis. an example is the analysis of ervfc a gammaretroviruslike sequence which has several orfs and near-orfs. this low copy number sequence was present in previous assemblies of the human genome, but has been edited out of the hg assembly. the provirus shown is from the pantro chimpanzee genome assembly. this illustrates the importance of independent retrovirus sequence detection systems, like rete and rol. discussion several pattern recognition algorithms for recognition of retroviral sequences exist. the algorithms generally have a specific purpose. either they emphasize ltrs, repetitiveness, conserved motifs, or open reading frames. a combined search therefore may be called for. rete is unique in its detailed analysis of the internal proviral sequences and classification of the provirus. it is modular, which allows users to add their own program modules. despite the existence of several programs for detection of retroviral sequences, a number of problems remain. several portions, especially the long terminal repeats, of retroviral genomes do not encode proteins. the detection of noncoding nucleic acid sequences is a specific instance of the more general problem of pattern recognition. the methods used in rete for ltr detection are mainly artificial neural networks and heuristic motif combinations. these are combined with detection of conserved protein coding motifs and reading frames using pairwise and multiple amino-acid alignments. rete is mainly targeted to higher vertebrate genomes. for analysis of other genomes, a further optimization for detection of meta- and pseudoviridae sequences is necessary. these retrovirus-related sequences are abundant in lower vertebrates, insects and plants, among others. rol is intended for analysis of 5– kbases of genomic sequence. for example, a batch job of different cosmid sequences of 1– mbases can be specified via a list of their genbank accession numbers. sequences of entire small chromosomes, like human chromosomes and can be entered via cut-and-paste, accession number or as a downloaded file. the sensitivity and specificity of rol is the same as that of rete. however, a judgement regarding the choice of ""brooms"" must be made. brooms are a set of preselected nonretroviral repetitive sequences prevalent in the host genome under study. currently, brooms for higher primate, artiodactyl, rodent, bird and marsupial genomes are available at the rol site. the brooms remove many of the weak false signals from ltr-like sequences. ltrs are difficult to detect because they usually do not code for proteins and therefore contain very few conserved motifs detectable by the unaided eye. in addition some parts of the ltrs consist of repetitive elements like c-rich or gt-rich regions that can easily be matched by other repetitive elements like alus. this can spur incorrect chain formation by rete and can result in poor detection specificities. the user may experiment with different brooms to obtain an optimal result.  rol offers a convenient way to quickly search for, annotate and present retroviral sequences in genomic sequences. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions gs wrote the rete and retrotectorviewer java

participated in the writing of the manuscript. jb is the retrovirologist behind rete, tested the user interface, provided ideas on useful features and participated in the writing of the manuscript. "," the rapid accumulation of genomic information in databases necessitates rapid and specific algorithms for extracting biologically meaningful information. more or less complete retroviral sequences, also called proviral or endogenous retroviral sequences; ervs, constitutes at least 5% of vertebrate genomes. after infecting the host, these retroviruses have integrated in germ line cells, and have then been carried in genomes for at least several million years. a better understanding of structure and function of these sequences can have profound biological and medical consequences. methods retrotector© is a platform-independent java program for identification and characterization of proviral sequences in vertebrate genomes. the full rete requires a local installation with a mysql database. although not overly complicated, the installation may take some time. a ""light"" version of rete, which does not require specific installation procedures is provided, via the world wide web.  rol was implemented under the batchelor web interface. it allows both genbank accession number, file and fasta cut-and-paste admission of sequences. up to ten submissions can be done simultaneously, allowing batch analysis of <= megabases. jobs are shown in an ip-number specific list. results are text files, and can be viewed with the program, retrotectorviewer.jar, which has the full graphical capabilities of the basic rete program. a detailed analysis of any retroviral sequences found in the submitted sequence is graphically presented, exportable in standard formats. with the current server, a complete analysis of a megabase sequence is complete in minutes. it is possible to mask nonretroviral repetitive sequences in the submitted sequence, using host genome specific ""brooms"", which increase specificity. discussion proviral sequences can be hard to recognize, especially if the integration occurred many million years ago. precise delineation of ltr, gag, pro, pol and env can be difficult, requiring manual work. rol is a way of simplifying these tasks.  rol provides annotation and presentation of known retroviral sequences, detection of proviral chains in unknown genomic sequences, with up to mbase per submission. 18– september european molecular biology network conference 2008: 20th anniversary celebration martina franca, italy ",d580e702-a7ba-4330-9394-b1e04af041a2,pubmed
26," chromatin-immunoprecipitation on chip is a technique for identifying protein-dna interactions. for this purpose, the chromatin is bound to the protein of interest, then trimmed to yield a protein-bound fraction of dna. the protein-bound fraction of dna is then immunoprecipitated with a protein-specific antibody and hybridized to tiling microarrays. the complex experimental procedure and the high dimensionality of the output data require thorough bioinformatical analyses which assess the quality of the experiments and ensures the reliability of the results. the practical need for a chip-chip analysis tool has led to the development of either gui-based or command line-oriented software. we favor the command line solution, which has been realized in our software, because virtually every chip-chip experiment requires flexible adaptations to its individual design as well as customized methods to test the hypotheses under investigation. implementation we present the open-source software package starr, which is available as part of the open source bioconductor project. it is an extension package for the programming language and statistical environment r. starr facilitates analysis of chip-chip data, with particular but not exclusive support of the affymetrix™ microarray platform. its functionality comprises remapping of probe sequences to the genome, data import, quality assessment, and visual data exploration. starr provides new high level analysis tools, e.g., the alignment of chip signals along annotated gene features, and combined analysis of the chip signals and complementary gene expression measurements. it uses the standard microarray data structures of bioconductor, thus building on and fully exploiting the package ringo. the sequence mapping algorithm and some functions for peak finding are implemented in c to increase computation speed. the mapping of the probes to the position of the genome are stored in an object of the bioconductor class probeanno. intensity measurements from the chip experiments are stored in an expressionset object, which makes the results of starr accessible to all other r packages that operate on these common classes.  preparation sometimes a remapping of reporters to the genome may be necessary. this prevents probe sequences matching to either none or multiple sites of a current genome sequence, which might happen in the case of a probe annotation file being built upon an outdated version of the target species' genome sequence. mending these false matches is mandatory, because all subsequent steps rely on correct probe annotation. until now, this task required external programs like xman or mummer, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. starr contains a novel update function for microarray probe annotation files. it implements the aho-corasick algorithm, which is designed for efficient string matching. remapping all probe sequences with starr takes only seconds for small genomes like yeast and minutes for larger genomes like human. the result is a corrected, ready-to-use bpmap file. preprocessing we facilitated data import as much as possible, since in our experience, this is a major obstacle for the widespread use of r packages in the field of chip-chip analysis. data import from the microarray manufacturers nimblegen and agilent has already been implemented in ringo, the affymetrix array platform is covered by starr. there are two kinds of files that must be known to starr: the.bpmap file which contains the mapping of the reporter sequences to their physical position on the array, and the.cel files which contain the actual measurement values. all data, no matter from which platform, are stored in the common bioconductor object expressionset, which makes them accessible to a number of r packages operating on that data structure. the built-in import procedure of starr furthermore automatically creates r objects containing additional annotation, which is indespensible for our purposes. there exist alternative import functions, e.g., in the packages affytiling, oligo or rmat, but these do not extract all the information we need, and often they use a different format. genomic annotation can either be read directly from a gff file or obtained via the biomart package. it would be desirable to discuss the structure of cel and gff files and of the expressionset/probeanno classes at greater length, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. we refer to the vignette of the starr package, which addresses these more technical aspects in detail. the obligatory second step in the analysis protocol is quality control. the complex experimental procedures of a chip-chip assay make errors almost inevitable. a special issue of affymetrix oligo arrays is the intensity bias caused by the sequence-specific gc-content of the oligomer probes. sometimes this bias is not appropriately corrected due to improper normalization. thus we included a new quality control plot routine for examining measurement bias and variation before and after normalization. starr displays the average expression of probes as a function of their gc-content, and it calculates a position-specific bias of every nucleotide in each of the positions within the probe. we used this visulization to check whether the mat normalization method does accurately correct for sequence-specific hybridization bias. we used the r implementation rmat of the algorithm for normalization. as is shown in figure it partly removes the systematic errors in the unnormalized data, yet the diagnostic plot reveals a strong residual bias in the processed data. we compared the performance of mat to that of a normalization by a reference experiment. such control measurements are obtained by either performing a mock immunoprecipitation, i.e. an immunoprecipitation which is designed to reflect unspecific antibody binding, or by simply digesting and processing genomic dna of that organism. it turns out that a rank percentile normalization of experiment and reference, followed by a simple subtraction of the reference from the experiment measurements yields substantially better results than rmat. we therefore advise experimentalists to perform at least one control immunoprecipitation for normalization purposes. moreover, starr provides many other quality control plots like an in silico reconstruction of the physical array image to identify flawed regions on the array, or pairwise ma-plots, boxplots and heat-scatter plots to visualize pairwise dependencies within the dataset. for the purpose of bias removal, starr interfaces the package limma. it also contains standard normalization methods like the loess normalization, or the median-rank-percentile normalization proposed by buck and lieb in. for a comparison of chip-chip normalization methods, see recent publications. high-level analysis we demonstrate the utility of starr by applying it to a yeast rna-polymerase ii chip experiment. one of the most prominent purposes of chip experiments is the identification and localization of peaked binding events on the genome. although, by virtue of compatibility, we can draw on the facilities of other peak detection algorithms like ringo, acme or bac, we implemented a novel algorithm - cmarrt - which was developed by p.f. kuan and performs well in practice. for further postprocessing of chip-enriched regions, we suggest the r package chippeakanno. starr provides functions for the visualization of a set of ""profiles"" along genomic positions. our profileplot function relates to the conventional mean value plot like a box plot relates to an individual sample mean: let the profiles be given as the rows of a samples × positions matrix that contains the respective signal of a sample at a given position. instead of plotting a line for each profile, the q-quantiles for each position are calculated, where q runs through a set of representative quantiles. then for each q, the profile line of the q-quantiles is plotted. color coding of the quantile profiles further aids the interpretation of the plot. another useful high-level plot in starr is the correlationplot, which displays the correlation of a gene-related binding signal to its corresponding gene expression. figure shows a plot in which the mean polii occupancy in various transcript regions of genes is compared to the corresponding mrna expression. each region is defined by its begin and end position relative to the transcription start and termination site. the regions are plotted in the lower panel of figure for each region, the correlation between the vector of mean occupancies and the vector of gene expression values is calculated and shown in the upper panel. the correlation plot reveals that polii occcupancy at the transcription start is not a good predictor of mrna expression, but the mean occupancy of polii in the elongation phase is. we expect that a more detailed analysis of particular gene groups, and a comparison of polii profiles under different environmental conditions will yield valuable new insights.  apart from covering the standard processes of data acquisition and preprocessing, starr is a bioconductor package that offers a range of novel high-level tools that greatly enhance the exploration of chip-chip experiments. those include functions like peak finding, summary visualization of gene groups, and correlation analysis with expression data. on the side of the low-level analysis, we implemented a convenient probe remapping algorithm that helps to keep annotation standards high. by relying on standard bioconductor object classes, starr can easily interface other bioconductor packages. it therefore makes the full functionality of ringo amenable to the analysis of affymetrix tiling arrays. all functions and methods in the starr package are well documented in help pages and in a vignette, which also contains a sample workflow in r. altogether, starr constitutes a powerful and comprehensive tool for tiling array analysis across established one- and two-color technologies like affymetrix, agilent and nimblegen. availability and requirements the r-package starr is available from the bioconductor web site at http://www.bioconductor.org and runs on linux, mac os and ms-windows. it requires an installed version of r, which is freely available from the comprehensive r archive network at http://cran.r-project.org, and other bioconductor packages,

supported by the'sonderforschungsbereich' sfb "," chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with dna microarrays is an assay used for investigating dna-protein-binding or post-translational chromatin/histone modifications. as with all high-throughput technologies, it requires thorough bioinformatic processing of the data for which there is no standard yet. the primary goal is to reliably identify and localize genomic regions that bind a specific protein. further investigation compares binding profiles of functionally related proteins, or binding profiles of the same proteins in different genetic backgrounds or experimental conditions. ultimately, the goal is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the effects of dna binding events on gene expression.  we present a free, open-source r/bioconductor package starr that facilitates comparative analysis of chip-chip data across experiments and across different microarray platforms. the package provides functions for data import, quality assessment, data visualization and exploration. starr includes high-level analysis tools such as the alignment of chip signals along annotated features, correlation analysis of chip signals with complementary genomic data, peak-finding and comparative display of multiple clusters of binding profiles. it uses standard bioconductor classes for maximum compatibility with other software. moreover, starr automatically updates microarray probe annotation files by a highly efficient remapping of microarray probe sequences to an arbitrary genome.  starr is an r package that covers the complete chip-chip workflow from data processing to binding pattern detection. it focuses on the high-level data analysis, e.g., it provides methods for the integration and combined

27," photodynamic therapy is a promising modality in both the curative and palliative treatment against a variety of experimental and naturally occurring human cancers. essentially, pdt is a two-step process that begins with the administration of photosensitizer for selective uptake in the target tissue. the second phase involves exposure to non-thermal light at a wavelength specific to the photosensitizer at the sensitized target tissue. the activation of the photosensitizer by light is an oxygen-dependent process that results in the generation of highly cytotoxic species including singlet oxygen. the release of these reactive molecules results in damage to both tumor cells and to the tumor microenvironment. the significance of pdt is that there is a degree of treatment selectivity that allows tumor destruction with minimal involvement of healthy tissue. this is achieved by a combination of selective accumulation of photosensitizer within the tumor and by control of the light geometry and illumination parameters. lung cancer became one of the first cancers to be considered for pdt and has been used as an adjuvant treatment over the last years. currently, pdt is used either to treat microinvasive endobronchial non-small cell lung carcinoma or to palliate patients with completely or partially obstructing endobronchial nsclc. despite the generally refractory nature of these type of tumors, central type of tumors with identifiable endobronchial lesions which could be easily accessed bronchoscopically for illumination have been successfully treated with pdt. pdt can preserve lung function, limiting surgical trauma and postoperative pain as well as used in combination with other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy. photosensitizer-induced fluorescence detection aimed at enhancing optical contrast to improve tumor visibility has been extensively investigated to develop'tumor selective' imaging methods. the lack of tumor selectivity, complex pharmacokinetics and the fact that some photosensitizers may cause prolonged skin photosensitivity, make the clinical application of fluorescence detection and pdt more complex. these limitations have led to the development of second-generation photosensitizers, which usually produce shorter periods of photosensitivity, longer activation wavelengths, higher tumor-to-normal tissue concentration, excellent antitumor effect and higher quantum yields of 1o. studies showed that derivatives from chlorophylls/chlorins are potent photosensitizers, of which mono-l-aspartyl chlorin e is undergoing clinical trials in japan for the treatment of endobronchial lung cancer. this report investigates a new formulation that consists of a mixture of chlorin e derived from the plant spirullina platensis and polyvinylpyrrolidone. pvp is a biocompatible hydrophilic polymer that has been used to improve dissolution of lipophilic drugs and to modify the biodistribution of the drug. the mixture of ce and pvp has a mass fraction ratio of 1: ce6-pvp absorbs light of wavelength above nm and produces less long-term normal tissue phototoxicity than photofrin. in our previous studies, we have demonstrated that ce6-pvp selectively accumulated in the poorly differentiated human nasopharyngeal and human bladder carcinoma xenografts in animal models. we have also reported the potential application of ce6-pvp in photodynamic therapy in one angiosarcoma patient. the present work examines the fluorescence pharmacokinetic of ce6-pvp in nsclc and small cell lung carcinoma xenografts on the chick chorioallantoic membrane model. we have applied the receiver operating characteristics concept to compare the sensitivity and specificity of fluorescence imaging on nsclc and sclc using white light as the gold standard. photosensitizing efficacy of ce6-pvp was also investigated between the two histology of lung carcinoma using murine xenografts model.  fluorescence bronchoscopy has been reported to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and definition of the intra-epithelial cancer within the bronchi. this technique has become more attractive for clinical use since more effective 2nd generations of photosensitizers have been clinically implemented and tested. newer formulations of photosensitizers were intended to reduce common side effects such as skin photosensitivity, nausea, vomiting and transiently raised liver transaminase levels. following the above rationale, we have investigated the use of pvp in combination with ce for application in lung cancers. as it was important to establish if cellular localization of ce6-pvp was also exhibited in human lung tumor, the cam tumor xenograft was employed here. we have demonstrated that this method of examining fluorescence uptake and retention in tissue explants on the cam model provides a reliable means for direct, comparative visualization in situ of human tumors. inoculation of human nsclc and sclc into highly vascularized cam led to the disseminated tumor growth on the surface of the cam. typical fluorescence intensity image of nsclc and sclc are illustrated in fig. 2b and 2d, respectively. intense red fluorescence was macroscopically visible in the tumor cells under blue light, as compared to non-malignant epithelium of the cam after minutes post incubation with ce6-pvp. the fluorescence retention by the lung tumor xenografts after topical administration was quantitatively evaluated using image-processing techniques and charted as a function of time. high differential fluorescence intensity was observed between nsclc xenografts and its surrounding normal cam tissue compared to sclc xenografts. the average of the red-to-blue intensity ratio of nsclc xenograft was higher than that of sclc xenograft. the fluorescence intensity elimination rate constant for nsclc, sclc and normal cam was calculated to be,, and min- respectively, suggesting that ce6-pvp is being retained longer in nsclc than sclc. normal cam had a faster elimination rate of ce6-pvp. we have applied roc curve analysis from to h post administration of ce6-pvp to validate the ability of the photosensitizer to discriminate nsclc and sclc from normal cam membrane. the area under the curve were then compared in order to make a fair judgment of the effectiveness of ce6-pvp without being constricted to single values of sensitivity and specificity, which largely depend on the cut-off fluorescence intensity value chosen to distinguish normal from malignant region. the following is a rough guide for classifying the accuracy of ce6-pvp based on the auc: – = excellent; – = good; – = fair; – = poor; and – = fail. the auc for nsclc were,, and, at h, h and h respectively indicating that shorter exposure times resulted in lower accuracy. the greatest auc was observed from h post drug administration onwards: i.e., and at h, h and h respectively. for sclc, the auc were,,,,, and at h, h, h, h, h and h respectively. this result showed no improvement in fluorescence accuracy in demarcating sclc from the normal surrounding cam. to evaluate the overall quality of fluorescence intensity discrimination between nsclc and sclc, a combined roc was generated from to h post drug administration. the sensitivity and the specificity were calculated using different threshold values to distinguish healthy from malignant tissue. for nsclc, the highest combined sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 78%, whereas for sclc it was 57% and 79% respectively, implying that fluorescence mediated ce6-pvp had distinctly higher rate of sensitivity for the detection of disseminated lesions of nsclc than with sclc. an area of represents a perfect discrimination of tumor from normal tissue; an area of represents no discrimination between normal and abnormal. the p value indicates whether the area under the roc is significantly different from. *if the p value is <, the area under the roc curve is significantly different. for tumors, each point represents a mean of eggs whereas for normal, each point represents a mean of eggs. to determine the efficacy of ce6-pvp mediated pdt, nude mice bearing nsclc and sclc tumors were administered with mg/kg of the photosensitizer. pdt was performed on using light generated by a diode laser system at the light dose of j/cm and fluence rate of mw/cm the area of tumor necrosis was measured by evan's blue dye staining at h post pdt. strong heterogeneous staining was observed in the untreated controls indicating occurrence of spontaneous, albeit limited necrosis, whereas in the pdt treated tumor, tissue damage was clearly evident as an unstained area. nsclc tumors irradiated at and h drug-light interval exhibited extent of tumor necrosis of ± 7% and ± 4% respectively. when pdt treatment was performed on sclc models using the same parameter, it was observed that irradiation at h drug-light interval resulted in ± 9% of tumor necrosis while irradiation at h drug-light interval resulted in ± 8% tumor necrosis. thus, we conclude that sclc were only moderately sensitive to ce6-pvp mediated pdt. almost all pdt studies were concerned with nsclc due to the referral patterns in the clinics. although pdt has also been shown to be effective in the clinical treatment of sclc, little preclinical data exist comparing the efficacy or tendency for resistance toward photosensitization between these two tumor histologies. in this study, we observed a certain degree of resistance to pdt in sclc xenografts that could be related to faster elimination rate of ce6-pvp, which resulted in lower cellular accumulation of the photosensitizer. there are already a variety of molecular markers that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sclc thus making it difficult to hypothesize the molecular basis of acquired resistance towards photosensitization in our experiments. generally, in lung cancer four types of multidrug resistance have been identified, i.e., classical multidrug resistance, non-p-glycoprotein mdr, atypical mdr and lung resistance-related protein. previous evidence indicates that sclc cell lines and tumors express multidrug resistance-associated protein, i.e. mrp atp binding cassette c and abcg. hence, one plausible reason to explain the lack of activity of ce6-pvp in sclc is the possible existence of abc transporters of chlorin-based photosensitizers in this tumor histology. the importance of human abcg in the transport of tetrapyrrole structure has been implicated. it was reported that cancer cell lines that expresses abcg was found to efflux some of the chlorophyll based photosensitizers and thus may confer resistance to this treatment modality. it has been suggested that by inhibiting abcg transport using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is likely to be a more successful approach to enhancing clinical pdt.  photosensitization with ce6-pvp for hours of exposure time appeared to be most effective in detecting nsclc in cam model. furthermore, pdt at h drug-light interval resulted in a better tumor necrosis in nsclc xenograft model. sclc xenografts were found to manifest a certain degree of resistance to photosensitization with ce6-pvp. despite the limited activity of ce6-pvp in the sclc xenografts, it is conceivable that the combined modality of fluorescence imaging and targeted photodynamic therapy using ce6-pvp may still have a potential role in sclc. this warrants for additional studies on the molecular mechanisms of photosensitization resistance in sclc to overcome this important clinical problem. "," photodynamic therapy is an effective local cancer treatment that involves light activation of a photosensitizer, resulting in oxygen-dependent, free radical-mediated cell death. little is known about the comparative efficacy of pdt in treating non-small cell lung carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma, despite ongoing clinical trials treating lung cancers. the present study evaluated the potential use of chlorin e – polyvinylpyrrolidone as a multimodality photosensitizer for fluorescence detection and photodynamic therapy on nsclc and sclc xenografts.  human nsclc and sclc tumor cell lines were used to establish tumor xenografts in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model as well as in the balb/c nude mice. in the cam model, ce6-pvp was applied topically and fluorescence intensity was charted at various time points. tumor-bearing mice were given intravenous administration of ce6-pvp and laser irradiation at nm. tumor response was evaluated at h post pdt. studies of temporal fluorescence pharmacokinetics in cam tumor xenografts showed that ce6-pvp has a selective localization and a good accuracy in demarcating nsclc compared to sclc from normal surrounding cam after h post drug administration. irradiation at h drug-light interval showed greater tumor necrosis against human nsclc xenografts in nude mice. sclc xenografts were observed to express resistance to photosensitization with ce6-pvp.  the formulation of ce6-pvp is distinctly advantageous as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent for fluorescence diagnosis and pdt of nsclc.

28," since multiple sequence alignments are the basis of many analyses, for example in phylogenetics or in analysing functional protein domains, there is a need for programs to create and improve those alignments. currently, several programs are available to fulfil these necessities, e.g., clustal w, muscle, dialign, t-coffee or dca all of which are able to align multiple sequences globally. the underlying methods have their strengths and weaknesses, and resulting alignments can diverge from the biologically correct ones. editors like jalview, seaview, cinema or align are needed to enhance the results by hand. the just mentioned tools are based on sequence information only, but in rna sequence analyses there is often also structural information available. databases like the its database provide a growing number of sequences and their known secondary structures, as a prerequisite for constructing rna alignments for inferring phylogenies, which of course is a precondition to understand the evolution of such rna secondary structures. all available methods that include structural information to build rna sequence alignments have a very high complexity. rfam provides a method to compare a single nucleotide query sequence to handcurated alignments of non-coding rna families with annotated consensus secondary structures. marna and rnaforester can be used to build global multiple alignments based on sequence and simultaneously on secondary structure information. however, the amount of sequences and/or sequence lengths is limited due to the complexity of their underlying algorithms, which is at least o. in current alignment editors like ralee, dcse or jphydit secondary structure information support is very limited. while ralee relys on the consensus structure only, jphydit just shows the pairing information of the selected sequence. another rna alignment editor called sarse has become available recently and focuses on detection and editing of structural groups in rna families. so there is no editor available to align both, sequence and secondary structure information of every single rna sequence simultaneously. implementation 4sale is entirely written in java, which enables to execute the software on any platform with a java virtual machine available. the application consists of two parts, the alignment algorithm, which is based on standard protein alignment algorithms, and the graphical editor frontend. for sequence and secondary structure alignments running on the local machine 4sale takes use of clustal w, so the binary is required to be installed. integration of different multiple alignment tools is realised by using soap based webservices. here, we take use of rnaforester, clustal w, dca or dialign. the dialign and dca webservices currently support sequence alignments without secondary structure information only. the webservice technology enables the user to run the tasks on remote machines. therefore, it is possible to use 4sale without restriction of any kind during the calculation of the alignment. all webservices require an internet connection.  supported data for rna sequence and secondary structure alignment and editing, 4sale reads vienna style dotbracket formatted files. the its database represents a good source for these kind of data. in addition we provide direct access to the its database from within 4sale through the its soap interface. while rna sequence information only is supported via the standard fasta format, alignment data can be loaded using the clustal importer. furthermore 4sale handles xml based rna formats namely rnastructml and rnastructalignmentml. standard features in addition to the secondary structure based functionality, 4sale integrates many useful features, that are known from other alignment editors/programs. this includes selecting multiple sections of an alignment to highlight interesting regions and temporarily hide sequences to focus on a subset of the alignment. sequence-motifs, including those, which are based on sequence and secondary structure information, can easily be highlighted by pattern matching. alignment column conservation based on sequence information is visualized by either sequence logos or simply by bars on top of each column. further importing, exporting and deleting sequences is possible by using the sequence names' context menu. additionally sequences can be reordered with the help of the ""rearrange sequences"" window. algorithm beside the integration of rnaforester we developed an algorithm that uses the secondary structure information of every single sequence to align multiple rna sequences. this algorihm inherits the complexity of those based on sequence information only. we achieve this by mapping the sequence and secondary structure information of every single rna sequence to artificial protein sequences. the algorithm can be described as string alignment on a letter alphabet comprised of the nucleotides in three structural states. horizontal dependencies given by the sequence bindings are not modeled by this approach. to align the string we use common alignment programs, like clustal w with a suitable scoring matrix. there are several substitution models for this kind of scoring matrices discussed, we used a model as described by. the model is based on subsitutions that were extracted from its sequence and secondary structure alignments. those sequences and their associated secondary structures were obtained from the its database. synchronous editing one of the main features of 4sale is synchronizing the sequence and secondary structure alignment, that is, every operation on the sequence alignment is also performed on the secondary structure alignment and vice versa. alignment editing in general works like in most alignment editors by using the space key to insert and the backspace key to remove gaps. block editing as an effect of not using horizontal dependencies in our greedy sequence and secondary structure alignment algorithm, there are often misaligned ""blocks"" in the result of clustal w. as shown in fig. 2e the alignment could be improved very fast, by using the block editing feature in 4sale. cursors to make editing as convenient as possible, we provide different edit cursors. beside the standard cursor, that behaves as you expect from text editors for example, we have an exclusive cursor, which performs the edit operation on every sequence but the selected ones. the leftside cursor allows edit operations only at the beginning of the sequence. as mentioned above all cursors perform synchronously on sequences and their secondary structures. working with secondary structures as current predictions of secondary structure information is not highly reliable, performing changes to correct the secondary structures is often needed. adding secondary structure information 4sale supports two methods to add secondary structure information to rna sequences. first, by using the remote folding feature to call the rnafold webservice provided by the university of bielefeld, or manually adding secondary structures by using the secondary structure editing feature. secondary structure editing the secondary structure editing mode available in 4sale allows easy modification of the secondary structure information. it is context sensitive, which means it uses sequence and secondary structure information to validate whether a binding in this context is possible or not. furthermore, it supports column based editing by holding the control key. this enables insertion and deletion of equivalent bindings in all sequences. in this case bindings are only added to sequences allowing this binding. secondary structure inspector a secondary structure inspector allows to view and select specific helical regions in secondary structures of loaded sequences. the inspector consists of two parts; the upper part shows a consensus of all secondary structures, the lower part shows all secondary structures separately. the secondary structure consensus is calculated not only on column conservation, but also with respect of horizontal dependencies, so the result is a valid secondary structure. the conservation threshold can be modified using the slider above. selecting an element in the inspector highlights the corresponding part in the alignment view. as shown in fig. the inspector simplifies visualizing misaligned sequences. ""masking"" the sequence alignment based on the current consensus structure is also possible. the result is shown in a new window, which contains the alignment based on sequence information only. the alignment can be processed like any other sequence alignment loaded in 4sale. this is particularly useful for calculating phylogenetic trees based on the collective helical regions in the sequence alignment. analyzing compensatory base changes compensatory base changes occur when both nucleotides of a paired site mutate while the pairing itself stays stable. cbc analysis is important in detecting species that are discriminated by their sexual incompatibility. we provide an easy-to-use cbc analysis mechanism with the ability to calculate cbc matrices on the current sequence and secondary structure based alignment. the numbers in the cbc matrix are the counts of compensatory base changes in a pairwise sequence structure alignment, which are naturally given in the considered multiple sequence structure alignment. a cbc-window in 4sale allows to select cbc counts between two sequences and highlights directly all cbcs within the alignment, giving an overview of all cbcs in the aligned sequences. output & connection to other tools for further analyses we provide several output formats. calculated cbc matrices can be saved as comma/tab seperated values to be used in cbcanalyzer. cbctree can be used to calculate phylogenetic trees based on a cbc count matrix. at present, no program is available to handle alignment outputs that include sequences and their individual secondary structures. however, for viewing purposes and publication we support a marna-like output. sequence alignments optimized by structural information could, of course, be saved separately. for phylogenetic analyses here we support the phylip formats. other tools that rely on multiple alignments are supported by fasta. discussion 4sale is the first alignment editor which allows synchronous editing of sequences and their corresponding secondary structures. since it is targeted on rna sequence alignment and editing it contains many features using the secondary structure information, e.g., the secondary structure inspector. all current standard alignment editors can handle secondary structures as character sequence only. by using standard greedy protein alignment algorithms we inherit their time efficiency. in contrast to, e.g., marna or rnaforester, the time complexity of calculation grows not rapidly with large files. we present a completely new approach using nucleotides and every single secondary structure for building and improving rna sequence alignments in comparison to others, which just take the consensus structure information. the structure output converted to vienna style dotbracket can be created from any desired rna folding program, e.g., rnafold, mfold or rnastructure. it is then aligned by using a suitable substitution matrix, which in our case is based on information of the its database. due to the natural limitation that two structures can be hidden in one sequence, in general only one will be considered by our approach. a future version of 4sale will integrate in addition to rnaforester more real structural alignment methods as webservices via the soap interface. also secondary structure prediction algorithms as an alternative to rnafold will be included. furthermore, more visualizations like secondary structure drawings can be implemented.  4sale is easy to use and has a fast ) and good heuristic to globally align multiple rna sequences and their associated secondary structures simultaneously. availability and requirements 4sale is freely available at. a java virtual machine is needed to run the application. furthermore, for automatic sequence and structure based alignments a local installation of clustal w and/or internet connection for webservice based alignments is required. list of abbreviations used cbc: compensatory base change its2: internal transcribed spacer 2 authors' contributions mw conceived the study. tm and mw provided the alignment algorithm. tm estimated the sequence and secondary structure substitution model and its associated score matrix. architecture, implementation and graphical design by ps. mw, ps and tm drafted the manuscript. mw, tm, js and td participated in study design and coordination. all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript. "," in sequence analysis the multiple alignment builds the fundament of all proceeding analyses. errors in an alignment could strongly influence all succeeding analyses and therefore could lead to wrong predictions. hand-crafted and hand-improved alignments are necessary and meanwhile good common practice. for rna sequences often the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-rna. recently, some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and model both kinds of information. however, with the advent of a large amount of reliable rna sequences together with their solved secondary structures, we are faced with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary structures synchronously.  4sale fills this gap. the application allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing of aligned sequences and their secondary structures. this study describes an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4sale used for further analyses and editing. 4sale builds an optimal and unique starting point for every rna sequence and structure analysis.  4sale, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for rna analysis based on sequence and secondary structure information. the program connects sequence and structure databases like the its database to phylogeny programs as for example the cbcanalyzer. 4sale is written in java and therefore platform independent. the software is freely available and distributed from the website at ",fa00508d-4402-4590-b1e2-f52eefd623a6,pubmed
29," in the last decade, cancer treatment has seen a shift from a ""one size fits all"" philosophy to a more personalized approach. technical advances allow for the assessment of complex genetic defects and pathway aberrations, enabling refined cancer classification and treatment prediction based on molecular rather than histological features. gene expression profiling has been used to classify patient samples as being benign or malignant or to classify them into cancer subclasses. lately, molecular profiling of cancer samples has been applied to the prediction of drug sensitivity. drug-sensitive samples have been compared to drug-resistant samples to build ""drug sensitivity profiles"", statistical models built from a defined set of genes whose differential expression in a cell line may confer sensitivity to a drug. thus, cancer cell lines whose gene expression patterns are similar to the genes in the sensitivity profile will have a higher probability of responding to the drug. it has been demonstrated that gene expression profiling can refine the prediction of drug response to targeted drug therapies. for example, harris et al. used gene expression profiling to identify lists of genes that are potential predictors of response to herceptin and vinorelbine in her2-positive breast cancers. another study used the coxen algorithm to build sensitivity profiles for the drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. the profiles were subsequently used to predict drug response in bladder and breast cancer samples. of particular interest is the fact that these samples were not part of the original anti-cancer cancer panel, showing that drug sensitivity profiles generated from the screen can be generalized to any tumor sample. approaches such as coxen make use of comprehensive pharmacogenomic resources to derive drug sensitivity profiles. coxen was applied to the nci- anti-cancer screen, which tested > compounds on cancer cell lines, all of which have been profiled for genome-wide gene expression. sensitivity profiles for the compounds in the screen can be generated by comparing gene expression values of sensitive and resistant cell lines. the coxen algorithm can only generate profiles for compounds that are part of an anti-cancer drug screen. if a drug was not tested as part of the nci- dataset, its sensitivity profile cannot be generated. updating an existing cancer screen with the latest available or experimental drugs is a non-trivial issue, and requires the same expertise, infrastructure and conditions as when the screen was established the first time around. in this work, we present a method to predict responses to drugs that are not part of available anti-cancer screens. we propose to find substitute sensitivity profiles for these untested drugs by using structural similarity. it has been known that the structure of a compound is related to its activity. shi et al. performed an analysis where compounds were clustered based on activity across cancer cell lines. they found that compounds with similar structures clustered together. several other studies have been performed to show that specific classes of compounds have similar activity patterns across cancer cell lines. therefore, it can be hypothesized that structurally similar compounds have similar activities and might affect the same pathways. in other words, the sensitivity pattern for drug a might be similar to that of drug b if drug a and drug b are structurally similar. we are interested in extending this idea to test whether the drug sensitivity profiles of a structural analogue of a drug can be used as a substitute when predicting its response in cancer cell lines.  to analyze whether a structural analogue of a drug can be used to predict its response, two questions need to be answered. the first question is whether two structurally similar drugs have the same sensitivity pattern across the nci- cancer cell lines. secondly, even if we can show that there is a strong association between structural similarity and drug sensitivity, we need to test whether the correlation is strong enough to be of any practicality. the second question we would like to ask is whether the sensitivity profile of drug a be used to predict activity of drug b without a significant loss of accuracy, if drug a and drug b are structurally similar. we investigated whether this proposition holds only for compounds in the same chemical family, or also for compounds that are similar but from different families. structural similarity and response similarity in nci- cancer cell lines the first question we set out to address was whether two structurally similar drugs have the same sensitivity pattern across cancer cell lines in an anti-cancer screen, even when the mechanisms of action or the classes of the compounds might not be known. we used the tanimoto coefficient between pairs of compounds as the structural similarity measure. in figure we show pairs of compounds ordered by their tanimoto structural similarity coefficients, and the similarity between their responses across the cancer cell lines. the similarity between responses was measured as the percentage of cell lines that elicited the same response to both the compounds. as the tanimoto coefficient increases, the similarity between the cell line responses increases too. this supports the hypothesis that if two compounds are structurally similar, their sensitivity patterns in the nci- data are similar too. this can be interpreted in the following manner: two structurally similar drugs may bind similar cellular structures, and activate or inhibit similar cellular pathways, and therefore share a common cause of resistance. we next set out to investigate the practical implications of this finding. predictive power of sensitivity profiles of structurally similar drugs the second question we wanted to ask is whether we can use one drug as a substitute to perform gene-expression-based sensitivity prediction for another drug. in this scenario, we take advantage of an existing anti-cancer screen, such as the nci- to construct a sensitivity profile for a drug a, and use it as a substitute profile for another drug b. specifically, we wanted to see what the loss of accuracy in response prediction would be if the sensitivity profile was constructed from a drug with high structural similarity. using a cross-validation setup within the nci- data set, we could measure the change in prediction accuracy when using drug b's sensitivity profile compared to using a substitute profile generated from drugs a with various levels of structural similarity to b. families of compounds in our dataset to ensure that not all structurally similar pairs of compounds in our dataset belonged to the same family, we identified pairs of compounds with tanimoto coefficients higher than we were able to extract several pairs of interest where the compounds did not belong to the same family. figure shows derivatives of camptothecin along with amino acid derivatives clustered together in a visualization of the compounds in our dataset. comparing their activity patterns in nci- we found that both classes exhibited exactly the same activity across the cell lines. both camptothecins and amino-acid derivatives have been known to have anti-neoplastic activities, but we couldn't find any evidence in the literature of the amino acid derivatives inhibiting topoisomerase i. the above example shows that while the pairs of compounds might belong to different functional or mechanistic families, structural similarities highly correlate with their cellular responses.  cancer patients need access to the latest decision criteria given an increasing number of highly specific and targeted anti-cancer drugs. it is believed that the pre-treatment cellular state is predictive of whether a cancer cell is going to respond to a particular drug. functional anti-cancer drug screens give access to pre-treatment gene expression states from sensitive and resistant cancer cells, and are useful in deriving drug sensitivity profiles that can be applied to independent cancer samples. one major limitation of this approach is that profiles can only be generated for drugs that have been tested in anti-cancer screens. in our work, we addressed the issue of deriving sensitivity profiles for untested drugs for which we do not have response information across a number of cell lines. for those drugs, we examined the possibility of using substitute drug sensitivity profiles from structurally similar drugs that have been tested in the screen. we established that it is indeed true that structural similarity is highly correlated with sensitivity across cancer cell lines. we have also shown that for structurally related drugs, the use of substitute sensitivity profiles is likely to result in response predictions similar to using a drug's own profile in the first place. our study may thus be helpful in increasing the relevance of existing screens, by expanding their use to other drugs with high structural similarity. since not all new cancer drugs are immediately tested in anti-cancer screens, our approach ultimately increases the number of drugs for which patient response can be predicted. a drawback of the current study is the small number of drugs that we could include in our analysis, i.e. drugs that showed sufficient variation across cell lines. this introduces some bias that may favor pairs of compounds in the same class and with high similarity in activity patterns. nonetheless, the above experiments demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between structural similarity and drug sensitivity in the nci- cancer cell lines. in terms of future work, we want to explore the following issues. first, we want to fine-tune our sensitivity profile generating algorithm, in order to increase the prediction accuracy when using a compound's own profile. second, we want to explore other structural similarity measures to ensure that we indeed identify the closest structural pairs among the nci- compounds. third, we want to investigate other similarity measures that can identify an analogue for sensitivity profile substitution. "," the ability to predict drug sensitivity in cancer is one of the exciting promises of pharmacogenomic research. several groups have demonstrated the ability to predict drug sensitivity by integrating chemo-sensitivity data and associated gene expression measurements from large anti-cancer drug screens such as nci- the general approach is based on comparing gene expression measurements from sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and deriving drug sensitivity profiles consisting of lists of genes whose expression is predictive of response to a drug. importantly, it has been shown that such profiles are generic and can be applied to cancer cell lines that are not part of the anti-cancer screen. however, one limitation is that the profiles can not be generated for untested drugs. in this work, we propose using an existing drug sensitivity profile for drug a as a substitute for an untested drug b given high structural similarities between drugs a and b.  we first show that structural similarity between pairs of compounds in the nci- dataset highly correlates with the similarity between their activities across the cancer cell lines. this result shows that structurally similar drugs can be expected to have a similar effect on cancer cell lines. we next set out to test our hypothesis that we can use existing drug sensitivity profiles as substitute profiles for untested drugs. in a cross-validation experiment, we found that the use of substitute profiles is possible without a significant loss of prediction accuracy if the substitute profile was generated from a compound with high structural similarity to the untested compound.  anti-cancer drug screens are a valuable resource for generating omics-based drug sensitivity profiles. we show that it is possible to extend the usefulness of existing screens to untested drugs by deriving substitute sensitivity profiles from structurally similar drugs part of the screen. 15– march amia summit on translational bioinformatics san francisco, ca, usa ",58ee1983-a741-43c0-a354-1990acf81235,pubmed
30," cellular responses to internal and external signals are mediated by the expression of specific genes or sets of genes, which are regulated by specific transcriptional factors. therefore, the entry of transcription factors into the nucleus is critical to their role in gene expression. signals from cytokines and growth factors are transduced into the nucleus by the janus kinase -signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway. jak-stat signaling is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, motility, and apoptosis in different organs. the binding of signal molecules to their receptors initiates activation of jaks, which increases their tyrosine kinase activity. the activated jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor, which turns into a binding site for proteins that contain phosphotyrosine-binding src homology domains such as stats. the stats bound to the phosphorylated receptor are then tyrosine-phosphorylated by jaks. these phosphorylated stats act as docking sites for other stats, which results in dimerization. activated stat dimers accumulate in the nucleus, bind to consensus dna-recognition motifs in the promoter regions of cytokine-inducible genes, and activate transcription of these genes. stats are also activated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as v-src and receptor tyrosine kinases such as growth factor receptors. there are seven distinct stats in mammals that participate in jak-stat signal transduction with different jaks. stat and are expressed mainly in specific cell types and participate predominantly in host defense mechanisms; stat is critical for interferon function and innate immunity. for example, stat is selectively stimulated by ifn-gamma which has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties. in mice lacking stat all physiological functions associated with ifns are absent, leading to a remarkable sensitivity to viral infections and other pathological agents. this important physiological activity of stat is expected to be conserved in fishes. indeed, ectopic expression of the zebrafish stat rescues ifn-induced signaling in a stat1-deficient human cell line, indicating that the ifn/stat1-dependent signaling pathway in mammals might be functionally and structurally conserved in fishes. in support of this, hirame rhabdovirus -infected olive flounder have leukocytes with upregulated levels of mrna for the components of the ifn/stat1-dependent signaling pathway, such as interferon-inducible k protein, cef- and stat. recently, flounder interleukin- ifn-alpha, ifn-beta, and type- cytokine receptors were cloned and characterized, which suggest the presence of stat genes in this fish. in addition, a number of cytokines and growth factors have been cloned, and their activities have been successfully detected in rainbow trout and carp. however, limited information is available on stat in edible fishes, despite recent efforts to understand ifn-mediated anti-viral activity in fish. in this study, we present for the first time the cloning and expression analysis of a olive flounder stat  amplification of the sh domain the stat molecule can be divided into seven functional domains: an n-domain responsible for dimer-dimer interactions, a coiled-coil domain responsible for protein-protein interactions, a dna-binding domain, a linker domain implicated in transcription, an sh domain responsible for receptor binding and dimerization, a tyrosine phosphorylation site, and a transcriptional activation domain. among these seven domains, the sh domain shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity between various species and between stat families. for example, the stat sh domains of human and zebrafish show 82% identity. this structural conservation of the stat sh domain in different species prompted us to clone stat from p. olivaceus. first we constructed three degenerative pcr primers that represent three highly conserved peptide sequences within the sh domains of zebrafish and human stat and conducted degenerative pcr reactions. the strategy for degenerative pcr used in the experiments is depicted in fig. 1c. pcr product of bp and bp were obtained from first round and second round pcr reaction, respectively. as a control, parallel pcr experiments were conducted with zebrafish cdna, and we obtained a similar result, a ~450-bp pcr product, with the same primers used for flounder. these results strongly suggest that the 800-bp pcr product encodes a partial sequence of flounder stat to confirm that the nested pcr product is flounder stat we cloned and sequenced the pcr product. the cloned cdna was bp and contained sequences that perfectly matched with the primers. complete sequence of the flounder stat1 the complete cdna of the flounder stat gene was compiled by overlapping the sequences of the cloned cdna and the 5'-race and 3'-race pcr products. the flounder stat transcript consisted of bp, which translated into a 749-amino acid open reading frame that included an 103-bp 5'-untranslated region and a 556-bp 3'-utr. the assembled full-length cdna sequence was entered in genbank under accession number ef the flounder stat protein is the same size as that of zebrafish, similar to that of rainbow trout, and larger than that of crucian carp, which is missing aa at the c-terminal end. the flounder stat protein contains the conserved domains of stat proteins; the n-terminal domain, coiled-coiled domain, dna binding domain, a linker, sh domain, and the transcriptional activation domain. the deduced flounder sequence contains a conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site in the c-terminal activation domain. in addition, it contains the -e422e- and -v451vv- residues that are involved in dna binding activity, -p719msp for serine phosphorylation, and the arginine residue that is required for sh phosphotyrosine binding. the amino acid sequence of the putative flounder stat was compared to known stats from different species. the overall similarity between the flounder stat and other stats was very high; snakehead stat showed the highest identity and similarity at the amino acid level. crucian carp stat showed the lowest 61% identity and 77% similarity. figure shows the phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequence similarity. flounder stat belonged to the same monophyletic group as snakehead stat. zebrafish stat and human stat were also included in the same monophyletic group. these results strongly indicate that the cloned dna in this study indeed encodes the ortholog of flounder stat we also note that the flounder stat sh domain has been well conserved, and that it should play similar roles regulating stat activity. as mentioned previously, zebrafish stat can compensate for human stat in inducing ifn-mediated signaling pathways in stat1-deficient human cell lines. because zebrafish and flounder stat have very high similarity, we expect that flounder stat also plays important roles in ifn-mediated immune activity in flounder. avalues are given as percentages. northern blot analysis of flounder stat genes we examined the mrna expression of flounder stat by northern blot analyses. as a control, zebrafish total rna was analyzed using zebrafish stat cdna as a probe. as shown in fig. 4a, we detected bands of approximately and kb. according to a previous report, the former corresponds to stat and the latter to stat in zebrafish. cross-reactivity of stat with stat mrna is possible because the probe was derived from a 465-bp pcr fragment from the conserved sh domain, which has % nucleotide sequence identity between stat and stat. similarly, we examined stat expression in flounder and observed a single ~3-kb message, which is almost the same size as the zebrafish stat. considering the high sequence similarity in the sh domain of zebrafish stat and stat we expected see an mrna band for stat but did not detect another band. although seven stat genes have been identified in mammals, only stat stat and stat have been identified in zebrafish, stat in rainbow trout and crucian carp, and stat in pufferfish. in zebrafish, only cdna clones containing stat were detected using a probe derived from stat the presence of different forms of stat genes in other fish but failure in the detection of stat with the conserved sh domain probe in flounder suggests the possibility of finding more stat genes in flounder with low nucleotide sequence similarity. expression of flounder stat in different tissues and developmental stages some stats, including stat are expressed in early stages of development, and null mutants for stat in mice are embryonic lethal. in contrast, stat in vertebrates is dispensable for normal development. early expression of mouse stat has been detected only in endothelial cells of decidual vasculature and decidual cells, which indicates maternal expression of this gene. similarly, zebrafish stat gene expression was not detected by in situ hybridization before days post-fertilization. as shown in fig. 5a, flounder stat expression could be detected in all developmental stages, including the fertilized egg. also, expression of stat increased in accordance with development. increased mouse stat expression has been observed from postnatal day to adulthood in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. in our experiment, total rna was extracted from fertilized eggs and later developmental stages. therefore, the site of stat expression could not be determined and needs to be further characterized. there are many reports of stat expression in different tissues or cells of vertebrates, but studies of expression of fish stat proteins in different tissues are limited. sung et al. observed the same expression of stat in different tissues. we analyzed the expression of flounder stat mrna using quantitative real time rt-pcr and in situ hybridization. as shown in fig. 5b, flounder stat was expressed in all tested tissues. however, there was a difference in expression level; expression was low in the liver, skin, and muscle, whereas it was high in the gill, spleen and kidney. this was further confirmed by in situ hybridization, which showed high expression of stat mrna in the gill, spleen and kidney. the tissues probed with sh domain probe showed blue appearance and there was no ""hot spot"" of stat expression in these tissues, and stat expression was detected in most cells in these tissues. stat is involved in signaling pathways initiated by both ifn-α/β and ifn-γ, which are important to innate antiviral responses and adaptive cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. in both, stat is in an inactivated latent form in the cytoplasm and is activated by binding of ifns to their receptors. therefore, basal expression of stat is necessary for a prompt response to a signal. for example, higher basal expression of stat and stat in cardiac myocytes results in higher antiviral protection. the gill is the front line of defense when fish encounter foreign substances, including pathogenic microorganisms. therefore, high expression of stat is necessary for prompt and efficient innate immune responses. similarly, spleen and kidney play important roles in the adaptive immune response of fish, and high expression of stat can be expected. our results indicate that flounder stat is expressed throughout development and that tissue with high stat expression are involved in defense against pathogens.  flounder is one of the main edible fishes in asia and is also one of the most lucrative fishes in marine culture. however, many problems hamper the mass production of flounder through high-density culture. in particular, frequent mass mortality induced by viral and bacterial infections causes serious damage to the flounder industry. therefore, biological research on the immune system of flounder is highly important, not only for academic purposes but also for commercial and industrial purposes. we cloned flounder stat and found that the sh domain is conserved. our results suggest that flounder may use the highly specialized jak-stat pathway for cytokine signaling. further identification of ifn and isoforms of stat proteins will provide more detail about the signaling and immune responses of this economically important fish. "," signal transducer and activator of transcription is a critical component of interferon -alpha/beta and ifn-gamma signaling. although seven isoforms of stat proteins have been reported from mammals, limited information is available for the stat genes in fish. we isolated complementary dna with high similarity to mammalian stat from the olive flounder, paralichthys olivaceus.  a dna fragment containing the conserved sh domain was amplified by rt-pcr using degenerate primers designed based on the highly conserved sequences in the sh domains of the zebrafish and mammalian stat the complete cdna sequence was obtained by 5' and 3' race. the flounder stat transcript consisted of bp that encoded a polypeptide of amino acids. the overall similarity between flounder stat and other stats was very high, with the highest amino acid sequence identity to snakehead. phylogenetic analyses reveal that flounder stat is in the same monophyletic group with snakehead stat quantitative real time rt-pcr and in situ hybridization revealed that stat was expressed in almost all examined organs and tissues, with high expression in gill, spleen, kidney, and heart. the accumulation of stat mrna in different developmental stages, as determined by real time rt-pcr, increased with development.  recent cloning of various cytokine genes and the stat gene of olive flounder here suggest that fish also use the highly specialized jak-stat pathway for cytokine signaling. identification of other stat genes will elucidate in detail the signal transduction system in this fish.

31," the amount of biomedical data stored in public databases has grown extensively in the last couple of decades and will most likely continue to increase just as rapidly in the coming years. however, for researchers to make optimal use of this large amount of information, it has to be structured and annotated in such a way that data from different labs, different instruments and even of different types can be compared and analyzed efficiently. data must therefore be annotated using precisely defined terms agreed upon by all data providers. with this requirement in mind, controlled vocabularies and ontologies have been created. a cv is defined as a limited list of clearly defined terms, with optional relationships between the terms, while an ontology moves beyond a mere cv by attempting to extensively model a part of the real world. but even though systems for annotating biomedical data in consistent ways are available, finding and using the correct cv terms to annotate a data set may in some cases be a difficult task. partly as a response to this the ontology lookup service was created. the ols provides interactive and programmatic interfaces to query, browse and navigate a long list of biomedical ontologies, thus making it easier to find the desired cv terms. however, using the ols as a web service is not always feasible, especially for researchers without bioinformatics support. we have therefore created a java front end to the ols, called the ols dialog http://ols-dialog.googlecode.com, which can be plugged into any application requiring the annotation of data using cv terms, making it straightforward to find and use cv terms without requiring any additional knowledge about web services or ontology formats. implementation the ols dialog has been implemented in java, is platform independent and requires java. as the name suggests, the ols dialog is implemented as a java dialog, which depends on a parent frame or dialog. selected terms are communicated to this parent through the olsinputable interface, defined in the package no.uib.olsdialog. this interface contains two simple methods that fully represent the interaction of the ols dialog with its parent. platform independent java binaries, additional documentation and source code are freely available at http://ols-dialog.googlecode.com. ols dialog is released under the permissive apache license http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-.html allowing for easy reuse of the code and tool in other settings.  four different cv term search strategies are supported in the ols dialog: term name search, locates a cv term by a match to a search term; term id search, locates a cv term by its cv term accession number; psi-mod mass search, finds the cv term for a modification in the psi-mod ontology using the mass of the modification; and browse ontology, browses the ontology as a tree structure and allows the user to locate the desired term. furthermore, ols dialog also provides a term hierarchy graph view that can be used to locate or verify a cv term by inspecting the term hierarchy. note that the term name search supports both fuzzy/partial searches and synonym searches. the main interface of the ols dialog is split into three main parts. at the top, the desired ontology is selected. at the time of writing more than different biomedical ontologies are supported in the ols, including over cv terms. a full list of the supported ontologies can be found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols. these ontologies are constantly updated and maintained by specialists in the various fields, and new changes will be automatically picked up daily by the ols. it is important to note that the ols dialog does not store the ontologies locally but accesses the ols web service whenever a search is performed. this ensures that the latest versions of the ontologies are always used. in addition to searching a specific ontology it is also possible to search in all ontologies at once by selecting'search in all ontologies' at the top of the list. this makes it possible to locate a cv term for which the ontology is unknown. searching in all ontologies slows down the search however, and is not the recommended standard search option. below the ontology selection there are four tabs, one for each search option. although each tab provides a search-specific interface, the overall structure stays the same. the search parameters are inserted or selected at the top of the tab, and the results of the search, i.e., the matching cv terms, are inserted into the'search results' table. by selecting a cv term in the results table the term's associated details will be presented in the'term details' table. the browse ontology tab is slightly different, as it replaces the'search results' table with a tree structure of all terms in the currently selected ontology. it is also possible to view the term hierarchy as a graph by clicking the'view term hierarchy' link at the top of the'term details' text area. when a cv term is selected in the table clicking the'use selected term' sends the selected term to the parent frame or dialog. for examples of how the ols dialog can be used, see figure and in figure term name search is used to find the possible cv terms for the search term'oxidation', while in figure the same term is found using psi-mod mass search. figure shows how the browse ontology feature can be used to locate the term'go:001250'. to display how the ols dialog can be used in other projects we have implemented a simple application, ols_example, located in the no.uib.olsdialog.example package. to run the example, download and unzip the ols dialog and double click the jar file. more details can be found at the ols dialog web page: http://ols-dialog.googlecode.com.  the ols dialog greatly simplifies the usage of the ols in end-user tools, without requiring any additional knowledge about web services or ontology formats, making it much easier to annotate data using cv terms. the ols dialog has already been in use for quite some time in pride converter for annotating mass spectrometry data. we believe that many other tools could also benefit from the usage of the ols dialog, and that this could increase the usage of cv terms for annotating data, which ultimately makes these data even more valuable to the biomedical community. availability and requirements project name: ols dialog project home page: http://ols-dialog.googlecode.com operating system: platform independent programming language: java other requirements: java or newer license: apache license http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-.html any restrictions to use by non-academics: none list of abbreviations cv: controlled vocabulary;

32," most verbs describe events with one or more participants. the verb's argument structure defines the number and relationships of participants needed for a complete event. for ""peter gives jim a book"", linguistic theorizing would ascribe participants three thematic roles: the agent, the recipient and the theme. the entry in the mental lexicon for a verb like ""give"" must incorporate such information in addition to phonetic and orthographic information. the cortical processing of argument structures has been investigated mostly in designs employing entire sentences, wh-questions, or sentences including syntactic or semantic violations. imaging studies suggest that the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere play a crucial role in this processing. in particular, the left ifg has been shown to be active when grammatically complex sentences that required working memory resources, and when argument hierarchies were processed. even if words were presented in the grammatically correct order in one, and out of order in another condition, activation of the left ifg and mtg was more pronounced to words in correct sentences. complementing this research on sentence processing, the present study examined whether the verb's argument structure was already retrieved with the verb itself. for this purpose, electromagnetic brain responses to verbs of different argument structure, presented in isolation, were assessed. as an alternative, the information about argument structure might be retrieved only in context, so that the brain response discloses the relation between argument structures and their fillers. this option was examined in a second experiment by measuring the electromagnetic brain responses to verbs that varied in their argument structure and were presented in a minimal syntactic context. compared to full-sentence designs and isolated verb presentation, a minimal context should prevent influences of other words and structures within a sentence, and hence disclose the extent to which relatively small differences in the lexical entry can be traced in the brain response. retrieval of the argument structure from the verb itself has been suggested by behavioral studies, which reported faster responses to two-compared to three-argument verbs. but it has also been argued that context is required to activate syntactic processing. this, too, is supported by faster responses to verbs related to nouns relative to unrelated verbs, by faster responses whenever two-compared to three-argument verbs had to be integrated into sentences, and by faster responses to words following verbs with one compared to three participant roles. an impact of context can also be concluded from distinct activation including the left ifg after sentences. for the present study, we selected verbs with one, two, or three obligatory arguments. if isolated verbs activated the processing of their argument structure, more pronounced activation by the more complex relative to the simple argument structure were to be expected mainly in left anterior/middle temporal areas. this hypothesis was examined in a first experiment, in which isolated verbs with different argument structure were presented visually. the second experiment served to explore the impact of the verb's context. if presentation of the verb was sufficient for the retrieval of its argument structure, and if context was needed to activate syntactic processing, would the minimal context of just one noun be sufficient to activate this processing? if so, name-verb pairs with different argument structures should evoke different cortical response patterns. we hypothesized that the minimal context should start the evaluation automatically, whether or not the verb completed a grammatically correct sentence. only for one-argument verbs, the name completes a sentence. if a minimal context would activate the same processing as an entire sentence, left ifg activation distinguishing the conditions was to be expected.  experiment 1 around 250– ms, one-argument verbs led to the strongest activation in the left temporal lobe, while three-argument verbs produced the weakest activation, and activation by two-argument verbs were in between =, p =; figure 1). between and ms activity did not vary between verbs. experiment 2 similar to experiment activity around 250– ms in the left temporal lobe was most pronounced to one-argument verbs. however, the linear trend was not significant. =, p = ). between and ms, activity varied in amplitude and latency in the region of the inferior frontal gyrus when a name preceded the verb. a linear trend confirmed larger amplitudes for one- than for two- and three-argument verbs =, p = ) when verbs were presented in minimal syntactic contexts of names. moreover, activity peaked significantly earlier when the name-verb pair formed a complete, and thus grammatically correct sentence compared to pairs forming incomplete sentences =, p =, post-hoc comparison one- vs two-argument verbs: f =, p =; for one- versus three-argument verbs: f =, p =; for two- vs three-argument verbs: n.s.). discussion two results of the present study seem noteworthy: verbs of different argument structure differentially activate cortical areas in the left middle temporal lobe, the distinct processing being reflected in electromagnetic response patterns as early as ms after stimulus onset. whenever verbs were presented in combination with a name, and were thus processed within a minimal context, an additional later and more anterior activation in the left hemisphere showed the same differentiation by the verb's argument structure as the earlier one. from the projection of mne onto a standard anatomical brain, we may assume that the first activation involves the middle temporal gyrus, while the second activation might involve areas like the ifg and broca's area. thus, these structures may participate in this analysis of argument structure in syntax processing. further support of this anatomical relationship and the significance of the ifg is drawn from recent imaging results obtained from a similar experimental design, which disclosed the ifg and the left mtg as primary areas distinguishing conditions. both results suggest that the processing of a verb's argument structure is linked to the verb itself and does not require a complete sentence. moreover, the differential activation that is even evoked by the minimal context of a name suggests that a major impact of working memory can be ruled out. activation in the middle temporal gyrus followed a linear trend. this, too, indicates the activation of argument structure by verbs independent of any participants. mcrae and coworker found a priming effect even under conditions when the subject followed the verb, which is a rare construction in every day english. thus, a verb can indeed activate the argument structure even if the filler is not provided. in the active anterior region, this linear trend was only evident when verbs were preceded by names. this suggests that the ifg is involved in keeping representations active and in integrating them with further incoming representations. in line with this hypothesis mcdermott and colleagues point out that broca's area is not only active during processing of syntax but also involved in semantic tasks. there is also evidence that larger parts of the left inferior frontal gyrus are involved in syntactic processing. activation during semantic processing has consistently been found in left inferior frontal areas. specifically, a region in the anterior and ventral aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus has been identified as contributing to semantic processing, in addition to the left middle temporal cortex. thus, we may conclude that the ifg projects back to the temporal lobe to keep representations active. such a structure would allow for lexical items to interact when coming in sequentially: the activation of typical fillers is supposed to facilitate on-line language processing. verbs have been demonstrated to prime typical fillers of agent, patient and instrument roles and vice versa. sentential information, structurally crucial to a verb, facilitates integration of the verb into the sentence. as a consequence, reading is accelerated when thematic roles are saturated during comprehension. in the present study, processing speed distinguished the automatic evaluation of verbs requiring one argument as grammatically completing a sentence from the evaluation of verbs requiring two or three arguments as leaving an incomplete, grammatically incorrect sentence. the interplay between ifg and middle temporal gyrus may be the biological substrate for these priming effects. the assumption that sequential processing of lexical items is reflected in distinct spatio-temporal brain activation patterns fits with theoretical models: for instance, rappaport and colleagues assume that a verb activates an intermediate representation, the semantic class. the semantic class provides the list of lexical conceptual structures and associated argument structures defining different argument structures and roles. the activation of the semantic class may involve allocation of memory for the upcoming syntactic structure of the sentence. it is conceivable that the amount of memory allocation depends on the complexity of the expected sentence and, hence, on the verb's argument structure. it has been suggested that the number of thematic roles is related to the processing load which is required for the integration of single words into sentences, and that the inferior frontal gyrus is involved in the transient storage of information during parsing. stromswold and colleagues reported increased regional cerebral blood flow in broca's area, particularly in the pars opercularis, when subjects judged the semantic plausibility of syntactically more relative to less complex sentences. this suggests that the activation of broca's area may vary with the complexity of the sentence. in contrast to previous evidence and our expectation, more verb arguments did not provoke more activation. instead, decreasing activation with increasing complexity in argument structure was found. a similar result was also obtained in our recent fmri study using different stimuli and a different experimental setup. this result may indicate that activation reflects integration rather than processing demands imposed by the verb. within the composition of words into a sentence, the completeness of the compositional representation of words may vary across the parsing process, and may be accompanied by a sequence of activation. before the first word is presented, sentence processing is 0% complete, and activation has not started. activation starts with word/verb presentation, with retrieval of the verb describing the situation being of highest impact. while the recognition of simple events is 50% complete, the recognition of complex events may be less complete. thus, we may assume that the representation of an event is more likely activated by a verb with few arguments. finally, event representation composition is complete when all parts are given. this is the case for one-argument verbs when they are presented together with names. although speculative, this model would explain the differential activation in the temporal lobe as reflecting the degree to which event retrieval is complete, with activity being higher for one- than for three-argument verbs. semantic complexity, examined for eventive and stative verbs, has been found to affect processing time. completion of the event's representation may have been reflected by the peak of activity in ifg. the parser may be waiting for further input in the other cases. behavioral studies have shown that appropriate versus inappropriate syntactic context can affect a target word's naming latency or lexical decision time or both. similar timing can be reflected prior to overt reaction, i.e. in the latency of peak amplitudes of the brain response to the word in context. many studies on word frequency effects reported shorter peak latencies of brain responses corresponding to shorter reaction times. in the present study, the earlier amplitude in correct phrases may be a signature of a sentence's end similar to the eeg findings of a late positivity following the last word of a grammatical sentence.  in sum, the present results suggest that sub-representations of entries in the mental lexicon are processed along a dimension of complexity. this processing evolves over time and occurs in the brain along a posterior-anterior axis: whereas recognition of the visual items activated posterior brain areas around ms after stimulus onset without distinct processing of item features, the argument structure inherent in a verb was automatically distinguished at some ms latency in the middle temporal lobe, followed by the automatic appraisal of the grammaticality of the verb presented in minimal context at some ms latency in more frontal areas, presumably the ifg. "," a verb's argument structure defines the number and relationships of participants needed for a complete event. one-argument verbs require only a subject to make a complete sentence, while two- and three-argument verbs normally take direct and indirect objects. cortical responses to verbs embedded into sentences indicate the processing of the verb's argument structure in the human brain. the two experiments of the present study examined whether and how this processing is reflected in distinct spatio-temporal cortical response patterns to isolated verbs and/or verbs presented in minimal context.  the magnetoencephalogram was recorded while native german-speaking adults saw german verbs, presented one at a time for ms each in experiment verb-evoked electromagnetic responses at – ms after stimulus onset, analyzed in source space, were higher in the left middle temporal gyrus for verbs that take only one argument, relative to two- and three-argument verbs. in experiment the same verbs were preceded by a proper name specifying the subject of the verb. this produced additional activation between and ms in or near the left inferior frontal gyrus, activity being larger and peaking earlier for one-argument verbs that required no further arguments to form a complete sentence.  localization of sources of activity suggests that the activation in temporal and frontal regions varies with the degree by which representations of an event as a part of the verbs' semantics are completed during parsing.

33," development of high throughput transcription profiling techniques such as microarrays and sage has made it possible to evaluate the expression levels of genes on a genome wide scale. the ability to look at expression profiles of different cellular states has the potential to provide knowledge about the mechanisms driving such important events as differentiation, aging and tumorogenesis. in addition to understanding transcription profiles of individual genes, the ability to visualize relationships between whole sets of gene expression data provides the means to infer higher-order relationships between the sampled biological conditions. in this paper, we describe the design and usage of an interactive viewer, which builds hypothetical phenetic networks from sage expression data. these networks may help to associate analyzed sage libraries with some intermediate stages in the development of different cellular states or progress of disease, such as cancer. as an example, we have used our program to analyze publicly available sage data, but our application is also applicable to microarray data analysis. implementation and  traditionally, hierarchical data are presented as a rooted or unrooted tree with bifurcating branches connecting different data points. generally, only the distances along the edges of the tree are shown proportionally. in a non-reticulated tree, the distance between nodes that are not directly connected is not easily visualized or understood. building a hierarchical tree benefits by operating in 3-dimensional space, as such 3-dimensional structure provides more details about the relationships between the analyzed datasets. the algorithm of building phenetic networks or dendrograms, which we have used for our viewer, is generally applied in systematic biology. for systematic analysis, tree-building techniques are designed to order data in terms of phylogenetic relationships, from which evolutionary history can be inferred. in contrast, system analysis of sage and microarray data assumes that extraction of order in the relationships between different gene expression profiles and presents clues about biological processes and functions on molecular, cellular and tissue levels. systematic approaches may allow improvement of diagnosis, disease classification, and prognosis, as well as assist in drug design, among other scientific and medical goals. we have developed a graphical viewer for analysis of the hierarchical organization of cellular expression profiles, analyzed by sage or microarray experiments. the output diagram is a system of nodes, each of which represents a sage or microarray experiment, and the connections between nodes in the diagram. for each node, the relative position on the graph depends on the differences between its expression profile and the expression profiles of the other analyzed nodes. in order to generate the diagram, the user can choose a distance metric to generate the comparison. our viewer currently offers five distance metrics, all having a different approach to the estimation of the distance between expression profiles. these metrics include euclidean, manhattan, pearson and pearson squared distances. in addition, we have implemented a generic,'quantitative' metric, which calculates distance as a ratio of the number of differently expressed genes to the number of similarly expressed genes the application loads the data from plain tab-delimited text files. currently, we provide support for two formats – generic, tab-delimited with optional tags for description and total number of tags in a sage library and geo. format of compatible files is shown in figure the calculation of distances is performed via a pairwise analysis, so the distance value is calculated for each possible pair of sage or microarray experiments. in all five cases the values are normalized and put into an array, which is used to draw the graph. this array, or'distance matrix' may be exported as a plain text file. our viewer automatically positions the analyzed nodes in 3d-space according to the calculated distances between them. in comparison to traditional phenetic techniques, mostly generating 2d-diagrams, this approach has several advantages. the constraints imposed by 2d-space are removed, so it is possible to get a more adequate snapshot of the system relationships between datasets. the nodes are connected, and by default it is possible to change the visibility for the connecting edges, adjusting the threshold for maximal length to be shown. in addition, in the default view mode the color of the edges reflects the tension, indicating if an edge is compressed or stretched. as the initially displayed length of an edge may be different from the calculated value for this connection, the user can estimate how accurate the lengths of the edges are is by looking at their color. treebuilder3d shows stretched edges in blue and compressed edges in red. as an alternative way to filter out insignificant connections, our viewer can use a simple aggregation algorithm, analogous to neighbor-joining method using arithmetic averages, described in. after the'distance matrix' is loaded into the viewer, nodes are placed randomly and the application starts to move nodes in order to keep the length of connecting edges proportional to their input values. the application's algorithm attempts to achieve the most relaxed state of the graph, which should give the most informative display of relationships between datasets, as at that point the displayed length of the edges should become proportional to the input distances. the relaxation algorithm checks one node at a time, making the adjustments for the distances between the current node and all the others. eventually, after several cycles, diagram becomes stabilized. however, the absolute energetic minimum is rarely achieved – especially, with large number of data points. we tested the treebuilder3d, loading different number of sage libraries, and do not recommend opening more than libraries, as it both degrades the performance of the application and makes it harder to achieve minimum tension between the nodes. switching to nj mode does not affect the placement of the nodes, but determines the branching order of the network. it is possible to remove expression libraries or to add them to the analyzed set interactively, while the viewer automatically adjusts the diagram. the underlying java3d api allows manipulating the graph in 3d coordinates, so the user has the ability to pan, rotate or zoom in/out. the viewer uses filenames as labels, which are shown on the selection list, as well as on the graph next to the nodes. alternatively, the'description' option allows specification of an alternative description, which may be read from the header of the files with expression data.  treebuilder3d provides a simple, comprehensible view of relationships in a hierarchy when applied to analysis of large-scale gene expression data generated by methods such as sage. an advantage of representing relationships between gene expression profiles in a three dimensional tree diagram is that it allows the visualization of subtleties in internodal relationships that could be overlooked due to the constraints imposed by a two-dimensional tree diagram. treebuilder3d allows the display of analyzed data in a more natural and intuitive way. availability and requirements the program is written in java and runs on windows or

34," pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, with a range of well-established information including genome annotation. each family in pfam is represented by two multiple sequence alignments and two profile-hidden markov models. pfam has two large series of functionally uncharacterized families, known as domains of unknown function and uncharacterized protein families. dufs are families that have been created by pfam whereas upfs are those created by swiss-prot and added to pfam. the protein structure initiative- has undertaken the task of structurally characterizing all pfam families that have no structural representation. the pfam protein family duf consists of proteins of unknown function, from bacteria and from archaebacteria. herein, we report the first crystal structures of duf family members, including q9rxe from deinococcus radiodurans and q9l0t streptomyces coelicolor and show that they are remarkably similar to pfam family duf  the structure of 10093b was determined to Å resolution using selenium-sad. the final refined model of 10093b contains protomers, sulfate ions, and water molecules. the final refined model of 10093f contains protomers and water molecules. despite low sequence identity, the polypeptide chain structures are very similar. the two structures superimpose well with a rmsd of Å for α-carbon atomic pairs, excluding a loop region between val to ser in 10093b that does not occur in 10093f. this region is absent in all other sequences shown in figure except in thermus thermophilus. values for the highest resolution shell are given within parentheses. 1rmerge = Σ|ii-⟨i⟩|/Σ|ii| where ii is the intensity of the ith measurement, and ⟨i⟩ is the mean intensity for that reflection. 2phasing power and 3fom as defined in sharp. 4rfactor = Σ||fobs|-|fcalc||/Σ|fobs| where |fcalc| and |fobs| are the calculated and observed structure factor amplitudes, respectively. notwithstanding the similarity of the two polypeptide chain folds, mr attempts with various 10093b-derived search models were not successful. molecular replacement may have failed because of low sequence identity and/or due to the presence of multiple protomers within the asymmetric unit. biologically active units 10093b eight monomers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h found in the asymmetric unit form four tightly packed dimers. each dimer pair superimposes very well on the remaining three with rmsds = Å– Å for all α-carbon atomic pairs. a dimer interface analysis performed using pdbsum demonstrated that each pair buries ~ Å of solvent accessible surface area, a value higher than would be found typically in interacting surfaces for a protein of this size. at least residues from each half of the dimer participate in intermolecular interactions. there are direct hydrogen bonded interactions between the protein atoms across the dimer interface. such a tight dimer interface suggests that the 10093b dimer is functional, which is supported by the results of analytical gel filtration. 10093f four monomers a, b, c, and d found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit occur as two dimers, albeit with an intermolecular packing arrangement that differs from that seen for 10093b. each observed 10093f dimer pair buries ~ Å of solvent accessible surface area, which is not thought to be significant for a protein of this size. moreover, the gel-filtration analysis revealed that 10093f is a monomer in solution. in the 10093b dimer, glu from the atypical val166-ser loop makes one of the six hydrogen bonds present in the dimer interface while three other residues in the same loop contribute to van der waals interactions. we suggest that the atypical loop found in 10093b may help support dimerization. the absence of this loop in 10093f may explain the monomeric solution behavior of this family member. structure and sequence relationships and homology modeling in an effort to annotate the function of these two related proteins, bioinformatics analysis with the experimental structures was performed using dali. for 10093b, a dali search revealed only two structural matches with a z-score greater than the closest match, af from archaeoglobus fulgidus, a protein of unknown function belonging to pfam duf gave a z-score of with sequence identity of 15% and rmsd of Å between structurally equivalent α-carbon atomic pairs. thus, structure determination of 10093b not only provided the first structural information for the pfam family duf it also documented unexpected structural similarity to a member of the duf pfam family that could not have been reliably predicted from sequence comparisons alone. a dali search with 10093f revealed significant matches with af z-score, as expected, and with a nitrate transport protein z-score of with sequence identity of 12% and rmsd between structurally equivalent α-carbon atomic pairs of Å. stereoviews of the superimposed polypeptide chains of 10093b over 10093f-monomers, -dimers and 10093b over 1zbm are presented in figure 3a, 3b and 3c respectively. a blast search of uniprot protein sequence database using the sequences of both 10093b and 10093f yielded matches. virtually all of the matches are identified as bacterial or archaeal hypothetical proteins. the three exceptions are as follows: a sam-dependent methyltransferase from lactococcus lactis, leucyl-trna synthetase from xanthomonas campestris, d-alanine-d-alanine ligase from nitrosomonas europaea. at the time of publication, the experimental structures of 10093b and 10093f were used as a template to compute homology models of proteins with related sequences with the modweb server. the models out of had sequence identity of great than 30%. active site/ligand binding site prediction active site/ligand binding site prediction performed using castp revealed two major clefts on the surfaces of the 10093b and 10093f. further analysis of these surface features together with a multiple sequence alignment performed in clustalw and edited in bioedit performed for 10093b reveals the presence of most of the conserved residues, including asn pro ser ser ser ile gly and asp. we suggest that this larger cleft represents the active site and/or ligand binding site for this functionally uncharacterized pfam family. prediction of putative function 10093b and 10093f belonging to duf family have remarkable similarity to duf protein family and a nitrate-binding protein. this similarity was not evident from sequence comparison alone. moreover, the uncharacterized duf family of proteins is annotated to be putative solute-binding protein. our analysis of the surface clefts shows that the major cleft identified in 10093b is common to all of them, the size being nearly the same. the binding pocket of 10093b superposes well with that of nitrate-binding protein. further analysis of the active site shows that the entry of this cavity is occupied by hydrophobic residues as in 2g. in 10093b, the residual density in the difference fourier showed a dumb bell shaped density and was modeled as water. this could very well be an unidentified ion. based on the comparison of structures and binding sites, we predict that this protein could be a solute binding protein, though we cannot at this stage identify the nature of the ion. the weak homology implies that it may be a different kind of solute.  the structure determination of 10093b and 10093f has revealed the unexpected similarity between duf and duf family of proteins suggesting that the information from three-dimensional structures along with the sequence information will predict the family of proteins of similar functions more reliably. we have predicted the protein to be a solute-binding protein based on structure and binding cavity. fold and structural similarity among proteins with low sequence identity is not uncommon. one prominent example would be proteins classified into different pfams but with the same tim barrel fold. amidohydrolases with low sequence homology have various substrate specificities and different enzymatic functions but all of them have similar fold. these belong to different pfam families but are grouped together as a super family. this also suggests that duf and duf though belonging to different pfams of unknown functions, may be members of the same superfamily. "," pfam is a comprehensive collection of protein domains and families, with a range of well-established information including genome annotation. pfam has two large series of functionally uncharacterized families, known as domains of unknown function and uncharacterized protein families.  crystal structures of two proteins from deinococcus radiodurans and streptomyces coelicolor belonging to pfam protein family duf have been determined using selenium-single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. based on the structure, we have identified the putative function for this family of protein.  unexpectedly, we found that duf pfam is remarkably similar to pfam family duf suggesting that the sequence-based classification alone may not be sufficient to classify proteins into pfam families.

35," phage display libraries consist of small antibody fragments cloned into a display phage vector, allowing efficient antibody screening and production in a bacterial system. traditional antibodies are composed of a heavy- and a light-chain that need to recombine in a tetramer for the formation of a functional antibody. because most of these random recombinations will yield non-functional antibodies, when produced as recombinant fragments in e. coli, isolation of effective antibodies demands extremely large phage libraries. camelidae have, next to conventional antibodies, dimeric heavy chain antibodies that lack light chains. the variable domain of the hcab has a single binding domain with a specificity and affinity similar to conventional antibodies. in a phage display library, each phage displays a different antigen-binding domain on its surface. to isolate specific antibodies, phage particles from a library are bound to an antigen, recovered and used to infect fresh bacteria. subsequently, phages go through several rounds of epitope binding and re-infection resulting in an enrichment of binding phages. a perfect experiment will ultimately yield groups of phages, each encoding a different antibody directed against the starting antigen. the set of phages can be used together as'polyclonal phages', individual phages as'monoclonal phages'. after selection, individual vhh clones are characterized to determine their specificity by elisa and their diversity by fingerprinting/sequencing. although ultimate identification is done using clone-insert nucleotide sequencing, pre-sequence fingerprinting is performed to reduce cost. phage display clones are usually analysed using restriction digestion of pcr amplified vhh insert, followed by agarose gel-electrophoresis. however, this methodology is time consuming, labour intensive, has limited resolution and is not effective for the analysis of a large number of clones. in the current study, we developed a protocol using high resolution melt curve analysis to visualise clonal diversity and study enrichment of clones after vhh-selection from a llama non-immune phage display library. unlike the traditional application for melt curve analysis, where base pair differences are detected through a change in melt temperature of a fully base-paired hybrid and mismatched hybrids, the current study uses differences in melt curve shape and the tm of each melt curve to identify template nucleotide sequence similarities within a large group of unlike pcr fragments. similar melt curve shapes represent similar dna sequences and melt curves can be automatically and efficiently grouped using the available hrma software.  after two rounds of selection against an epitope spanning the first amino acids of the huntingtin protein, phages were picked and elisa showed positive and negative wells. an optical density of or higher was considered a positive result while the negative control was less than. clone diversity was investigated using both hrma and hinfi restriction digestion of pcr-amplified clone inserts. as expected, since the pcr fragments had an average size of bp, hrma showed a wide range of melt profiles often containing multiple melting domains per fragment representing differences in nucleotide sequence. representative results from independent hrma analyses are shown in figure a comparison of the elisa and hrma results are shown in figure only the elisa-positive clones are represented in this figure. there was a complete agreement of elisa-positive and elisa-negative clones with hrma analysis. the elisa-positive clones belonged to different groups, the largest group contained clones, one group clones, one group clones, and groups contained a unique clone. of the remaining clones that showed a negative elisa, clones could not be analysed by hrma because of a low pcr yield and/or low quality melting. the remaining clones could be grouped into different groups, consisting of one large group of clones and three groups of and clones, respectively. the remaining groups all contained clones or less. all groups identified by restriction digestion fingerprinting were also identified by hrma. groups could overall be confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis and pcr fragments were approximately bp in length ranging from to bp with a tm of either or 86°c and a g/c content of or 54%. the most common fragment length was bp with a tm of 86°c and a g/c content of 54%. fragments with these characteristics were present in the majority of groups assigned by the software. as can be seen in figure hrma even identified one additional group that was not seen with fingerprinting. however, as can be seen in the red hrma group in figure occasionally, elisa results and hrma results did not agree with restriction digestion results. sequencing showed that the red clone with the different digestion pattern was bp different from the other clones in this hrma group. these changes were outside the vhh encoding region and thus did not affect vhh binding characteristics. however, this bp difference did change a hinfi restriction site resulting in a different restriction pattern. discussion hrma has been used routinely for mutation scanning on patient samples with small fragments of equal size that differ only or a few nucleotides in sequence. the temperature at which the probe-template hybrid melts, distinguishes between fully base-paired hybrids from mismatched hybrids. in the current study, we developed a protocol using hrma to identify clonal origin of vhh fragments selected from a phage display library as an alternative for dna fingerprinting. the protocol uses the differences in melt curve shape and tm of each melt curve to identify template nucleotide sequence similarities within a large group of samples. although the software used for hrma was originally designed to detect bp differences between two small fragments, our results demonstrate that it is also capable of accurately analysing melt curves from longer unlike pcr fragments. hrma is a very efficient technique to obtain a quick overview and determine if clone selection was successful. from a successful selection experiment one expects several recurring clones. when all clones are different, no enrichment has taken place and clone selection has probably failed, when all clones are identical, the success is probably also doubtful. when the elisa negative clones contain a large recurrent set, these clones might either be well-growing but have low-affinity/are non-specific or high affinity clones that somehow fail to produce enough vhh in order to obtain a positive elisa signal. hrma is also suitable to follow clone selection; initially one expects all clones to be different, with larger clone sets emerging in later rounds of selection. when comparing hrma to digestion analysis of the vhh fragments, hrma analysis is a more sensitive and efficient method to determine clonal similarity. all groups identified with restriction digestion fingerprinting could also be identified by hrma and were overall confirmed by sequence analysis. it is a simple and rapid method taking only two and a half hours to complete after pcr amplification. furthermore, it is inexpensive, requiring only pcr, a dna dye, and melting instrumentation. in the current study we have used the lightcycler for the final pcr amplification and melt curve analysis, however, any block cycler can be used for amplification and the subsequent melt analysis could then be performed with other high-resolution melting devices such as the lightscanner. multiple samples can be analysed simultaneously and groups can be assigned in an automated manner.  hrma is very efficient to obtain a quick overview and determine if clone selection was successful. similar groups of clones identified by restriction digestion fingerprinting were also identified by hrma and were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. hrma is suitable for a wide variety of applications where verification and/or analysis of clonal diversity is essential, including determining clone diversity in a single-chain fv phage library, analysis of clones obtained after in vitro mutagenesis, cdna clones to determine allelic expression and clones to determine methylation status of genomic regions. "," methodologies like phage display selection, in vitro mutagenesis and the determination of allelic expression differences include steps where large numbers of clones need to be compared and characterised. in the current study we show that high-resolution melt curve analysis is a simple, cost-saving tool to quickly study clonal variation without prior nucleotide sequence knowledge.  hrma results nicely matched those obtained with elisa and compared favourably to dna fingerprinting of restriction digested clone insert-pcr. dna sequence analysis confirmed that hrma-clustered clones contained identical inserts.  using hrma, analysis of up to samples can be done simultaneously and will take approximately minutes. clustering of clones can be largely automated using the system's software within hours. applied to the analysis of clones obtained after phage display antibody selection, hrma facilitated a quick overview of the overall success as well as the identification of identical clones. our approach can be used to characterize any clone set prior to sequencing, thereby reducing sequencing costs significantly.

36," pax is expressed in the developing eye and brain, where it affects both progenitor cell production and neuronal differentiation. the pax protein contains two dna binding domains, a paired domain and a paired-type homeodomain. the pd consists of two separate helix-turn-helix motifs, termed pai and red, which act on different target sequences. the best characterised pax alternative splicing event, involving the insertion of a bp exon into the pai subdomain of the pd, results in two major pax isoforms with different dna-binding properties. in vitro studies have shown that the pai subdomain of pax binds preferentially to a consensus sequence but that pai subdomain disruption in pax allows the red subdomain to bind an alternative sequence. pax affects early progenitor cell proliferation and later neuronal differentiation in the developing brain. this changing role might be due at least in part to a shift in the relative concentrations of pax and pax during development but there has been no previous report of such alterations during neurogenesis in the brain in vivo. we anticipated that even relatively small changes in the pax: pax ratio might be important since stronger effects on gene activity via p6con and 5acon are observed if pax and pax are introduced into cultured cell lines at ratios of 1: or 8: than at ratios of 2: 4: or 16:. we selected a direct method for quantification of the ratio and carried out multiple assays so as to obtain statistically analysable data on key pax6-expressing brain tissues at a range of ages throughout neurogenesis. we found changes in the ratio similar in magnitude to those shown previously to alter target gene activity in vitro.  rnase protection assays were carried out on tissues dissected from wild type mouse embryos aged e -e and quantified by densitometry. the pax: pax ratio varied throughout neurogenesis in the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain, following a similar pattern in each. in the telencephalon, the ratio was about 6: early in neurogenesis, at e, but was significantly lower at each subsequent age. in the diencephalon and hindbrain, ratios were about 8: and 10: at e but were lower from e -e; these decreases were statistically significant when data from all three age groups were combined. combining results from the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain showed a significant fall in the pax: pax ratio between e and e, from approximately 8: to 3:, with a further slight decrease at e and e. data on the pax: pax ratio in the eye at e -e did not show the same trend. ratios varied from about 10: at e to about 4: at e but none of the differences were statistically significant. although we did not detect significant changes in the eye, it is possible that non-synchronised changes in the ratio do occur within its component pax6-expressing neural and non-neural tissues. neither pax nor pax was detected in samples from the feet. there is evidence that pax and pax have different functions in vivo in both vertebrates and invertebrates. studies of pax6- and pax6-related genes in drosophila melanogaster, ey/ toy and eyg/ toe, have shown that they promote, respectively, differentiation and proliferation of eye precursor cells. overexpression of pax and pax can alter the expression of different sets of genes in mammals. mammalian brain cells reduce their proliferation in response to overexpression of pax or pax and increase their neurogenesis in response to overexpression of pax. it is possible that a reduction in the pax: pax mrna ratio from e is involved in programming progenitor cells to initiate processes that occur later in embryogenesis. such processes are potentially numerous; they might, for example, include the transition from predominantly neurogenesis to the major phase of gliogenesis or the development of specific sets of later-generated neurones such as the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex.  we conclude that the pax: pax ratio falls in the telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain during neurogenesis and, moreover, the magnitude of the change is in the range that alters target gene expression in vitro. this finding allows the possibility that changes in the relative expression levels of isoforms of a single pax gene might result in changes in the functions of this gene in mammalian brain development. "," early in mammalian brain development cell proliferation generates a population of progenitor cells whose subsequent divisions produce increasing numbers of postmitotic neurons. pax affects both processes and it has been suggested that this changing role is due at least in part to changes in the relative concentrations of its two main isoforms, pax and pax created by insertion of a bp exon into one of the two dna-binding domains. crucially, however, no previous study has determined whether the ratio between pax and pax transcripts alters during mammalian neurogenesis in vivo.  using rnase protection assays, we show that pax transcripts are 6– times more prevalent than pax transcripts early in neurogenesis in the murine telencephalon, diencephalon and hindbrain and that the ratio later falls significantly to about 3: in these regions.  these changes in vivo are similar in magnitude to those shown previously to alter target gene activity in vitro and might, therefore, allow the single mammalian pax gene to carry out different functions at different times in mammalian brain development.

37," epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, affecting approximately to 2% of the population. the majority of epileptic patients are successfully treated with anti-epileptic drugs. nevertheless, about 20–25% of epileptic patients, as defined as medically intractable epilepsy, fail to respond to aeds. aeds can prevent abnormal neuronal firing and seizure spread at seizure focus. the enzymatic activity of glutathione s-transferases in liver plays an essential role in metabolizing and clearing aeds. gsts are a group of phase ii enzymes of defense that catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide range of electrophiles. there are eight isoforms of soluble gst and at least three membrane bound gst isoforms. gsts are widely expressed in almost every tissue, while some isoforms show tissue-specific distribution. in mammals, expression of gst-α, μ, and π in cns was reported. in the present study, it is hypothesized that higher levels of gsts in brain, especially in brain-blood barrier may result in poor intraparenchymal accumulation of aeds, and lead to medical intractability. therefore, expression levels of gst-α, μ, and π at cortex from intractable epileptic patients were examined.  epileptic patients and their brain lesions thirty two epileptic patients had been treated for over years with aeds, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, valproate and topiramate. twenty-seven of them received three drug trials, and the other five patients received four drugs trials. the seizures attacked at least times per month during the last six months. medical imaging and h&e staining identified structural abnormities in brains of all cases. these structural brain abnormities included cases of hippocampal sclerosis, cases of arteriovenous malformations, cases of old infarct, and case of virus encephalitis. seizure focuses in cortex were found in cases out of patients. surgical management successfully removed epileptic associated brain lesions and seizure focuses. gst expression in epileptic cortex expression of gsts in cortical tissues from epilepsy patients were compared with the controls from patients with arteriovenous malformations using immunohistochemistry. gst-α was not detectible in either control specimens or epileptic brain specimens. however, it was detected in positive control specimens. gst-μ immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells and glial cells in 63% of control patients. the gst-μ staining localized in cytoplasm. fifty three percent of epileptic patients showed gst-μ immunoreactivity in endothelial cells and glial cells. no significant difference in intensity of gst-μ staining was observed between epileptic patients and controls. gst-π immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells and glial cells with a clear cytoplasmic staining. fifty percent of control patients were gst-π positive, while 66% of epileptic patients were gst-π positive. the grading of epileptic patients was significantly higher than that of control patients. because all the controls were patients with arteriovenous malformations, comparison was further made between the subgroup of epileptic patients with arteriovenous malformations and controls. four epileptic patients showed gst-π immunoreactivity. the intensity of gst-π staining in glial cells was higher in epileptic patients than that in controls, but the grading of epileptic patients was not significantly increased compared to that of control patients. in controls, gst-π positive glial cells showed less intensity of gst-π staining than endothelial cells. in epileptic group, gst-π positive cells widely distributed in cortex and subcortex white matter. no gst-π-positive neuron or glial cells were found in the hippocampus. gst-π positive cells in epileptic patients showed significant increase in immunoreactivity. the highly gst-π stained glial cells frequently showed morphology of astrocytes. # p >, epilepsy vs. control * p <, epilepsy vs. control discussion because of the lack of response to antiepileptic drugs, medical intractability is a crucial clinical problem in human epilepsy therapy. one of the most important mechanisms of intractability is the poor penetration of aeds into brain. it has been shown that gst enzymatic activity in liver plays an essential role in clearing aeds from blood. expression of gsts in brain tissue, especially at the brain-blood barrier may provide critical role in preventing aeds from reaching seizure focus. therefore, the present study investigated expression patterns of gsts in brains of intractable epileptic patients. epilepsy is characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. it starts from seizure focus, where a sudden, excessive discharge of cortical neurons appear. the majority of seizure focuses are found at cortex. in the present study, out of intractable epileptic patients have cortical seizure focuses. to examine the role of gsts in development of intractability, expression of gst-α, μ, and π at seizure focuses were investigated with immunohistochemistry, and were compared with control normal cortex. gst-α mainly exists in the liver, and is responsible for detoxication. in the present study, we found gst-α is not present in brain. though cortex expresses gst-μ, it does not correlate with intractability. gst-π is expressed by cerebral endothelial cells and glial cells. expression of gst-π was significantly higher in epileptic brain specimens than in controls. elevated gst-π in glial cells in seizure focus was more evident. those gst-π positive glial cells showed a typical morphology of astrocytes. noticeably, gst-π positive astrocytes widely spread at seizure focuses. as they are the major components of the brain-blood barrier, endothelial cells and astrocytes directly affect the intraparenchymal accumulation of aeds. therefore, elevated gst-π in those cells may greatly reduce the efficacy of aeds. upregulation of gst-π may be one of the key components that contribute to intractability. epilepsy develops intractability with the aed treatment. it takes various amount of time for epilepsy to become intractable. it is still unknown how epilepsy acquires intractability. the correlation between gst-π and intractability may suggest that epilepsy acquires the intractability by expressing high level of gst-π in the brain. thus, gst-π-inducing ability could be associated with the efficacy of aeds. the better aeds could be that have low gst-π-inducing ability. moreover, targeting gst-π may also improve treatment outcomes in individuals with intractable epilepsy. although some gst isoforms at liver, testis, and brain tissues were reported to be induced by aeds in animal studies, the induction of gst-π by aeds remains to be studied.  high levels of gst-π in endothelial cells and glial cells/astrocyte correlate to medical intractable epilepsy, suggesting that gst-π contributes to resistance to aed treatment. "," glutathione s-transferases play an important role in metabolizing anti-epileptic drugs in liver. expressions of gsts in brain, which may result in poor efficacy of aeds, have not been well studied. using clinical cortex specimen from intractable epileptic subjects and non-epileptic controls, the present study investigated the correlation between gsts and intractable epilepsy.  three different gst isoforms were detected with immunohistochemistry. gst-α expression was not seen in any cortex specimens. sixty three percent of control and 53% of intractible epileptic specimens showed gst-μ immunoreactivity. no significant difference in intensity of gst-μ staining was observed between these two groups. gst-π expression was found in endothelial cells and glial cells/astrocytes. fifty percent of the control patients and 66% of the epileptic patients were gst-π positive. the grading of epileptic patients was significantly higher than that of control patients.  high levels of gst-π in endothelial cells and glial cells/astrocyte correlate to medical intractable epilepsy, suggesting that gst-π contributes to resistance to aed treatment.

38," our understanding of the molecular, genetic basis of adaptations and phenotypic differentiation among individuals will advance quickly thanks to new molecular techniques. this understanding is crucial given that accelerating environmental change and human population growth are increasingly threatening natural populations of fish and wildlife as well as increasing demands for agricultural production in domesticated species. this makes it urgent in many wild and domestic species to investigate the genetic basis of fitness, adaptation, and disease resistance, and to discover adaptive genes and speciation genes, i.e., the ""loci of evolution"". understanding the genetic basis of phenotypes generally requires genotyping thousands of gene-targeted loci, genome-wide. despite the declining costs of next generation dna sequencing, it remains costly enough to prohibit analyzing large portions of genomes in numerous individuals as is required for population studies. fortunately, with coding gene sequences comprising a mere 2% of the typical eukaryotic genome, and the development of techniques for isolating exome dna, re-sequencing coding portions genome-wide can be done at a reasonable per-sample cost, locating thousands of informative gene markers. because exon sequences are relatively conserved we hypothesized that most exons from one species could be used to capture exons from another species for use in next generation sequencing for snp discovery. exon capture enriches for exon dna by simultaneous hybridization of fragmented genomic dna from the study individual to many thousands of oligonucleotide probes that are complementary to gene-coding sequences. the captured fragments are then sequenced in parallel on next-generation sequencing platforms. exon capture has been tested almost exclusively in model species, typically baiting either the whole exome or a single chromosomal region. facilitated by availability of genome sequences for the target organism, such studies leave untested the potential application of exon capture to a wider variety of organisms. probe design for exome-wide capture requires knowledge of thousands of exon sequences. with few fully sequenced eukaryotic genome sequences available, it would appear to be useful for only a small proportion of eukaryotic species. even if vertebrate genomes are eventually sequenced, there would still remain tens of thousands of vertebrate species without genome sequences or any genome resources. here we show that the exon capture method has a more general application, reporting exon capture in two livestock species, bos taurus and bos indicus, and one wildlife species, bison bison. we conducted all three captures through hybridization to sequences from the published bos taurus genome. we baited a small genome-wide fraction of the exome, sampling exons in about 10% of the taurine genome's estimated minimum total of genes. our results demonstrate that genetic divergence between a reference genome and individuals queried does not prohibit exome-wide identification of candidate snps and differences in non-model species. this suggests the method can be applied to many domestic and wildlife species lacking sequenced genomes. further, we found that baiting a small fraction of the exome yielded thousands of candidate heterozygous snps.  we sequenced genomic dna from our three individuals, enriched for exons by hybridization to probes on a microarray. reference exon sequences came from sampling an average of exons from each of genes spread evenly across the autosomes and the x chromosome. we also chose candidate genes with known associations with disease susceptibility and other important traits. for all candidate genes, the entire exon sets were targeted for capture. illumina genome analyzer sequencing of the enriched dna, followed by mapping of the base-pair, single end sequence reads and consensus genotyping with maq software, yielded high-confidence nucleotide base calls comprising 77% of our targeted exonic positions in the taurine, 80% in the zebu and 82% in the bison. the called single-nucleotide genotypes differed from the reference across the genome at positions totalling in the bison, in the zebu, and in the taurine. as a percentage of total targeted nucleotides with high confidence base calls, % of the bison calls differed from the reference taurine, compared to % for each of the two bos species. the higher percentage of differences in the bison is expected in light of its one to two million years of genetic separation from the taurine cattle. the divergence between the two species in the target region of the exome estimated by our results, about differences in every thousand bases, is likely conservative, given the limitations of mapping software in accounting for real base differences versus incorrect sequencer base calls. in our candidate genes, we identified putative heterozygous snps among genes in the bison, heterozygous snps in genes in the zebu, and in genes in the taurine. it is encouraging that from only one individual zebu, for example, we find high-confidence snp calls in 60% of our candidate genes of interest for future research. for all targeted base pairs, heterozygous positions were called in our taurine, in the zebu, and in the bison. concordance of some of our called single-base differences with published snps is indicated by the of our taurine variant calls matching in position and all but one allele among million ncbi dbsnp records positioned on the same reference genome used in our study. as expected we found lower dbsnp concordance in our non-taurus individuals; about 11% among our zebu's called differences were matched in dbsnp and 4% of our bison's snp calls had matches. for each individual, total consensus bases different from the reference, for heterozygous snps, fixed differences, and concordance with million entries in ncbi's dbsnp database. total differences from the reference are also given as a percentage of total genotyped bases. dbsnp position matches are also given as a percentage of total differences. dbsnp allele mismatches give the number of alleles that differed from a dbsnp allele while matching its position; for example, in the bison, of the positions matching snps in dbsnp, showed alleles different than those listed at dbsnp.  our results demonstrate two novel strategies for exon capture: sampling a small but genome-wide subset of the exome for discovery of thousands of putative snps, and successful bait and capture across relatively divergent genomes. result reduces the cost of sequencing the capture products, making genome-wide snp discovery more affordable. exon capture with a subset of exons can complement large genotyping projects by facilitating discovery of thousands of snps based on assaying many individuals to avoid ascertainment bias in population genetic inferences. further, it allows genotyping of both candidate genes and genome-wide loci, combining the strengths of the candidate gene and genome scan approaches commonly used to identify adaptive and economically important loci. result makes feasible these analyses in natural populations of divergent species with lesser-known genomes and from diverse environments worldwide, e.g. domestic and wild bovids from siberia to the tropics. the conservation of exon sequences appears sufficient for the method to enable genome-wide studies based on probing across taxa as phylogenetically divergent as american bison and taurine cattle. future research should test increased divergence between organisms referenced and baited to see how wide a taxonomic distance the method can bridge. with success across many taxa while targeting a high value part of the exome small enough for affordable next-generation sequencing of many individuals, exon capture can be a powerful application of high-throughput genomics to the genetic analysis of populations, even in species with enormous genomes but no whole-genome reference. it has exciting potential to reveal in unprecedented detail the genetic basis of evolution, including adaptive differentiation and speciation. "," gene-targeted and genome-wide markers are crucial to advance evolutionary biology, agriculture, and biodiversity conservation by improving our understanding of genetic processes underlying adaptation and speciation. unfortunately, for eukaryotic species with large genomes it remains costly to obtain genome sequences and to develop genome resources such as genome-wide snps. a method is needed to allow gene-targeted, next-generation sequencing that is flexible enough to include any gene or number of genes, unlike transcriptome sequencing. such a method would allow sequencing of many individuals, avoiding ascertainment bias in subsequent population genetic analyses. we demonstrate the usefulness of a recent technology, exon capture, for genome-wide, gene-targeted marker discovery in species with no genome resources. we use coding gene sequences from the domestic cow genome sequence to capture, and subsequently sequence, thousands of exons of b. taurus, b. indicus, and bison bison. our capture array has probes for exons in genes, including candidate genes with known function and of interest for their association with disease and other fitness traits.  we successfully sequenced and mapped exon sequences from across the autosomes and x chromosome in the b. taurus genome sequence. exon capture and high-throughput sequencing identified thousands of putative snps spread evenly across all reference chromosomes, in all three individuals, including hundreds of snps in our targeted candidate genes.  this study shows exon capture can be customized for snp discovery in many individuals and for non-model species without genomic resources. our captured exome subset was small enough for affordable next-generation sequencing, and successfully captured exons from a divergent wild species using the domestic cow genome as reference.

39," prediction of protein three-dimensional structures from their amino acid sequences is one of the important goals of computational biology. the rate of determination of protein structures by experimental methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography cannot, unfortunately, catch up with the extremely rapid growth of protein sequences from the mass-scale genome sequencing studies. additionally experimental structure determination methods are quite expensive both in terms of equipment and human effort, mostly because of difficulties in obtaining high quality protein crystals. because of this, the computational prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence becomes increasingly important. there are two types of computational strategies for predicting protein structure: template-based protein structure modeling and ab initio structure prediction. ab initio methods try to build three-dimensional protein models ""from scratch"", and are based on physical considerations rather than on the use of a previously solved individual structure. ab initio procedures require significant computational resources to perform searches throughout the whole conformational space to seek the lowest energy conformers, and therefore are applicable only for relatively small proteins. template-based protein modeling utilizes known protein structures as the starting points for structure prediction. these methods may also be divided into two categories: comparative modeling and protein threading. homology modeling is based on the assumption that two homologous proteins have similar structures. when the query sequence has sequence identity of approximately 30% or higher in comparison with a sequence having a known structure available from the protein data bank, we use homology modeling to predict protein structure. when only distant homologs with low sequence identity to the query sequence can be found in pdb, we use protein threading algorithm to select a protein fold. the basic idea of protein threading is that the target sequence for which the structure is being predicted is threaded through the backbones of a collection of template protein structures and energy scores are calculated for each sequence-structure alignment using knowledge-based coarse-grained potentials such as four-body potentials, two-body potentials and short-range potentials employed in this server. all two-body potentials available on our server were previously analyzed in by pokarowski et al., who compared different two-body potentials currently used in computational biology, and approximated them with simple functions of the physical properties of amino acids. all these pair-contact potentials can be expressed as symmetric matrices. the best known representatives of the two-body potentials, are the mj potentials, which were first introduced by miyazawa and jernigan in, and then rederived using an updated, larger protein dataset in. both papers are highly cited, according to the isi web of science. mj potentials were derived from the statistics of inter-residue contacts occurring in a set of proteins using the quasi-chemical approximation with an approximate estimation of the chain connectivity effects. there are two kinds of mj two-body contact potentials, eij and eij', denoted as mj1- and mj1h-3h in our web server. the later one includes the energy of transfer of amino acids from water to the protein environment. the pair-contact energies eij and eij' were derived based on the assumptions that and. here indices i, j, and represent residue i, residue j and solvent respectively, and is the statistical average of the number of contacts nij between residues of types i and j. more details of the derivation of mj two-body contact potentials are given in reference. since the correlation coefficients between mj2h and mj1h and between mj and mj as shown in reference are quite high, we only use mj2h and mj for threading purposes in our potential server. more details about all of the two-body potentials and their abbreviations used in our server can be found in pokarowski's paper. the four-body contact potentials and short-range interaction potentials have been derived by considering different aspects of protein structures than those used to derive pair-contact potentials. the four-body contact potentials are appropriate for representing the cooperative parts of the protein folding process, and we have shown that they are quite successful for recognizing the native structures among hundreds or even thousands of decoys from the decoys'r'us database. short-range interaction energies allow us to estimate free energies from the statistical distribution of local conformational descriptors. we usually assume that the lower the computed energy score; the better is the predicted structure in accordance with the thermodynamic hypothesis that the native state of a protein has the lowest free energy. potential energies are essential for all protein structure prediction methods, and can be used either to guide the conformational search process, or to select a native structure from a preselected set of possible models of the structure. protein contact potentials are also used in protein design, protein docking, simulations of folding, and in many other applications. knowledge-based optimization potentials are usually derived from the known protein structures solved by x-ray crystallography or nmr, by fitting their values to optimize the recognition of the native structures from sets of computer generated structures. in contrast to atomic potentials based on real physical interactions, knowledge-based potentials incorporate and average over many different physical interactions, such as hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen-bond and cation-π interactions, and so these statistically derived potentials do not necessarily reflect true energies but rather are effective ones averaged over many of the atomic details. results of the critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction show that the groups using knowledge-based statistical potentials have been more successful for both ab initio structure prediction and template based modeling. although most of the potentials available on our server were derived a number of years ago, these potentials have never been collected nor made accessible to the public through a web server. our knowledge-based potential server will overcome this deficiency and should be an extremely convenient location for any researcher to compute and compare energies of different protein conformations of the same protein. implementation all different knowledge-based potentials included in our server are listed on the top of the web page at http://gor.bb.iastate.edu/potential. the abbreviations of the potentials employed in our server are the same as in reference. details of each of the knowledge-based potentials and the related literature references can be accessed by clicking the corresponding name on the list of potentials. all of these different potentials except the general four-body potentials have been published in the literature over the last years. the general four-body potentials are the newest modifications of our recently published four-body contact potentials that are also included in the server. we will update the literature referring to the general four-body potentials after the publication of the relevant paper. we should also note that our potential server is an ongoing project; the list of potentials included is neither final nor complete, and we will add more knowledge-based potentials that have either been omitted now or that will be published in the future. we are open to comments and suggestions for including new knowledge-based potentials and for improvement of our web server.  the pearson correlation between four-body potentials and general four-body potentials is. since the short-range potentials and four-body potentials were derived in a completely different way compared from pairwise potentials, we can not calculate the pearson correlation for them. because the highly correlated pairwise potentials may lead to redundant threading results, we show that there are pairwise potentials with low correlations below. the correlation between vd and msbm is -, the lowest correlation. the users may choose the most different potentials according to figure the potential server currently accepts only one file or a set of files corresponding to different conformations of the same protein in the pdb format. the users should compress multiple pdb files into a single zip archive before submitting them to the server. each pdb file should contain only a single conformation. the server will check whether the uploaded pdb files correspond to nmr or x-ray structures and will check the total number of atoms in a single pdb file. the server will not compute energies either for nmr structures or for pdb files having more than atoms, and will only send warning messages via email. if the uploaded zip file contains both nmr and x-ray structures, the server can recognize x-ray structures and will compute only energies for all qualified structures. if users want to estimate the energies of nmr structures, they should split the multiple models into separate pdb files before submitting them to the server. we allow the main program to run in the background, so users can close their web browsers once they finish uploading the files. the server first calculates the residue accessible surface area using naccess that is used for energy calculations with four-body contact potentials, and then it computes and outputs the energies for the four-body potentials, the two-body potentials and the short-range conformational potentials. finally the server integrates all of these results into one text output file and sends this file to the email address supplied by the user. all the structural data files in the pdb format are analyzed on a coarse grained level as follows: the geometric center of all side-chain heavy atoms from one residue is calculated to represent this residue, or if the pdb file has only backbone atoms, then the cα atom is used to represent the residue. we have provided one example for users on the website to help them learn how to use the server. this example shows the practical application of our potential server for fold recognition. the supplied zip archive contains pdb files including 1ctf.pdb - the native crystal structure of the c-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l7/l from escherichia coli at a resolution of Å and other pdb files that are computer generated conformations, or so called decoys, of 1ctf. the results returned by the server via e-mail show that the native structure has the energy lower than any other decoy when threaded for all potentials except ts, mj and msbm. the possibility to compute the energies of threadings by using a variety of knowledge-based potentials increases the reliability of fold recognition and may be used in the future to develop improved consensus predictions. for the above example containing pdb files, it takes the sever about seconds to complete the calculations. we have also tested the potential server on a much larger set of pdb files for a protein composed of amino acids; in this case it took the server around minutes to compute the results and return them by e-mail. recently, we have tested the server using pdb files submitted simultaneously; and it took the server around minutes to return the results by email. the size of the zip file for those files was mb. this shows that the server has the ability to compute a large number of pdb files at one time. it should be convenient for users requiring energies to be calculated for large numbers of computer generated conformations. the server consists of a linux box with redhat enterprise operating system with gb ram and gb hard disk storage. the program code was written in c++ and the web interface has been developed using a cgi script written in html and perl. we may make further improvements in the future to our server by upgrading its hardware and software for enhanced performance depending on the extent of users' demands. users are encouraged to contact the system administrator via the e-mail provided on the web page to solve any possible problems or to suggest improvements to the functionality and performance of the server.  the knowledge-based potential server is an easily accessible, freely available tool with a web interface that collects all existing and future protein coarse-grained potentials and computes energies of multiple structural models. it allows evaluation of energies of different protein folds for non-computational biology specialists, and significantly improves the access to a wide variety of knowledge-based potentials. the server accepts multiple structural files in the pdb format and the results are sent back to users promptly at the supplied e-mail address. availability and requirements project home page: http://gor.bb.iastate.edu/potential operating system: redhat enterprise operating system with gb ram and gb hard disk storage programming language: c++, perl, cgi script license: gnu gpl the potential server is freely accessible to all users. abbreviations pdb: protein data bank;

40," microarray technology provides simultaneous measurements of expression levels for thousands of genes. each step from sample preparation to data analysis, however, contains potential sources of bias and variability. proper normalization adjusts for differences which interfere with the comparison of intensities of different labels at a given probe and with the comparison of intensities of corresponding probes on different arrays. proper data normalization should allow for the comparison of expression levels across different arrays. subsequent data analysis results are heavily dependent on effective normalization. normalization issues differ for dual-labeled platforms compared to single labeled platforms such as the affymetrix genechip arrays. in this paper we address normalization for dual-labeled arrays with either cdna or oligonucleotide probes. the objective of normalization for dual-labeled arrays is to correct for differences in intensities for the two labels on the same array. these differences arise from factors such as differences in sample concentrations, differences in photomultiplier tube setting, and differences in the affinity of the two labels for dna. median or mean based global normalization methods use a single normalization factor applied to all genes on the array to adjust for labeling bias. such methods are widely used because of their simplicity. intensity-based and location-based methods take into account intensity and spatial dependence on dye bias normalization factors. both global and intensity/location based normalization methods assume that most of the genes are not differentially expressed between the two samples hybridized on the array, and that for the differentially expressed genes, the direction of the difference is symmetric between the two samples. in many important cases, however, these assumptions are not appropriate because: 1) more than half of the genes are differentially expressed on the array; 2) the numbers of over- and under-expressed genes on the array are unequal; 3) only genes of specific biological interest are selected to make a customized array, which are highly variable across the samples. in the above cases, the global normalization methods and intensity/location based normalization methods become less accurate and a more sophisticated method is needed. there are some methods which attempt to adaptively identify the subset of'housekeeping' genes. these methods require multiple arrays in order to identify the'housekeeping' gene set, which does not always exist. newton et al. proposed a gamma-gamma-bernoulli model for identifying differentially expressed genes in dual labeled arrays. we have generalized newton's model and here propose an adaptive method based on three-component mixture model for normalization of dual labeled microarray data.  as described in the methods section, we have applied our adaptive method to both the simulated data and real data. we have also compared our method with the global method and the intensity-based lowess method. results of the simulation studies are shown as bar plots in figure figure 1a shows the comparison of our adaptive method, the global method and the lowess method when no noise was added. when the majority of genes in the array were non-differentially expressed, or the numbers of over- and under-expressed genes on the array were equal, the root mean squared error of the adaptive method was comparable with the other two methods; all were very small. when the array contained unequal numbers of over- and under-expressed genes and when the majority of genes were differentially expressed, the rmses of the global normalization method and the lowess method were much larger than those of the adaptive method. the differences ranged from around a two fold difference when the number of under-, null, and over-expressed genes were and to more than a three fold difference when the number of under-, null, and over-expressed genes were and the rmses for the adaptive method ranged from to in log scale. we compared the histogram of observed intensities to the fitted marginal density from the adaptive method as a simple check to see whether the proposed model and the estimation procedure are in line with available data. figure shows the histograms of log and log intensities of red and green channels of the simulated data, and the curve in each plot is the estimated density obtained from the fitted model. it is seen the data fits to the model quite well. gaussian noise with sd of and were added so that the data was not generated from the same model used for analysis with the adaptive method. the rmses of the global normalization method and the lowess method remained large, while the rmses of the adaptive method remained small, ranging from to on the log scale. in the above simulation, no apparent groups could be seen in the histograms of log. better results for the adaptive method were also obtained for a simulation case where the three groups are apparent in the histogram of log. the results can be seen in figure and figure. results comparing rmses for the adaptive method, the global method and the lowess method with real data are shown in table the rmses of the adaptive method on data generated from ten different arrays ranged from to, in comparison with rmses of around using the global normalization method. the average rmse of the lowess method is almost two times that of our adaptive method, although the lowess method performed better than the global method. figure shows the histograms of log and log intensities of red and green channels of the real data, and the curve in each plot is the estimated density from the adaptive method. discussion in this paper, we propose a new method for normalization of dual-labeled arrays in cases where the number of differentially expressed genes is substantial and not necessarily symmetric in direction. the method performed effectively with both simulated and real data. we started our model building initially by introducing an unknown constant c into newton's gamma-gamma-bernoulli model. the mixture model consisted of two groups: non-differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed genes. log ~ gamma log ~ gamma     sk ~ gamma log ~ gamma log ~ gamma     ~ gamma ~ gamma we found that when the differential expression was symmetric between the two samples, the model worked well. however, the error increased significantly when the ratio of the numbers of under- to over-expressed genes shifted from in order to make the model more flexible, we modified the model by assigning different scale factors γr and γg for the red channel and green channel intensities. for this modified two-component mixture, the error still remained large. we then extended the model into a three-component mixture model listed as equations 8a-8c in the additional material. the model was then quite flexible but there were too many parameters that needed to be optimized. after we tested it with simulation data and real data, we found the estimated model was not stable and difficult to optimize. we finally simplified the model to our final model given by equations 2a-2c. when applying it to real data or simulated data, the estimates converged well close to globe optima. when different start points were used, the optimizations remained relatively robust. evaluation of normalization methods can be difficult since the true normalization factors are unknown with real data for custom arrays. we avoided this problem by synthesizing customized arrays based on real data for standard arrays containing thousands of genes. in order to make the distribution of each component group look smoother, we allowed certain range of overlap between the adjacent groups. additional sampling method was tried to divide the whole distribution range into many non-overlapping intervals. in each interval the number of genes sampled increased when the absolute value of log became larger. the model fitting results using data generated by this sampling method are listed in table and figure. we compared our adaptive method with the global method and the intensity-based lowess method. the lowess method assumes that in each intensity interval either the majority of genes are non-differentially expressed or the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes are equal. the global median normalization makes these assumptions only over the array as a whole. it is not surprising that our method performed much better that the above two methods, because the global median method only works well when the assumptions are valid while the intensity-based lowess method is only effective when there are intensity-dependent biases. correlation structure is complicated for the thousands of genes on a microarray. in our model, the intensity of each channel is conditionally independent given the scale parameter, but not marginally independent.therefore, we are not assuming the intensities in two channels are independent. although we did not generate correlated genes in our simulated data sets, correlations of genes do exist in the real data sets we tested. spatial correlations are also possible but our method is not designed for that purpose. yang et al. proposed using the lowess normalization separately within each grid on the array. our algorithm could be similarly applied within each grid to control for spatial effects. limited simulations were performed in this study. we also tried to use real data to test our method. since an appropriate data set with known normalization factor was not available, we synthesized such data sets by sub-setting large arrays in which the true normalization factor could be accurately estimated. in the process of synthesizing such small arrays we had to choose an empirical threshold to stratify the differentially expressed genes and non-differentially expressed genes. although we do not believe that the superiority shown for our algorithm depends critically on the threshold chosen nor on details of the synthesis, it would be preferable to evaluate the algorithm on real data sets with know normalization factors. although our method is designed for dual-labeled cdna array, it can be extended to single channel affymetrix chip data. the most popular normalization method for the affymetrix chip compares each array to a single base line array for probe set summaries. the assumptions behind the normalization method are that the majority of the genes are non-differentially expressed and the numbers of over- and under-expressed genes are roughly equal; the same assumptions as those for dual-labeled cdna arrays. we could treat the base line array as the'reference channel' and the other array as the'test' channel and apply our algorithm to probe set summaries. for affymetrix chip data, there are multiple base pairs in a probe set and each probe has an intensity measurement. several alternative normalization methods of affymetrix arrays utilize the probe level information. for example, method based on an'invariant set' proposed by li and wong assumes that a probe of a non-differentially expressed genes in two arrays to have similar ranks and uses an iterative procedure to identify the invariant set which presumably consists of points from non-differentially expressed genes.  our new normalization method does not require that the majority of genes be non-differentially expressed, and doesn't require multiple array replicates, dye swaps, spiked controls, or housekeeping genes. it appears much more effective than standard methods when the numbers of over- and under-expressed genes are unequal, and the majority of the genes are differentially expressed. it can be very useful for general microarray platforms when samples with very different expression profile are co-hybridized and for custom arrays where the majority of genes are likely to be differentially expressed. in both of these settings, standard normalization methods are problematic. "," normalization is a critical step in analysis of gene expression profiles. for dual-labeled arrays, global normalization assumes that the majority of the genes on the array are non-differentially expressed between the two channels and that the number of over-expressed genes approximately equals the number of under-expressed genes. these assumptions can be inappropriate for custom arrays or arrays in which the reference rna is very different from the experimental samples.  we propose a mixture model based normalization method that adaptively identifies non-differentially expressed genes and thereby substantially improves normalization for dual-labeled arrays in settings where the assumptions of global normalization are problematic. the new method is evaluated using both simulated and real data.  the new normalization method is effective for general microarray platforms when samples with very different expression profile are co-hybridized and for custom arrays where the majority of genes are likely to be differentially expressed.

41," epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders in dogs, characterized by recurrent seizures. based on underlying etiology epilepsy in dogs can be diagnosed as idiopathic or symptomatic. in idiopathic epilepsy, hereditary factors are responsible for recurrent seizures. seizures reflect an abnormal hypersynchronous electrical activity of neurons, caused by an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in the brain. most dogs with idiopathic epilepsy suffer their first seizure between one and five years of age and although any breed - including mix-breeds - can be affected, a genetic basis for idiopathic epilepsy is suggested for a number of breeds. the prevalence of epilepsy in dogs has been estimated in different studies to vary from to 5%. using current treatment protocols a significant part of epileptic dogs may still continue to suffer from seizures. better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of seizure development would allow introducing new treatment modalities. the endocannabinoid system displays numerous physiological functions. anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, the two most studied endocannabinoids, are endogenous lipid mediators that bind to the g protein coupled cannabinoid receptors type and type. cb is one of the most abundant receptors in the mammalian brain and also present in peripheral tissues. similary, cb is expressed in various tissues, especially on cells of the immune system. endocannabinoids are involved in food intake, pain sensation and memory formation, amongst others. ec system dysregulation is connected to several pathological conditions, such as alzheimer’s, parkinson’s, and huntington’s disease, obesity, ischemic brain damage and epileptic seizures. endocannabinoids are released from the postsynaptic neurons and serve as retrograde signaling molecules. generally, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling leads to decreased synaptic transmission and might therefore be involved in maintaining the seizure threshold. consequently, endocannabinoid signaling at glutamatergic synapses could have a beneficial effect in epilepsy treatment. the exact role of endocannabinoids in epilepsy pathophysiology is still unclear. a recent study found significant decreased aea concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of human epileptic patients with newly diagnosed seizures as compared to healthy controls. no differences in 2ag concentrations were observed. in another study, 2ag hippocampal tissue concentrations were increased in a rat model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus compared to control animals. the authors concluded that seizure activity in otherwise healthy rats increases endocannabinoid synthesis, possibly as a protective mechanism. although dogs appear to be an ideal model for the study of human epileptic seizures, endocannabinoids have never been measured in canine csf. we therefore hypothesized that altered csf concentrations of aea and 2ag are involved in the process of canine epilepsy. in order to prove it, aea and total arachidonyl glycerol in csf of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and in a control group of unaffected healthy dogs were measured. correlations between aea and seizure severity and disease duration were calculated.  aea and total ag were detected and quantified in nearly all of the csf samples. well in line with previous endocannabinoid measurements in csf and brain tissue, concentrations were in the picomolar range for aea and in the nanomolar range for total ag. animals suffering from idiopathic epilepsy had higher aea concentrations than control animals. no statistically significant difference was observed for total ag concentration. ie, idiopathic epilepsy. group differences of endocannabinoid concentrations were tested using the wilcoxon-test. differences were considered statistically significant when the p value was < . aea levels are presented as median and – 75% percentiles. in a subgroup of dogs with severe seizures, significantly higher aea concentration in csf were measured than in dogs with single seizure episodes. no significant difference in total ag was observed. besides seizure severeness, disease duration was also associated with higher aea concentrations in csf of dogs that suffered from idiopathic epilepsy for longer than six months presented with, – pm, whereas dogs with a history of idiopathic epilepsy for shorter than six months presented with, – pm. total ag concentrations in these subgroups were again not significantly different. other calculated correlations included age of the dogs, pretreated and untreated patients and timepoint of csf collection and did not reveal statistical significant findings. however, the number of patients in these subgroups was limited. discussion although epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases in dogs, a seizure free life cannot be achieved in many patients by current treatment options. using well known antiepileptic drugs, approximately 25% of dogs cannot be well controlled and continue to have seizures. thus, in the authors opinion new treatment options are needed and the controlled therapeutic modulation of the ec system could represent one possibility in order to treat those refractory epileptic patients. therefore, pathophysiological mechanisms of the ec system have to be better understood. ec system dysregulation appears to play a role in the process of epilepsy. in the central nervous system, endocannabinoids are released on demand from membrane phospholipid precursors at postsynaptic neurons and bind to g-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors at the presynaptic neuron after retrograde diffusion. the following signal cascade involves inhibition of cyclase activity or different types of calcium channels and activation of certain potassium channels. overall, endocannabinoid release leads to decreased synaptic transmission and might therefore be involved in maintaining the seizure threshold. in a human study examining newly-diagnosed epileptic patients, csf concentrations of aea were reduced significantly in affected patients compared to healthy controls. in contrast, aea concentrations in affected dogs were increased compared to the control group. we not only studied newly-diagnosed epileptic dogs but also dogs with a longer history of epilepsy. aea concentrations in dogs with a seizure-onset more than six months prior to csf-sampling were increased compared to those dogs with a seizure-onset within the last six months. we therefore suggest that ec system changes occur slowly and represent a counterregulatory mechanism to the pathological changes associated with epilepsy. the fact that only newly-diagnosed patients were included in the human study may explain the contradictory findings. a limitation of the current study is that the number of patients was limited in the different subgroups. in an in vivo study of neonatal rats with widespread neurodegeneration, the authors concluded that pathological events provide a stimulus for anandamide formation, finally leading to increased aea concentrations. this interpretation supports our findings of increased aea concentrations in the csf of epileptic dogs. not only the concentration of endocannabinoids but also the density of the endocannabinoid receptors seems to be altered in the cns of epileptic patients. cb receptor mrna expression was down regulated in the human hippocampus of epileptic patients compared to healthy controls. this down regulation confirms the hypothesis that protective endocannabinoid signalling is diminished in epileptic patients and may result in the incapability of increased aea concentrations to inhibit pathological hyperexcitability. in another study with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in mice, cb1-receptor down regulation in the hippocampus was only found in the acute phase, whereas in the chronic phase, an upregulation was observed. dogs with severe seizures including cluster seizures and/or status epilepticus, had significant higher aea csf concentrations compared to dogs with single seizure events. we suggest that severe seizures increase cellular aea release in order to control these seizures. if elevated aea concentrations and an activation of the ec system were partially responsible for the disease, elevated aea concentrations would have been expected to occur in all epileptic dogs including dogs with single seizure events. disease duration also influenced csf endocannabinoid concentrations. a higher concentration of aea was measured in the csf of dogs that suffered from idiopathic epilepsy for longer than six months compared to the dogs with idiopathic epilepsy for less than six months. we suggest that more aea is released over time in order to control the seizures and therefore dogs with longer disease duration show higher csf endocannabinoid concentrations. we would expect elevated aea concentrations to occur in all epileptic dogs including newly diagnosed dogs, if elevated aea concentrations and an activation of the ec system contributed to the development of the disease. despite the observed elevated aea concentration in animals suffering for less than six months from epilepsy compared to the control animals, the further increase of aea over time suggests a counterregulation of the ec system or seizure activity itself is leading to aea increase. another interesting aspect would be the exact time elapsing between the last seizure and csf sampling. because of the retrospective character of our study it was not possible to investigate this aspect. we would hypothesize that immediately after the seizure event the endocannabinoid concentration is at its highest point. such a suggestion would support our results and our hypothesis that ecs are released as a counterregulatory mechanism in order to control prolonged seizure events.  in conclusion, we demonstrated an elevation of csf aea concentrations in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. the highest aea concentrations were found in dogs with severe seizures and a long disease history. possibly, the activation of the ec system serves as a counter-mechanism in order to regulate the seizure-threshold in epilepsy. however, the ec system can either alter or be altered by seizure activity, so that further, prospective studies are warranted to investigate pathological mechanisms. despite endocannabinoids can be synthesized “on demand”, the ec system should be considered for development of new treatment strategies against epilepsy. "," epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders in dogs characterized by recurrent seizures. the endocannabinoid system plays a central role in suppressing pathologic neuronal excitability and in controlling the spread of activity in an epileptic network. endocannabinoids are released on demand and their dysregulation has been described in several pathological conditions. recurrent seizures may lead to an adverse reorganization of the ec system and impairment of its protective effect. in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol are altered in epileptic dogs. concentrations of aea and total ag were measured in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy and in unaffected, healthy control dogs using liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry.  aea and total ag were measured at pm and nm in epileptic dogs and at pm and nm in the control group, respectively. the aea difference between epileptic and healthy dogs was statistically significant. values correlated with seizure severity and duration of seizure activity. dogs with cluster seizures and/or status epilepticus and with seizure activity for more than six months displayed the highest ec concentrations.  in conclusion, we present the first endocannabinoid measurements in canine csf and confirm the hypothesis that the ec system is altered in canine idiopathic epilepsy. endocannabinoidsanandamide2-arachidonyl glycerolepilepsycerebrospinal fluidcanine ",fd0aa264-1419-4511-b944-47b2f2ea8f3a,pubmed
42," preferential killing of sick and disabled prey individuals by the predator has been the focus of many ecologists working with different predator – prey systems. in a variety of prey predator systems, diseased or weaker animals are shown to be consumed in greater proportion by predators. increased susceptibility of parasitized prey to predation, or predator preference for parasitized prey is possible under a set of conditions. where the prey species is an intermediate host and the predator is the definitive host for a parasite species, the capture of prey is often an essential part of the life cycle. therefore any mechanism that makes the prey susceptible to predation would enhance the parasite fitness. in such relationships the susceptibility induced by the parasite can be very specific towards the predator host. a mutualistic relationship can be said to exist between a predator and a parasite if the cost of harboring the parasite is less than the benefit of greater success in catching the prey. some evidence suggestive of predator-parasite mutualism comes from dhole or indian wild dog and a protozoan parasite with chital or spotted deer as the prey-host. there can be a potential problem in such a mutualistic relationship. low virulence of the parasite towards the predator host and parasite tolerance by the predator host are essential factors for the maintenance of a mutualistic relationship. however, it is possible that a virulent parasite can grow faster and invade a mild parasite population. on the other hand a parasite resistant predator can avoid the cost of parasitism but share the benefit of prey capture and therefore invade a tolerant population. either of the events can destabilize the mutualistic relationship. it is essential therefore to examine the evolutionary stability of the mutualism. in a completely randomized distribution, a mild parasite population can be easily invaded by a virulent one and a tolerant predator can be invaded by a resistant one. population viscosity, group selection and kin selection can alter the evolution of virulence. the dhole – sarcocystis system makes group selection and viscosity very likely factors in shaping the relationship. the life cycle of the parasite is very short as compared to dhole life span. dhole groups are stable and retain their territories over a long time. dhole territories are large and encompass home ranges of several chital packs. therefore the protozoan harboured by a dhole pack is very likely to be recycled to the same pack. the benefit of the parasite is more likely to be gained by the same pack. the distribution of a parasite within a pack is shown to follow a consistent pattern in which only a few individuals carry most of the parasite load. on the other hand, one or two individuals in each pack are found to be parasite free. this suggests that within a pack there can be distribution of labor.. a distribution of labor, in which some individuals do active hunting and some disseminate the parasite, can reduce the effective cost of carrying the parasite. evolution can take a different route under such conditions. we examine here the effect of parasite recycling on the evolution of a predator-parasite mutualism, using a theoretical model. the model we consider two alternative strategies, namely mild and virulent, for the parasite. the virulent parasite multiplies rapidly in the predator host and therefore enjoys greater success and exerts a higher cost on the predator host. the mild parasite exerts relatively low cost on the predator host and gains a limited success. the predator has two alternative strategies, namely tolerant and resistant. a tolerant predator always harbors the parasite population whereas the resistant one attempts to resist or eliminate the parasite. however, since the parasite virulence mechanisms also evolve, there is a probability that the parasite can infect a resistant predator. the predator gets an additional net benefit from capturing a prey infected with the parasite as compared to capturing an uninfected prey. the prey can have only one viable strategy, that of becoming resistant to the parasite. the prey will not get any benefit by tolerating the parasite since it would make it more susceptible for predation. therefore, we do not consider alternative prey strategies in the model. the table differs from pay-off matrix tables for classical game theory models. the table accounts for two alternative strategies each for two different types of players namely parasite and predator. the pay-off of the parasite is not only decided by other parasites but also by the predator strategy and vice-versa. therefore the complete pay-off of a mild parasite invading a virulent population in a tolerant host population is m *. others to be calculated similarly. if the parasite population consists of the mild type, they enjoy a fitness of'm' from the tolerant host and'p*m' from a resistant one. since they exert a cost y on the host, there is erosion of the host resource. the host resource available to them is therefore. similarly for a population of virulent parasites the mean fitness gain is v and the host resource available. a virulent host invading a mild population will gain a fitness of'v' such that v > m. in the absence of recycling the host resource available to it would be. however with a frequency of recycling'fr', the host resource would be, fr + similarly, that for a mild parasite invading a virulent population would be, fr + if the predator population is tolerant the parasite will be harbored in large numbers and disseminated to the prey population. since the parasitized prey is more susceptible to predation the predator gets a benefit'z' of easy catching. a resistant population, on the other hand has a small probability'p' of harboring the parasite. therefore the benefit the predator gets would be'p*z'. if a resistant predator invades a tolerant population, with the recycling factor'fr', the benefit of prey capture would be, fr * p *z + z. the benefit for a tolerant one invading a resistant population would be, fr * z + * p*z. we assume that'v', the benefit for a virulent parasite by infecting single host is directly proportional to'x' i.e the loss to the host from infection by virulent parasite. v = α *x similarly, m = α *y  a mild parasite will be able to invade a virulent population if the pay-off to the mild invader is greater than that for the virulent population. when the predator population is tolerant, this condition is satisfied when, y * > x the condition under which a virulent invader is unable to invade a mild population is * y > *x since x > y, for satisfying both these conditions, fr should be large, y should be moderate and x should be large. thus selection would favour a moderate virulence in the parasite towards the predator host. unlike our expectation, low virulence is unlikely to be stable. however, a mutualistic relation can remain if the prey capture benefit is sufficiently large. it can be easily seen that the above conditions remain unaffected even if the predator population is resistant. considering predator strategies, a tolerant predator will be able to invade a resistant population in the presence of a mild predator if, p *z - p*y < p *z + fr*z - y i. e. p*fr * z - p* y < fr *z - y this condition will be satisfied if fr *z > y since p < a resistant predator will be unable to invade a tolerant population since the necessary condition is z-y < *z + fr* - fr*z - y < p*fr*z - p*y this invasion is impossible if fr*z > y. if the parasite is virulent, the necessary condition would be fr*z > x. since x is assumed to be large, a resistant predator would be stable if the prevalent parasite strategy is virulent. thus when fr and z are large and y is small mutualism would be stable. when this condition is not satisfied the predator will evolve resistance to the parasite and the parasite will evolve greater virulence.  a large recycling frequency appears to be the only critical factor in the evolution of parasite virulence. however, the parasite is unlikely to evolve towards low virulence. there will be a moderate virulence optimum. for a net benefit to the host the cost associated with this level of virulence should be less than the benefit in terms of ease of prey capture. for the evolution and stability of the tolerant strategy in the predator a large fr as well as large z and small y are necessary. a predator-parasite mutualism therefore critically depends upon these factors, whereas it is independent of p and α. in the case of dhole-chital – sarcocystis system, these condition are very likely to be satisfied. field data show that the frequency of sarcocystosis of the heart in dhole kills was approximately double that of chital dyeing of other causes. this suggests a substantially large z. dhole have large, stable and defended territories upto km. there is only marginal overlap between neighboring packs unlike the overlap in tigers. the territory of a dhole pack encompasses the home ranges of several chital groups. the home ranges of chital groups are small and stable. this can ensure a large'fr'. unlike wolves, which tend to defecate more on the boundaries of the territory, the frequently used defecation sites of dhole tend to be towards the center of their home range and close to the major hunting areas, further ensuring a large'fr'. the intensity of intestinal infection is reflected in the density of sporocyst in dhole scat. dhole shading large numbers of sporocysts of s. axicuonis show no apparent symptoms of disease or abnormality. this indicates that the virulence of s. axicuonis towards dhole is low. further, the division of labor can substantially reduce the effective cost of carrying the parasite. currently we are unable to quantify these parameters empirically and have no estimate of the actual cost of harboring the parasite. therefore we are unable to state quantitatively that all the necessary conditions for mutualism are met by the system. the importance of the model is that it helps us identify the gaps in the data and thus orient future empirical work. although we are far from having an empirical estimate of y, fr and z, the known ecology of chital and dhole suggest that fr and z could be sufficiently large. this makes the system a likely candidate for the evolution of predator parasite mutualism. any other predator-prey system that satisfies these conditions is also likely to co-evolve with some parasite species towards a predator-parasite mutualism. parasites of diverse taxa have evolved predator-prey life cycles and any of them could be possible candidates for a mutualism. predator-prey-parasite systems that satisfy the following three criteria are the most likely candidates for a stable mutualistic relationship: i) parasitized prey individuals are killed with substantially greater frequency by the predator ii) pathogenicity of the parasite towards the predator host is low or moderate iii) there is a high rate of parasite recycling to the predator host. we need to look at a number of systems that could satisfy these criteria. the chital-dhole-sarcocystis system may not be unique and many possible examples of predator-parasite mutualism may be present in nature. authors' contributions both authors have contributed approximately equally to the model development. "," for parasites with a predator-prey life cycle, the completion of the life cycle often depends on consumption of parasitized prey by the predator. in the case of such parasite species the predator and the parasite have common interests and therefore a mutualistic relationship is possible. some evidence of a predator-parasite mutualism was reported from spotted deer or chital as a prey species, dhole or indian wild-dog as the predator and a protozoan as the parasite. we examine here, with the help of a model, the ecological conditions necessary for the evolution and stability of such a mutualistic relationship. a two – level game theory model was designed in which the payoff of a parasite is decided not only by alternative parasite strategies but also by alternative host strategies and vice versa. conditions for ess were examined.  a tolerant predator strategy and a low or moderately virulent parasite strategy which together constitute mutualism are stable only at a high frequency of recycling of parasite and a substantial prey – capture benefit to the predator. unlike the preliminary expectation, parasite will not evolve towards reduced virulence, but reach an optimum moderate level of virulence.  the available data on the behavioral ecology of dhole and chital suggest that they are likely to meet the stability criteria and therefore a predator-parasite mutualism can be stable in this system. the model also points out the gaps in the current data and could help directing further empirical work.

43," brucella is a genus of bacteria causing brucellosis, a zoonosis that affects a large variety of mammals and that is readily transmitted to humans. the genus includes several classical species that can be distinguished by their preferential host range, surface structure, biochemical and physiological features, and genetic markers. this classification is reflected in some degree of genetic polymorphism, one of the main sources of which is the copy number and distribution of is. b. melitensis and b. suis contain seven complete is copies. b. abortus carries six complete and one truncated is copies, b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis more than copies and b. ovis copies. is is very stable: its mobility has been demonstrated only by using a ""transposon trap"" in vitro in b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis, but not in b. melitensis and b. abortus. based on this stability, polymorphism at the alkb locus is used to differentiate b. abortus from b. melitensis, b. ovis and b. suis in the amos multiplex pcr assay. is stability is not only relevant for brucella typification: its mobility is implicated in the generation of genetic diversity and speciation, as shown by the distribution of is among the extant brucella species. here we report that is transposition and the generation of the associated polymorphism takes place in b. abortus under natural conditions, when genetic drift should be limited by the selective pressure imposed by the host.  in a previous work with b. abortus strains, it was found that two isolates displayed is profiles that were different from that typical of b. abortus field strains. this is confirmed here by the genetic profiling summarized in table and by the is southern blot presented in figure the latter shows that, while the reference strain b. abortus presented seven is711-carrying fragments, isolates b, and b b and b displayed an additional one. it is known that rb a lipopolysaccharide rough strain obtained from b. abortus by multiple in vitro passages on antibiotic containing media, harbors eight copies plus an additional one that transposed into the lipopolysaccharide wboa gene. similarly, b. abortus a strain isolated more than sixty years ago and extensively replicated in different laboratories carries eight is copies. however, the molecular weight of x-b and x-b fragments was different from those bearing the extra is copies in and rb. interestingly, whereas strain b which was isolated from the same sample as b displayed the genetic profile typical of b. abortus, strains b b and b showed an identical profile, even though they were from successive outbreaks in the same flock. these results show that it is possible to find b. abortus field isolates with different is distributions. a is profiles are shown in figure b a, b. abortus typical pattern; b, b. abortus pattern; c, b. ovis typical pattern. c b and b were isolated from the same sample. d b b and b are strains isolated from different outbreaks in the same flock. e np: not performed we characterized the insertion sites in b and b to ascertain whether they were new or already present in other brucellae. to this end, we carried out is-anchored pcr using is711-bound primers plus a decamer of %gc similar to that of the brucella genome. the resulting amplicons ranged from - kb with a similar distribution among strains, but with an additional pcr fragment for each b and b strains. considering that those fragments may contain part of the additional is copies plus their surrounding sequences, we cloned and sequenced the kb and kb dna amplicons of b and b respectively, and designed flanking primers to confirm the position of the new is copy. as predicted for the insertion of complete is copies of bp in length, specific pcr products of bp and bp were amplified. we believe that an is replicative transposition is the most plausible explanation for these results. in fact, the sequence analysis suggested that transposition had occurred by a canonical ta duplication at ytar site. in strain b this site was in an intergenic region between a lactate permease gene and bruab1_ corresponding to a bp bru-rs element, a palindromic repeat sequence that represents a putative insertion site for is. in contrast, the is extra copy in b b and b was interrupting an orf encoding a transcriptional regulator of the marr family. similarity searches showed that the b and b sites did not match with any of the is loci previously reported for b. abortus or even with the novel is sites recently described for brucella marine mammal strains, although the b site was found in b. ovis. to confirm these findings and to investigate whether these sites were also present in the genomes of the brucella species carrying a high-copy number of is we carried out pcr assays with b. ovis, b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis dnas. for the b12-specific is pcr amplifications with flanking primers yielded an is-empty locus fragment. in contrast, the pcr amplifying the b fragment yielded the predicted bp fragment in b. ovis but not in b. ceti or b. pinnipedialis. the x-b and x-b is sequences were nearly identical to that of is711_1a and depicted only changes in a few nucleotides. on the basis of the high is sequence similarity across sequenced b. abortus strains, we performed a cluster analysis between the is copies of b. abortus 9- and those additional ones found in rb b and b strains to get insight about their origin. although as expected, the analysis disclosed only low sequence dissimilarity, it suggested that the new copies might derive from is711_1a. since a previous work has shown that the is711_xa in the b. abortus alkb locus and the is711_x- in strain are identical to is711_1a, the inclusion of is711_x-b and is711_x-b in the same cluster supports the hypothesis that is711_1a is more active than other copies in the b. abortus genome and can transpose into new sites or even into sites shared with related species. is transposition can disrupt genes and produce negative polar effects, but also cause beneficial changes by remodeling genomes through long range recombination. in the case of strain b it is uncertain whether the intergenic position of is disturbs the expression of nearby genes. most is studied in detail are also located within intergenic regions showing that transposition is mostly viable when occurring into neutral sites. however, the extra is copy in b b and b interrupts a putative transcriptional regulator that is expressed during the late-logarithmic phase of growth in b. melitensis and, interestingly, these strains did not show urease activity, a factor that has been proposed to favor brucella gastrointestinal infections in mice. we investigated whether the marr mutation was involved in the urease-negative phenotype by constructing a b. abortus Δmarr mutant. this mutant displayed urease activity, suggesting that the absence of urease in b b and b is probably caused by mutation in ure genes. the fact that these urease negative marr mutant strains were repeatedly isolated from aborted fetuses for at least four years questions the relevance of this factor in placental colonization and abortion induction. research is in progress to characterize the genetic background of this urease negative phenotype.  in this report, we have provided evidence that is polymorphism occurs in b. abortus field strains. the fact that such polymorphism can take place in sites shared with related species points out the relevance of a multiple-marker approach in molecular typing of brucella species. in addition, our results suggest that the extra is copies might originate from what seems to be the most active is copy. although the environmental signals involved in the activation of the transposase remain unknown, host-pathogen interactions may play a role. further work is needed to elucidate if changes promoted by is transposition are associated with virulence fluctuations in this pathogen. "," brucellosis is a zoonosis caused by brucella spp., a group of highly homogeneous bacteria. the insertion sequence is is characteristic of these bacteria, and occurs in variable numbers and positions, but always constant within a given species. this species-associated polymorphism is used in molecular typing and identification. field isolates of b. abortus, the most common species infecting cattle, typically carry seven is copies. thus far, is transposition has only been shown in vitro and only for b. ovis and b. pinnipedialis, two species carrying a high number of is copies, but never in other brucella species, neither in vitro nor in field strains.  we found several b. abortus strains isolated from milk and aborted fetuses that carried additional is copies in two hitherto undescribed insertion sites: one in an intergenic region near to the 3' end of a putative lactate permease gene and the other interrupting the sequence of a marr transcriptional regulator gene. interestingly, the second type of insertion was identified in isolates obtained repeatedly from the same herd after successive brucellosis outbreaks, an observation that proves the stability and virulence of the new genotype under natural conditions. sequence analyses revealed that the new copies probably resulted from the transposition of a single is copy common to all brucella species sequenced so far.  our results show that the replicative transposition of is can occur under field conditions. therefore, it represents an active mechanism for the emergence of genetic diversity in b. abortus thus contributing to intra-species genetic polymorphism.

44," primordial germ cells, the precursor of gametes, have a unique migration activity in birds as well as in mammals. they temporally reside in the extra-embryonic tissue and localize into embryonic gonads. pgcs in mammals are originally derived from the epiblast of the gastrulating embryo and move into embryonic gonads through hindgut by amoeboid movement. in contrast, in birds, pgcs firstly appear from the epiblast in the blastoderm and translocate to the hypoblast of the area pellucida. during the gastrulation, they circulate through the vascular system and shuttle down into the gonadal anlagen. thus, avian pgcs can be collected from germinal crescent or blood vessel, and embryonic gonads. recently, this unique migration pattern of avian pgcs allowed producing germline chimeras by re-transplantation of the pgcs into the blood vessel of recipient embryos. morphological and physiological features of avian germ cells including pgcs have been well characterized and utilized for further studies. however, there are only a few reports on expressed sequence tag analysis and functional genomic study for avian germ cells, especially pgcs in the early embryonic developmental stages. pgc is an important cell type, in which either gene expression or suppression should be regulated temporally and spatially during embryonic developments. according to gene expression switching triggered by interactions with environmental niche, pgcs could maintain their pluripotency or differentiate into germ cells. however, due to technical difficulties, no further progress has been made in functional genomic study and massive novel gene mining in avian pgcs as well as neighboring stroma cells. therefore, this study was conducted to investigate a large-scale est analysis in chicken macs-separated pgcs and compared the expression of the pgc ests with that of embryonic gonad.  retrieval of chicken pgcs by macs treatment embryonic gonads were retrieved from total white leghorn embryos at days of incubation and then the retrieved gonadal cells were treated with magnetic activated cell sorter for separation of pgcs in total embryonic gonadal cells. pgc population ratio after macs separation increased folds than that before macs. thus, we collected × pgcs from embryos for total rna preparation and cdna library construction. the population ratio of chicken pgcs in embryonic gonads was approximately %. so, it is difficulty and complicated to retrieve a large number of chicken pgcs at the early embryonic stages. thus, in this study, gene expression profiling of chicken pgcs was conducted and analyzed with macs-separated chicken pgcs. the morphological and physiological properties of pgcs were unchanged even after macs separation. macs-separated pgcs has the reactivity to germ cell-specific antibodies and the migration capacity into embryonic gonads after re-transplantation into the recipient embryos. cdna library construction from chicken pgcs and est sequencing after in vivo excision with e. coli strain solr, insert sizes of the cdna libraries from pgcs were analyzed by pcr and insert fragments ranged from to kb. titer of primarily cdna library was approximately × pfu/ml on average. subsequently, we massively sequenced ests from pgc cdna library and total ests were sequenced. of ests, sequences were excluded due to low sequencing quality and after vector sequence trimming. thus, finally were used for computational analysis. ests processing and assembling we have sequenced cdna clones from macs-separated chicken pgc population cdna library generating sequences. the est data that are described in this paper have been submitted to the ncbi dbest under accession nos. dr410159-dr assembling and clustering of the est data resulted in unique sequences with contigs and singlets. filtering out possible chimeric sequences with similarity search against chicken genomic sequences were removed contigs and singlets resulting in total sequences with contigs and singlets. since the genomic sequences do not have % coverage and accuracy, some of the filtered sequences might be genuine sequences but did not correspond with the genomic sequence draft. average number of ests per contig was about. on the other hands, clustering and assembling of embryonic gonad ests were resulted in total unique sequences; contigs and singlets, respectively. average est numbers per a contig were approximately in assemblies of embryonic gonad ests. the unique sequences of the two different sets described in this paper are available at chicken primordial germ cell ests. gene ontology annotation and putative novel transcripts the number of putative novel transcripts obtained by comparing with the gggi was total sequences with contigs and singlets. as it was not a cross-species sequence comparison, strict criteria as described in the method were applied to the cut-off values. for the same reason, identifying the putative novel transcripts can be seen as non-strict criteria. the reason for applying the strict threshold was to avoid blast hit with paralogous sequences. functional prediction and gene ontology distribution on the basis of sequence similarity search against non-redundant protein database of the ncbi are shown in additional file and additional file 2a. interestingly, pearson chi-square test of independence of 2nd level go terms between pgcs and novel transcripts data set indicates that a large portion of cellular component unknown term in cellular components would be involved in gene expression of pgcs. in addition, there were higher portion of behavior and development in biological process, and obsolete molecular function and transporter activity in the novel transcripts than those of pgc set. digital gene expression profiling while the comparison of the pearson chi-square test of particular go terms is based on non-redundant data sets, digital gene expression profiling is based upon quantitative differences between two different datasets. using the audic's test, digital gene expression profiling is showed in table there were genes expressed significantly higher number of transcripts in pgcs compared with embryonic gonads set. on the contrary, genes in embryonic gonads were up-regulated higher than those in pgc set. nadh dehydrogenase subunit gene, one of two pgc-highly expressed genes, was located in chicken mitochondrial genome and its product was partially related to sperm activity regulated by mitochondrial functions, but 40s ribosomal protein sa was not reported in germ cell expression yet. interestingly, 40s ribosomal protein sa or 37lrp/p was closely associated to invasive and metastatic activity in cancer cells. during the formation of the undifferentiated gonads, pgcs actively penetrate into gonadal epithelium through blood vessel. even after settled down in embryonic gonads, they invade from cortical layer into medullar tissue by active migration activity. thus, it might be assumed that 40s ribosomal protein sa is involved in active pgc mobility. however, further study should be conducted to elucidate its function in pgcs. among gonad-highly expressed genes, several genes such as calmodulin, eukaryotic translation elongation factor alpha, ribosomal proteins, thioredoxin, ras homolog, transforming growth factor beta, and vimentin were previously characterize the expression patterns in embryonic gonads as a supportive environmental niche for pgc in other species. abdallah et al. reported that the somatic form of eukaryotic translation elongation factor alpha mrna is virtually undetectable in male and female germ cells of the adult gonad but is very abundant in embryonic cells after the neurula stage in xenopus laevis. moreover, the translation pattern of the ef- alpha is coordinated translational regulation with ribosomal proteins in xenopus laevis during embryogenesis. it is very reasonable result of the up-regulation of antioxidant proteins, thioredoxin, in embryonic gonads because embryonic gonad is more susceptible to oxidant induced damage than adult organs. li et al. showed that in drosophila, the receptor tyrosine kinase torso activates both stat and ras during the early phase of pgc development, and co-activation of stat and ras is required for pgc proliferation and invasive migration. members of the transforming growth factor beta family are pleiotropic cytokines with key roles in tissue morphogenesis and growth and potential roles for tgf beta have been identified in gonad and secondary sex organ development, spermatogenesis and ovarian function. vimentin has been known as an immunohistological marker of sertoli cells which shows over expression during embryonic stage. in mammalian species, ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin was well-known as an activator of fertilized embryo and also was closely related to regulation of interaction between germ cells and neighboring environments at embryonic stages as well as at sexual maturity. we also conducted the alternative serial experiment for gene expression profiling using the massively parallel signature sequencing from pgcs and embryonic gonads. using a fdr cut-off of, we found and signatures were significantly up-regulated in the pgcs and gonad sample, respectively. exact binomial probabilities for the situations of n out of n genes were calculated in each sample using the standard binomial formula, where the n is the number of genes identified using ests in each sample, and the probability that the differentially expressed gene of ests will exist in the same sample type of the mpss is the proportion of the des among total mpss in each sample. interestingly, the up-regulated signatures in the pgcs contained the two genes identified using ests in the pgcs. the exact binomial probability of exactly out of was e- with given des proportion in the pgcs. the up-regulated signatures in the embryonic gonads also contained all of the genes identified using ests in the embryonic gonads. the exact binomial probability of exactly out of was e- with given des proportion in the gonads. thus, although the differentially expressed genes identified with ests data was relatively small number, the binomial probabilities indicated that the mpss result was very consistent with the result from the ests data.  in this study, we could characterize expression gene profiling and identify the significant transcripts expressed in chicken primordial germ cells as well as embryonic gonads at days. in the near future, serial experiments will be needed to evaluate biological function and to elucidate interaction in germ cells or a supportive stroma cells during the early embryo development. germ cell is not only a unique and important cell type compared to other tissues, but also the only cell type that can penetrate from one generation to next generation. furthermore, at the early embryonic developmental stages, the onset of proliferation and differentiation, germ cell is very tightly regulated by triggering or suppressing the essential genes. however, collection of germ cells from embryonic stages in aves is very difficulty and complicated and so there are few reports on gene transcript profiling in germ cells retrieved from the embryos to date. thus, the results in this study would be contributed to investigating the reciprocal interaction between genes during germ cell proliferation and differentiation, and accelerating novel gene mining in germ cells. "," germ cells are the only cell type that can penetrate from one generation to next generation. at the early embryonic developmental stages, germ cells originally stem from primordial germ cells, and finally differentiate into functional gametes, sperm in male or oocyte in female, after sexual maturity. this study was conducted to investigate a large-scale expressed sequence tag analysis in chicken pgcs and compare the expression of the pgc ests with that of embryonic gonad.  we constructed ests from a chicken cdna library of a collection of highly separated embryonic pgcs. after chimeric and problematic sequences were filtered out using the chicken genomic sequences, there were resulting unique sequences consisting of contigs and singlets. pearson chi-square tests of gene ontology terms in the 2nd level between pgc and embryonic gonad set showed no significance. however, digital gene expression profiling using the audic's test showed that there were genes expressed significantly with higher number of transcripts in pgcs compared with the embryonic gonads set. on the other hand, genes in embryonic gonads were up-regulated higher than those in the pgc set.  our results in this study contribute to knowledge of mining novel transcripts and genes involved in germline cell proliferation and differentiation at the early embryonic stages.

45," majority of the mycobacterial species that cause human and animal tuberculosis are grouped together as members of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. this mycobacterium tuberculosis complex includes very closely related species of mycobacteria among them: m. tuberculosis, m. africanum, m. microti, m. bovis, m. caprae, m. canettii and m. pinnipedii. although m. tuberculosis infection is the most common cause of human tuberculosis, part of other proportion of cases are due to m. bovis. zoonotic tuberculosis is caused mainly by m. bovis that has been shown to have a very wide host range. the specie has been documented throughout the world with a similar impact in terms of disease occurrence. in zambia, btb is not homogenously distributed, however, high prevalence rates have been recorded within and around the kafue basin where there is extensive overlap in terms of grazing land for both wild and domestic animals. additionally, the kafue lechwe antelopes found in the kafue basin have been described as feral reservoirs of btb in zambia. the disease has a historical presence in the kafue basin that predates the identification of the area as a protected ecosystem and ramsar site no.. despite the continued reduction in annual rainfall figures under the effects of global warming, the kafue basin still remains as one of the few lucurstrine wetland ecosystems in zambia and africa, supporting a surging cattle population estimated at animals, at a carrying density of animals per square kilometre and approximately lechwe antelopes on a square kilometre wetland. the area is characterised by high btb with a herd level prevalence of around 50%, whereas a comparatively lower herd prevalence averaging % has been determined in areas outside the basin. likewise, the corresponding kafue lechwe antelopes have been shown to have a higher btb prevalence rate, raising questions on a possible interspecies transmission of the disease between cattle and kafue lechwe antelopes. this is however hampered by the lack of direct evidence to conclusively ascertain this assertion. sequencing of the whole genome of the members of mtc has shown a high level of sequence homogeneity among the members. thus a careful and detailed comparative exploration into the individual genomes of the members of this complex was employed to mine out significant differences for diagnostic capabilities. comparative genome analysis informed us that m. bovis has a smaller genome compared with m. tuberculosis. furthermore, m. bovis has over time lost off some genes compared to m. tuberculosis. these genomic insertion-deletions are commonly referred to as regions of difference and have been used in speciation of members of this complex as well as in explaining the evolution of the mtcs. spoligotyping diagnostic technique highlights intra species differences determined by the loss of spacers at a direct repeat region in mtcs, thereby creating a fingerprint typical of a particular specie. additionally, it is a more rapid and specific method of mtc speciation apart from being less laborious compared with biochemical, phenotypic and is6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. spoligotyping results are very practical and reproducible across different laboratories internationally. the technique has developed considerably and it is marked by a system of nomenclature and strain data capture and identification with a huge geographical and epidemiological relevance worldwide. most strains of m. bovis have one copy of is and spoligotyping is in general more discriminative when used with methods based on pcr amplification of the loci containing variable number tandem repeats. the target of this study was to molecularly characterize a population sample of m. bovis from cattle and kafue lechwe antelopes in zambia to determine the genetic diversity and relatedness of the isolates from domestic animals and wildlife.  isolation and confirmation of m. bovis by mtcd-mpcr a total of specimens from cattle and from lechwe antelopes were analysed to initially determine the prevalence of mtc species. the samples were collected based on observations of gross pathological lesions upon examination. the observations included generalized lesions involving the lungs, pleural and mediastinal lymph nodes in both lechwe and cattle. these tuberculous lesions were observed by other workers who were investigating gross pathological distribution of tuberculous lesions in both cattle and lechwe. from the samples analysed, mtc strains were obtained with isolates from cattle and from lechwe. following isolation m. bovis was confirmed by screening using the mtcd-mpcr analysis as previously observed. the mtcd-mpcr technique is very useful in the differentiation of mtc at whatever level of diagnosis as it is simple and specific. the presence of m. bovis in wildlife may translate into a perpetual focus of the disease considering that btb control in wild animals is a very difficult undertaking. the only workable solution would be to intensify btb testing in domestic animals so that reactors are removed. furthermore traditional cattle herders must also be informed of the dangers of grazing their animals in areas where lechwe antelopes are present. spoligotyping and multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis spoligotyping of the m. bovis isolates revealed their molecular clonality. two major spoligotype patterns were observed accounting for isolates, and isolates cattle and lechwe respectively. two isolates not identifiable with the two major clusters was given an sb under the global spoligotype patterns diversity provided by the international data base on spoligotyping. this only accounted for 4% of the observed isolates. m. bovis strains from both cattle and lechwe of the kafue basin were found to share the same spoligotype. this spoligotype was previously reported to be the major strain circulating in cattle around the kafue basin, although by that time, no strains were determined from wild animals. m. bovis strains isolated outside the kafue basin were found to share a different cluster. all the isolates lacked spacers and to a characteristic feature that distinguishes m. bovis from m. tuberculosis. molecular studies have previously shown that clonality implies active transmission of disease. thus our results in the kafue basin where there was high clonality between isolates from lechwe and cattle, suggest an active transmission of m. bovis between the two animal species. the spoligotyping results showed that sb clustered outside the kafue basin suggesting that none of the lechwe antelopes harboured m. bovis with such a spoligo pattern. mlva analysis identified distinct clusters, which are corresponding to either sb or sb. within the cluster possessing the spoligo pattern sb there were groups and strain distinguishable one another by loci, miru and qub the cluster possessing the spoligotype sb was differentiated in groups. nineteen strains, from lechwe and from cattle, consisted of a major group and other groups or singletons were discriminated from the major group by a single mlva locus difference each. the spoligotype sb seems to be a descendant pattern of sb lacking spacer and also clustered in sb group with locus difference. the high isolation frequency of spoligotype sb in cattle and lechwe conforms to the finding of previous works from zambia and may demonstrate dominance of this spoligotype despite the small sample size. the sb spoligotype has a considerable degree of geographical dispersion in zambia and other african countries such as algeria and south africa. this spoligotype is also common in continental europe. such a strain could have been introduced through livestock development schemes of trying to improve african beef local breeds. this finding has been highlighted by different workers. spoligotype sb has been reported in this work for the first time in zambia. this spoligotype has been documented in south africa, which has a close livestock trade link with zambia. to our knowledge, this is the first study conducting molecular characterization of m. bovis strains from cattle and lechwe in zambia. however, routine studies have already previously revealed the presence of btb in these animals. in this study, results have shown genetic relatedness between m. bovis in cattle and lechwe antelopes of the kafue basin. it is important to note that the area around lochnivar national park was used for ranching purposes by the early settlers from south africa. this area was only gazetted as an animal sanctuary in it is the only place where kafue lechwe antelopes antelopes are confined. the animals are semi-aquatic living in large groups near water and as such are confined to the area shown in figure . characterization of m. bovis strains based on molecular tools is important in understanding the epidemiology of btb. these results are significant in understanding the transmission and dispersion of m. bovis strains within zambia, given the high level of internal migration by the local people from the southern part of the country to the central and northern regions of zambia with their cattle. this type of internal migration may lead to the dispersion of the sb strain which in this present study was found confined to the southern regions of zambia.  the current study has described the possible source of m. bovis in wildlife and the transmission of limited strains of m. bovis between cattle and lechwe. the identified maintenance and spread of m. bovis may become a dynamic and highly active process considering that human activities allow movement of cattle from one location to another. "," in zambia, the presence of bovine tuberculosis in both wild and domestic animals has long been acknowledged and mutual transmission between them has been predicted without any direct evidence. elucidation of the circulating mycobacterium bovis strains at wild and domestic animals interphase area in zambia, where bovine tuberculosis was diagnosed in wildlife seemed to be important.  a pcr identified and m. bovis isolates from lechwe and cattle, respectively. spoligotype analysis revealed that m. bovis strains from lechwe and cattle in kafue basin clustered into a major node sb where isolates outside the kafue basin clustered into different nodes of sb and sb the comparatively higher variety of strains in cattle compared to lechwe elucidated by mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units–variable number tandem repeats analyses are consistent with cattle being the probable source of m. bovis in wild and domestic animals interphase area in zambia.  these results provide strong evidence of m. bovis strains transfer between cattle and lechwe, with the latter having developed into a sylvatic reservoir host. bovine tuberculosiscattlemycobacterium bovisstrainswildlifekobus leche kafuensis ",a36b4223-e128-4d18-bb77-b94f8b3d7d96,pubmed
46," endocrine therapy is a highly effective form of adjuvant therapy for hormone sensitive breast cancer. currently, the three classes of commonly used drugs for adjuvant endocrine therapy are selective estrogen receptor modulators, selective estrogen receptor down-regulators, and aromatase inhibitors. unfortunately, tumor cells often develop resistance to endocrine therapy, representing a major obstacle limiting the success of breast cancer treatment. to better understand the biology and molecular mechanisms that underlie endocrine resistance, we and others have developed tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cell models. we demonstrated that dramatically different molecular mechanisms underlie progression to resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant and also identified specific genes and biochemical pathways associated with serm- and serd-resistance. recently, micrornas, a novel noncoding rna class, have been shown to be key regulators of various biological processes and diseases. in breast cancer, alterations in expression of mirnas appear to play important roles in drug resistance and thus may represent new therapeutic targets. furthermore, the role of specific mirnas in antiestrogen resistant breast cancer has been investigated by us and others, and both rao et al. and miller et al. demonstrated a critical role for mir-221/ in serm and serd resistances as well as a key role in estrogen receptor alpha biology and function. in this follow-up study, we took a global approach to further investigate the role of mirnas in resistance to these important endocrine therapies. although methods for the functional analysis of mirnas are publicly available, systematic global view of the networks of these key epigenetic regulators has not been fully explored. systems biology approaches have recently been used to examine mirna-mediated pathogenic dys-regulation and oestrogen-regulated mirnas; however, this approach has only recently been used to investigate breast cancer drug resistance, one of the most lethal cancers in women. here, we present an integrative view of “antiestrogen resistance-related mirna-mrna regulation” and discuss functional roles of this previously un-described network. the network was reconstructed by combining cancer contexts and expression profiles for mirnas and mrnas. furthermore, in order to minimize false positives in the network construction, we utilized experimental evidence-based prior knowledge databases, including mirna-target mrna relations and mirna upstream regulators in mirna promoters). the use of cancer contexts provided further biological interpretability for the network construction. to simplify the network, we determined the underlying substructures. notably, in addition to the known mir-221/222-mediated network cluster, we identified novel mirna-related network clusters associated with antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer. interestingly, the novel network clusters contained genomic instability, a recently described hallmark of cancer and area of intense interest in the breast cancer field.  overview our goal was to identify a global mirna-regulated landscape in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines compared to mcf. to improve the reliability of our approach, experimentally validated mirna-related databases were used to construct an “evidence-based” mirna-mrna network. the network consisted of mirnas, their targets, transcription factors binding to mirna promoters, and signaling molecules upstream of mirnas. we further expanded the network by associating it with biological contexts, including the important hallmarks of cancer. the associations were inspected by utilizing a text-mining tool, pubgene. subsequently, the expression data for both mirnas and mrnas were incorporated into the network. in order to observe differential usage of the fully integrative network, we examined two different drug resistance states and then refine topologically important network clusters underscoring the network. the details are described in methods. integrative network description the integrative network demonstrated that the entries were extensively interconnected with eight cancer-related hallmarks, suggesting that mirna-driven epigenetic changes in these hallmarks contributed to the resistance of mcf cells to antiestrogens. furthermore, both common and differential network usages were observed between the two drug resistance states. to validate the network regulations, we used the mean correlation across all the edges as a statistic and performed node label permutations. as a result, the regulations or the associations in the network were statistically significant at p-value. network cluster analysis to further identify important network clusters associated with tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistance, we dissected the integrative network by using a cytoscape plug-in, clustermaker. this analysis resulted in non-orphan network clusters. we then selected the top largest clusters having at least five elements. as cluster showed the strong associations with cancer hallmarks, we examined this cluster in greater detail. cluster contained both differential and common usages by mirnas and their targets. the mirnas and mrnas relating to the two drug resistant states were associated specifically with various cancer contexts, drug resistance neoplasm, glycolysis, receptors cytokine). mir-146a was down-regulated in both drug resistant cell lines, and its targets, brca1/ were up-regulated in the cluster. mir-146a is considered to function as a tumor suppressor in a tissue-dependent context, while brca1/ are well known tumor suppressors involved in maintaining genome-integrity, cell cycle, and dna damage response. despite up-regulation of these tumor suppressor genes, which would contribute to increased genome stability, it is possible that tsg binding partners could negatively affect genome maintenance. therefore, we examined expression changes of brca1/ partners in the two resistant cells compared to mcf as shown in additional file expression of brca1/ binding partners was deregulated. a recent study proposed that excess of error-free homologous recombination, a critical process for maintaining genomic integrity, can result in genomic instability and that fine-tuning may be coordinated in the ddr pathway, dna repair, chromosome segregation, and cell cycle control. thus, during development of resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant, brca1/ binding partner expression changes may be detrimental not only to cell cycle checkpoint but also to the ddr pathway, an important pathway in genomic stability. although tsgs brca and brca were up-regulated in mcf7-f and mcf7-t compared to the parental mcf cell line, brca1/ up-regulation may affect fine-tuning of genomic integrity. as mutations are also known to be critical for drug resistance, we examined publicly known somatic mutations associated with cluster somatic mutation of pik3ca in mcf has been reported in the cosmic database and recent studies have reported an association between pik3ca mutation and breast cancer drug resistance. our analysis of the two sublines indicates that pi3k/akt mutation resulting in signaling activation may contribute to the development of antiestrogen resistance. such pi3k/akt activation may also induce phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and nuclear export of chk, resulting in genomic instability. we further speculate that pik3ca mutation in mcf cells could acquire gain-of-function during development of antiestrogen resistance, resulting in genomic instability and contributing to the resistant phenotypes. interestingly, akt activation has been reported to cause genomic instability via nuclear localization of brca, and pi3kca mutation could affect ddr pathway by brca protein localization. mir-27a and mir- by regulating their targets, were involved in mesh terms emt, glycolysis, drug resistance neoplasm, cell death, and receptors cytokines. mir-27a is known to induce paclitaxel-resistance in ovarian cancer cells by targeting hipk followed by reduced mdr expression. thus, it is tempting to speculate that fulvestrant resistance may possibly share the same mechanism with paclitaxel. mir- was slightly up-regulated in mcf7-t and down-regulated in mcf7-f. by repressing various targets, mir- has been known to negatively regulate emt and metastasis via stat and igf1r. in our previous study, we validated that mcf7-f cells had not only reduced cell-cell contacts but increased malignant morphology and characteristics compared to the other two cell lines, indicating that mcf7-f underwent emt and further malignancy. cluster further indicates a key role for mir- down-regulation in fulvestrant resistance, perhaps due to altered regulation of emt and malignant progression. in addition, because igf1r is not only an upstream regulator of metabolism but also regulates stat mir- may represent a key regulator of both metabolism and a signaling pathway. in summary, cluster shows that mir-146a and brca1/ are shared molecular characteristics of the tamoxifen and the fulvestrant resistances and are closely associated in terms of the ddr pathway. mir- may contribute to the differences in epigenetic background between the two distinct forms of antiestrogen resistance. clusters and describe the differential two drug-resistant states in terms of mirna-target interaction, because the two mirnas and their targets show opposite expression. in particular, mir- plays an important role both in cancer as well as in stem cell biology, inducing emt and thus contributing to migration, invasion, and morphological change. mir- up-regulation is also consistent in the cell morphology changes associated with acquired antiestrogen resistance. mcf7-t cells grow as tightly packed colonies with limited cell spreading, while mcf7-f cells, by contrast, show reduced cell-cell contacts compared with mcf or mcf7-t cells and are loosely attached to the culture surface. thus, the target genes of the mirna in this cluster could be involved in emt as well as in malignant transformation of mcf7-f. in addition, expression of the tfs upstream of mir- was differentially changed between the two drug resistant cell lines and the differential tf usage could also contribute expression changes of this mirna. in cluster mir- and its targets showed opposite expression patterns in mcf7-t and mcf7-f and thus could contribute to the different drug-resistant states. as the majority of studies indicate that mir- is an oncogene, this mirna could play a role in acquired resistance to tamoxifen. however, depending on the biological context, it has been suggested that mir- may have a tumor suppressor role. thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that different cellular contexts could also contribute to the distinct drug-resistant phenotypes. clusters and have the same expression patterns between mcf7-t and -f, implying that the three clusters could be involved in common molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to serms and serds. let-7b, mir-15a, and mir-125b were up-regulated in both antiestrogen-resistant cell lines. in particular, mir-125b has been reported to play important roles in drug-resistance and may be an oncogene in breast cancer. experimental validation of the functional roles of mir-125b target mrnas during acquired antiestrogen resistance is ongoing in our laboratory. clusters and were of interest in terms of mutual regulatory loops. the mir- and cdkn1b loop in cluster was conserved in mcf7-t and -f in terms of expression, while sip and mir- in cluster showed an opposite expression pattern. in particular, mir- in cluster is closely aligned with erα status and antiestrogen resistance.  we applied a systems biology approach to mcf7-derived drug resistant cell lines by utilizing mirnas, mrnas and text-mining. by using the systems approach to examine global mirna-target mrna network in the context of the hallmarks of cancer, we identified several important network clusters involved not only in antiestrogen resistance mechanisms but also in differentiating resistance to serms and serds. to date, only mir-221/ has been shown to be involved in serm- and serd-resistance as well as in erα status. our computation reveals that multiple microrna-related network clusters, in addition to the mir-221/ network cluster, may contribute to antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells. recent reports appropriately advocate the need for validating mirna microarray data. despite this limitation of the current study, we utilized mirna-oriented network as well as cancer contexts to implement a systems biology approach in the field of breast cancer and antiestrogen resistance. "," a major goal of the field of systems biology is to translate genome-wide profiling data into interpretable functional networks. however, employing a systems biology approach to better understand the complexities underlying drug resistance phenotypes in cancer continues to represent a significant challenge to the field. previously, we derived two drug-resistant breast cancer sublines from the mcf breast cancer cell line and performed genome-wide mrna and microrna profiling to identify differential molecular pathways underlying acquired resistance to these important antiestrogens. in the current study, to further define molecular characteristics of acquired antiestrogen resistance we constructed an “integrative network”. we combined joint mirna-mrna expression profiles, cancer contexts, mirna-target mrna relationships, and mirna upstream regulators. in particular, to reduce the probability of false positive connections in the network, experimentally validated, rather than prediction-oriented, databases were utilized to obtain connectivity. also, to improve biological interpretation, cancer contexts were incorporated into the network connectivity.  based on the integrative network, we extracted “substructures” representing the drug resistant states compared to drug sensitive state. we identified un-described network clusters that contribute to antiestrogen resistance consisting of mir-146a, -27a, - - - -15a, -125b, and let-7s, in addition to the previously described mir-221/  by integrating mirna-related network, gene/mirna expression and text-mining, the current study provides a computational-based systems biology approach for further investigating the molecular mechanism underlying antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells. in addition, new mirna clusters that contribute to antiestrogen resistance were identified, and they warrant further investigation. bioinformaticsmirnanetworkbreast cancerantiestrogen resistance ",53e98f6f-3c10-46cd-81db-da47b90a3464,pubmed
47," streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading pathogen in bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in humans worldwide. in many european countries the rate of resistance of s. pneumoniae to macrolides has exceeded that of penicillin. concerning penicillin, it has been described that treatment of patients with nonmeningeal invasive pneumococcal infections with nonsusceptible isolates was not associated with higher mortality rates. in new penicillin breakpoints for s. pneumoniae were published by the clsi, differentiating meningitis and non-meningitis cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. their impact on susceptibility categorisation in germany was described previously by our group. however, for macrolides an increased risk of macrolide failure has been reported for pneumococcal isolates nonsusceptible in vitro. the aim of this study was to evaluate macrolide susceptibility of all isolates of s. pneumoniae with ipd that were sent to the german national reference center for streptococci between and and to evaluate potential trends in nonsusceptibility over time. the description of serotype specific resistance, was a major aim of the study. the study was undertaken against the background of the recent observation of declining macrolide resistance rates especially among german children. methods study design the nrcs has conducted surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in germany since a population- and laboratory-based approach was used to collect data on invasive pneumococcal disease among children < years and adults ≥ years in germany. isolates were sent to the nrcs by diagnostic microbiological laboratories throughout germany on a voluntary basis. cases from january to december were included in this study. a case of ipd was defined by the isolation of s. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. microbiological investigations isolates were identified by standard procedures including bile solubility and optochin sensitivity. minimal inhibitory concentrations testing was performed using the broth microdilution method as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. macrolide resistance was investigated using erythromycin or clarithromycin, in which testing with erythromycin was replaced by clarithromycin over the years. isolates were tested both for erythromycin and clarithromycin. the susceptible, intermediate, and resistant breakpoints were ≤,, and ≥ μg/ml, both for erythromycin and clarithromycin. streptococcus pneumoniae atcc was used as a control strain. statistical analysis

all invasive isolates are illustrated in figure overall, the leading serotypes were serotypes,, 7f, and 23f. a ranking of serotype specific macrolide nonsusceptibility of ipd isolates is shown in table serotype was by far the most resistant serotype, followed by serotypes rough, 19b,, 6b, 15a, 19f, and 19a. however, absolute numbers for rough, 19b and were very low. serotypes contributing considerably to pneumococcal macrolide nonsusceptibility by combination of frequency among invasive isolates and relatively high macrolide nonsusceptibility are especially serotypes 6b, 19f, 19a, 9v and 23f. the development of nonsusceptibility of these serotypes over the years is shown in figure the nonsusceptibility among serotype isolates increases considerably over the years up to around 80%. for serotype 19f a significant increase in nonsusceptibility was observed as well. no significant trends were found for serotypes 6b, 9v, 19a and 23f. the peak in nonsusceptibility among 7-, 10- and 13-valent serotypes in adults from to correlates to an increased incidence of serotype during that time. generally, the rate of resistance is higher among the vaccine serotypes than among the non vaccine serotypes. the proportion of nonsusceptible 7-valent vaccine serotypes remained largely constant from to among children. among the non pcv serotypes the rate of nonsusceptibility is lower. concerning adults, an increase of isolates sent to the nrcs can be noticed. the fraction of nonsusceptible isolates has declined during the last years among 7-valent vaccine serotypes after a notable increase from to. discussion and  this paper presents the results of years of surveillance for macrolide susceptibility of invasive pneumococcal disease in germany. the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant s. pneumoniae continues to increase worldwide but varies widely between countries. in europe, high resistance rates for macrolides have been reported from france, spain, italy and belgium. pneumococcal macrolide resistance rates reported from germany were low. nevertheless, a continuous and statistically significant increase of macrolide nonsusceptibility could be observed after publication of these studies, reaching maximum values in. the relatively high rate of variation in resistance among childhood isolates during the first years of the study is presumably due to the low number of cases, and a suspected bias for resistant isolates among the centers sending the isolates. since a considerable and statistically significant decrease especially for childhood nonsusceptibility has been noticed. these data are similar to those recently reported from spain, where a reduction of erythromycin nonsusceptibility from % in to % in has been described. an increased awareness of ipd among adults has been observed since this correlates to the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < years in germany at the end of july and an increased interest in serotype information of ipd. furthermore, in january an internet based laboratory sentinel system was established in germany, which enables participating laboratories to transfer anonymised basic patient information on a voluntary basis. compared to children, only a minor reduction of nonsusceptibility has been observed among adults from to, although this reduction was also statistically significant. possible reasons for the decrease in macrolide nonsusceptibility include a reduced macrolide consumption due to the rising resistance rates, as well as the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < years in germany at the end of july since the introduction of the vaccine a considerable decrease of serotypes included in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been observed among german children, but also among adults, which is partly due to the association of serotypes with age. the antibiotic prescribing practices, which are thought to be among the most significant drivers for the spread of pneumococcal resistance, differ vastly between european countries. a decrease in the use of macrolides has been reported for instance in spain, portugal, belgium, slovenia and taiwan. the influence of a decreased macrolide consumption on macrolide susceptibility is discussed controversially. in spain a relation between the decrease in macrolide consumption and the decrease in erythromycin non-susceptibility among children could be shown, while this effect was absent among the adult population, probably due to the increase in non-vaccine serotypes such as 19a. reports from other countries showed no decrease in macrolide nonsusceptibility following a reduced macrolide consumption. besides the total macrolide consumption, the influence of long lasting macrolides, which may increase even in times of decreasing total macrolide consumption, is discussed to be a cause of the macrolide nonsusceptibility. besides antibiotics, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is another important factor associated with changes in macrolide susceptibility. in our study, high rates of serotype specific resistance among the more frequent serotypes were observed among the serotypes 6b, 19f and 23f, in particular. these results are in line with results from germany published previously by the nrcs for invasive and respiratory tract isolates and comparable to results reported from several european countries. notably, a statistically significant trend in increasing macrolide resistance was seen for serotypes and 19f. however, since both serotypes are included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, a future reduction of these serotypes can be expected. the low rate of macrolide nonsusceptibility among isolates not serotyped corresponds to the fact, that high resistance levels were a main trigger for initiation of serotyping during the early years of this study, when consistent serotyping of all isolates was not conducted due to excessive costs. in spite of all these observations, because the impact of preventive and therapeutic strategies on pneumococcal evolution not only depends on, but also influences the serotype distribution, when normal temporal and regional variations of serotype distribution are taken into consideration, future developments remain difficult to predict. ongoing nationwide surveillance is necessary to observe further developments of pneumococcal macrolide resistance in germany. authors' contributions mi performed the analysis and drafted the manuscript. cm performed the statistical analysis. mi, rrr and ml participated in the laboratory analyses. mi, rrr and ml conceived the study. all authors read and approved

48," bradykinin is a vasoactive peptide released from its high molecular weight precursors, the kininogens, through the action of serine proteases, the kallikreins, playing a crucial role in pathologic processes like inflammation, infectious diseases, and cancer. the brain and spinal cord contain all of the components necessary for kinin formation and action. in addition, central nervous system traumas lead to kinin formation. bk type- receptors are mostly expressed in pathological or stressful situations related to tissue damage including tumors. the bk type- receptor is defined as a constitutive one, being normally encountered in many tissues, including the brain. it is well known that the blood-brain barrier in brain tumor regions shows different plasma protein extravasation characteristics when compared with the bbb of normal brain tissue and this effect is particularly related to the increase of b receptors. in animal models, b receptor agonists like cereport® have been used by the intracarotid route to enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the brain tumor area. b receptor agonists with low metabolic resistance have already been unsuccessfully tested on ppe extravasation through the btb in brain tumors. the b receptor agonist, sar-des-arg9bk, shows some resistance to enzymatic degradation that is due to the addition of amino acids to the amino-terminal portion of the molecule. thus, it is possible that sar could be successful in promoting ppe through the btb, having potential uses in enhancing the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to brain tumors. in order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of sar on ppe using the rat c glioma model.  eighty percent of c6-inoculated animals developed brain tumors after a period of days. we determined ppe in experimental groups of animals treated with bradykinin, the bk receptor b agonist or the bk receptor b antagonist. ppe in the tumor area of c6-inoculated animals was ± μg eb/g dry tissue, a value that did not differ from those observed in tumor-free animals inoculated with vehicle only, or inoculated with cell vehicle plus sar. injection of bk into c6-inoculated animals also did not change the tumor ppe. it is important to note that in all groups the left hemispheres presented ppe values similar to those of the right hemisphere in the control animals. however, sar significantly increased ppe in the tumor area of c6-inoculated animals. this effect was abolished, with a return to basal levels, by pre-treatment of the animals with the bk receptor b antagonist leu. the effect of sar in increasing ppe in c6-inoculated right hemispheres was also observed when compared to the contralateral non-tumoral hemisphere. discussion we demonstrate here that the selective b receptor agonist sar enhances ppe in c glioma without affecting the normal brain parenchyma. it has been previously shown that sar at nmol/kg also does not alter the systemic blood pressure of rats. the effect of sar was blocked by pre-treatment with the selective b receptor antagonist leu, suggesting that ppe can be modulated by b receptors in the glioma model of c6-inoculated rats. it was recently described that gliomas may express both b and b bk receptors, with b being located closer to the periphery of the tumor cells while b was observed throughout the cell. in view of their effects on vascular dilatation and blood flow, bradykinin receptor agonists have been tested in the chemotherapy of brain tumors, whereas bradykinin itself was less used for this purpose due to its lower efficacy and shorter blood half-life. in contrast to other authors we did not observe an effect of bk by itself in enhancing bbb or btb permeability. fast bk degradation could account for this difference since we used a femoral vein, whereas other authors used more proximal accesses like the carotid artery. the b receptor agonist rmp- has been successfully employed to enhance btb permeability to chemotherapeutic agents, but in the animal models already tested only local or regional routes like the carotid artery were used. in general, b receptors are non-constitutive and restricted to pathologic processes including tumors or degeneration. systemically administered metabolically resistant b receptor agonists may be useful to increase chemotherapy levels at the target site, with higher specificity and lower toxicity than b receptor agonists. thus, we believe that sar injected together with chemotherapeutic agents may be useful to increase drug delivery specifically to the brain tumor with less toxicity to non-affected areas. additionally, because eb circulates bound to albumin, it is reasonable to think that sar could increase the delivery of several chemotherapeutic agents of molecular weight similar to, or lower than that of albumin. although the evans blue method is less sensitive than other labeling methods like quantitative autoradiography, for example, we used it because it was the only method available to us at the time of this experiment. however, the evans-blue method is of low cost, can be easily reproduced by other laboratories, and was sensitive enough to detect differences provoked by sar in these experiments. bk or bk agonists have been previously used to increase btb permeability but, due to their faster enzymatic degradation, they were injected into the carotid artery. however, our findings suggest, that sar administered intravenously remains stable and thus could be an attractive agent for the treatment of brain or even other tumors that express bk b receptors.  our data suggest that the b receptor modulates ppe in the blood tumor barrier of c glioma. a possible role for the systemic use of sar in the chemotherapy of gliomas or other cns neoplasms deserves further study. "," while it is well known that bradykinin b agonists increase plasma protein extravasation in brain tumors, the bradykinin b agonists tested thus far are unable to produce this effect. here we examine the effect of the selective b agonist bradykinin sar-des-arg9bk, a compound resistant to enzymatic degradation with prolonged activity on ppe in the blood circulation in the c rat glioma model.  sar administration significantly enhanced ppe in c rat brain glioma compared to saline or bk. pre-administration of the bradykinin b antagonist -des-arg blocked the sar-induced ppe in the tumor area.  our data suggest that the b receptor modulates ppe in the blood tumor barrier of c glioma. a possible role for the use of sar in the chemotherapy of gliomas deserves further study.

49," there is considerable genomic variability among humans that is not associated with a recognizable clinical phenotype. this variability is evident at both the chromosomal level and at the single nucleotide level ). the gains and losses of sub-microscopic dna segments larger than kb are termed copy number variants. they represent a newly recognized class of dna variation, identified as a result of the introduction of comparative genomic hybridization array technology that enables the study of variation in the number of copies of specific dna segments among individuals. the widespread presence of cnvs in normal individuals has now been documented using not only array cgh-containing bac clones but also oligonucleotide arrays at high resolution as well snp data analysis and dna sequence comparisons between individuals. the discovery of cnvs presents investigators with a number of challenges as cnvs complicate the interpretation of array data and efforts to attribute microdeletions and microduplications identified in individuals with constitutional disorders or in cancerous tissues to the disease processes. the role of cnvs in causing or influencing the susceptibility to disease and genome evolution remains largely unknown. a catalogue of published cnvs can be found in the public database, and helps to guide the interpretation of array cgh findings. however, the number and identity of polymorphic loci detected in different studies varies considerably, likely because of differences across various array platforms, analytical methods and the populations investigated. in addition, copy number differences for many of the cnvs listed in the above database are not confirmed using secondary independent quantification methods. therefore, further work to identify and characterize cnvs in human populations and confirm copy number variability is essential in order to better understand the significance of cnvs and to determine their role in common disorders. we studied phenotypically normal individuals and detected different sub-microscopic cnvs using the mb resolution whole genome array-cgh. we used real-time quantitative pcr and fish to confirm cnvs. the results of these studies are presented.  array-cgh findings of cnvs in normal subjects by studying phenotypically normal, healthy individuals using commercial array-cgh, different cnvs were identified and further classified into subgroups. group a contains cnvs which were previously reported in the public database, either as an identical clone entry or as part of a reported genomic cnv region. the remaining cnvs in group b of table represent novel cnvs. in total, cnvs were observed in two or more individuals; the majority of recurrent cnvs belonged to group a. segmental duplications were found in cnvs. of the cnvs, only were found to contain genes listed in the omim database; 9/ genes were found in one cnv in group a. in addition to genes primarily involved in functions of the human immune or sensory systems, signal transduction and metabolism, genes involved in transcription regulation, neurotransmitter transport, cell proliferation and differentiation or development were also identified. note: * clone showing multiple sites based on e-fish. aa: african american; h: hispanic; c: caucasian. the three clones which showed copy number changes most frequently in our subjects were rp11-259n, rp11-100c and rp11-79f, and were found in and individuals respectively. fish and rt-qpcr analysis of polymorphic clones a) fish in order to establish the cellular copy number pattern of known and novel cnvs, we performed fish analysis of cnvs in subjects for whom a cell pellet was available. for some clones, copy number changes could be confirmed by fish, while for others the fish patterns were discordant with array-cgh results. for example, array analysis of clones rp5-1011o at 2q and rp11-89m at 8p both showed a deletion upon array analysis, and both were subsequently confirmed by fish. however, the fish signal pattern was different for these two clones: clone rp5-1011o had a complete loss of one copy, demonstrating a complete deletion while clone rp11-89m exhibited a diminished fish signal on one of the homologs suggestive of a partial deletion. c = confirmed nc = not confirmed nt = not tested conversely, fish analysis of clone rp11-100c showed consistent normal signal patterns in multiple subjects regardless of whether the clone was seen as a loss or gain on array analysis. gains of clones rp11-125a and rp11-270m could not be confirmed by fish. finally, gain of the clone rp11-598f was seen as multiple signals mapping to several chromosomes, demonstrating the presence of homologous sequences within this clone in several regions of the genome. this observation was also confirmed by the in silico efish simulation tool. b) rt-qpcr and fish comparisons rt-qpcr analysis was performed for 3/ clones tested by fish in order to confirm the array results and to help resolve the array and fish discrepancies. comparable results between fish and rt-qpcr were obtained for all clones tested by both methods – i.e. deletions of rp11-89m and pr5-1011o were confirmed by rt-qpcr and the lack of copy number change for rp11-100c as seen by fish was also noted by rt-qpcr. discussion our study of normal subjects revealed a total of cnvs: previously described cnvs and novel cnvs. a higher number of known than novel cnvs showed recurrence in the subjects tested. similarly, evidence of segmental duplications was found in 6/ previously described cnvs. this confirms the observation that recurring cnvs are more prevalent in the human population, and tend to be associated with segmental duplications, while our novel cnvs are possibly less frequent and individual specific. the number of cnvs detected in our controls is comparable to the number obtained by other investigators using the same commercial array-cgh and cut-off levels. however, the number is significantly smaller than that observed by iafrate et al who reported cnvs in individuals. although they used the same array-cgh platform, a different dynamic website-based analytical method was applied, instead of our fixed cut-off levels of for duplications and for deletions, suggesting that the analytical method used plays a significant role in the number of apparent cnvs detected among individuals. recently, a number of studies addressed the question of global genomic variation using different approaches including tiling bac array, snp polymorphisms and oligo arrays. the number of cnvs and chromosomal regions affected varied among studies even when the same array platform was used. for example, the bac tiling arrays detected autosomal segmental cnvs in controls, cnvs in controls and cnvs in individuals with intellectual disability and their phenotypically normal parents. the differences in the populations studied may have contributed to the observed discrepancies, however, even when the same individuals were examined using a different approach less than half of the cnvs were detected on both platforms. it is now evident that none of the existing technologies can capture all human variation. one of the pre-requisites for understanding global human variation is the confirmation of cnvs using alternative methods. their recurrence and presence as detected using different platforms supports that these are true differences among individuals. however, a large number of cnvs are still ""unique"", i.e. specific for a control subject/family or study. independent quantification methods such as fish or rt-qpcr should ideally be performed on many cnvs, particularly those appearing in one individual, as these are the most likely ones to be false positives. considering the large number of cnvs reported the number of validated cnvs using independent quantification methods such as rt-qpcr or fish is still proportionally very small due to the time consuming or limited throughput of single locus analysis. for example, in two recent larger studies reporting a total of > cnvs, less than cnvs were validated using quantification methods. using fish we have confirmed array-detected copy number changes of 3/ selected cnvs, while for 3/ cnvs a normal two signal fish pattern was seen. we tested two fish-confirmed cnvs using rt-qpcr, one partially and one fully deleted, and observed concordance between all methods. as two of the three fish non-confirmed cnvs are recognized as being very common and recurrent on multiple platforms, we further evaluated rp11-100c using rt-qpcr but failed to achieve confirmation of both gain and loss. it is possible that this cnv is composed of tightly packed repeats which can be discerned only by fiber fish, as noted for clone rp11-259n from chromosome. additional cause of the array-cgh vs. fish/rt-qpcr discrepancy may be due to the fact that array-cgh assays evaluate the relative ratio of segmental dna copy number in the test dna vs. reference dna, and do not provide an absolute number of copies, as explained in figure the information on new cnvs is expanding dramatically, and cataloguing clones for which independent quantification is performed are desirable, as only detailed analysis of a large number of cnvs will help better understand their basic structure, dna content and reasons for variability. currently, the significance of cnvs remains puzzling, as many of these genomic regions contain genes and coding sequences associated with known genetic disorders. in our subjects 13/ different cnvs were associated with omim genes; the number was usually not higher than genes/cnv, except for cnv rp11-144o which had genes involved in sensory perception, cell adhesion-mediated signaling, immune and defense processes. this clone was noted in one of our hispanic individuals and was reported as one of the more divergent clones in the populations reported by redon et al. many of the genes in cnvs are described as ""environmental sensor genes"" and are associated with mechanisms mediating immune responsiveness, cellular metabolism, and membrane surface interactions. it is now established that the copy number variability of some genes can influence susceptibility to some diseases. for example, it has been reported that people with fewer copy numbers of ccl3l a gene involved in immunity, are more susceptible to hiv infection. the extent of associations of cnvs with disease susceptibility will become clearer as we learn more about the distribution of well characterized cnvs in individuals whose health and medical histories are fully evaluated.  submicroscopic cnvs are a common form of human genomic variation, which can be readily identified by array-cgh technology in phenotypically normal individuals. the number of cnvs detected in each study is influenced by several factors, especially the array platform and method of analysis. our results confirm the wide distribution of cnvs in three different ethnic populations and expand the number of recognized cnvs. cataloguing of confirmed cnvs, quantified using independent methods, would facilitate their interpretation and understanding of their significance in the future. "," genomic copy number variants involving > kb of dna have recently been found to be widely distributed throughout the human genome. they represent a newly recognized form of dna variation in normal populations, discovered through screening of the human genome using high-throughput and high resolution methods such as array comparative genomic hybridization. in order to understand their potential significance and to facilitate interpretation of array-cgh findings in constitutional disorders and cancers, we studied normal individuals using commercially available mb resolution bac array. a selection of cnvs was further analyzed by fish and real-time quantitative pcr.  a total of different cnvs were detected in normal subjects. sixteen were not previously reported. thirteen of the cnvs contained genes listed in omim. fish analysis of cnvs in normal subjects resulted in the confirmation of copy number changes for of novel cnvs and of known cnvs. three cnvs tested by fish were further validated by rt-qpcr and comparable data were obtained. this included the lack of copy number change by both rt-qpcr and fish for clone rp11-100c one of the most common known copy number variants, as well as confirmation of deletions for clones rp11-89m and rp5-1011o  we have described novel cnvs in individuals. further study of a small selection of cnvs indicated concordant and discordant array vs. fish/rt-qpcr results. although a large number of cnvs has been reported to date, quantification using independent methods and detailed cellular and/or molecular assessment has been performed on a very small number of cnvs. this information is, however, very much needed as it is currently common practice to consider cnvs reported in normal subjects as benign changes when detected in individuals affected with a variety of developmental disorders.

50," chaperones assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins. in the e. coli cytosol, the folding of newly synthesized proteins is assisted by the ribosome-associated trigger factor, the dnak system, and the groel system. kje and els also prevent aggregation and promote refolding of preexisting proteins which lost their native conformation e.g. due to thermal denaturation or intrinsic instability. kje furthermore cooperates with clpb to solubilize aggregated proteins and refold them to the native state in a concerted action with els. moreover, the small heat shock proteins of e. coli, ibpa and ibpb, intercalate into protein aggregates and thereby facilitate the kje/clpb dependent disaggregation and refolding. the overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. folding problems of overproduced client proteins can be caused by limitations in the chaperone capacity of the host cells. several attempts were made to increase the yields of correctly folded, and hence soluble, recombinant proteins by the co-overproduction of individual chaperones in producing cells, however only with a limited success. for example, the co-overproduction of els increases the solubility of human orp human lysozyme, p50csk protein tyrosine kinase, phosphomannose isomerase and fusion protein pres2-s'-β-galactosidase and maize protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase. the co-overproduction of kje increases the solubility of endostatin, human orp transglutaminase and pres2-s'-β-galactosidase. to assess the full potential of the cellular network of molecular chaperones for the production of soluble recombinant proteins we performed a systematic analysis of the combined power of the major cytosolic chaperone systems of e. coli, kje, els, clpb and ibpab. we did not include trigger factor in our analyses since it acts through a 1: association with ribosomes and is already present in three-fold molar excess over ribosomes in wild type cells.  we first investigated a combination of the two major chaperone systems with folding activity, kje and els, and the co-operating chaperone with disaggregating activity, clpb. to allow for regulated overproduction of chaperones we generated a set of compatible plasmids, which differ in copy number, express chaperone genes under control of a strong or weaker promoter combined with the laco operator, and encode the laciq repressor gene. this set of plasmids was designed to allow for iptg-inducible expression of chaperone genes in different combinations, and to produce chaperones at the stoichiometries, which are optimal for their folding activity. host cell were transformed with plasmids in combinations. combination for overproduction of kje; combination for overproduction of kje and clpb; combination for overproduction of els; combination for overproduction of kje, clpb and high amounts of els; combination for overproduction of kje with clpb and lower amounts of els. continuous growth of these cells in medium containing μm iptg resulted in an increase of dnak, clpb, groel over wild type levels, without causing apparent growth defects. host cells containing different combinations of these plasmids were subsequently transformed with plasmids expressing different recombinant genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin from iptg-controlled promoters. the encoded proteins include monomers and oligomers, cytosolic, membrane bound and secreted proteins, full-length, fragmented and fused proteins, with molecular weights ranging between and kda. proteins were hexa-histidine tagged to allow affinity purification of the soluble fractions. of the target proteins tested showed an increase in the final yield of purified, soluble protein upon co-overproduction of chaperones. of these proteins, showed a - to -fold increase in solubility, and proteins became soluble only upon chaperone co-overproduction, allowing its purification under native conditions. for of the target proteins the highest increase in solubility was achieved by co-overproduction of all three kje, els and clpb chaperone systems in combination or with a higher success rate for combination which produces higher levels of els. for of the proteins the highest increase in solubility was obtained with combination which overproduces els alone, and in only one case each the combination or yielded the highest degree of solubility of the substrate protein. taken together, these results show that chaperone co-overproduction is successful in about 50% of the proteins tested, with kje, clpb and els being the most successful combination. we did not observe any influence of the protein fusion tags, which have been fused to some of the recombinant proteins, on the efficiency of chaperone mediated solubility increase. furthermore, identical beneficial effects of chaperone co-production were observed when selected recombinant proteins were produced in larger culture volumes with final yields in the range of 2– mg/l. we tested for several recombinant proteins whether their solubility reflects the folding to the native state. tev protease purified from the soluble fractions of cells with and without co-overproduction of els was active in cleaving a gst-tep domain fusion protein and showed highly similar circular dichroism spectra. for the target protein e8r the soluble material purified from cells without chaperone co-overproduction showed co-purification of significant amounts of el, in contrast to the e8r protein purified from els/kje/clpb overproducing cells which appears el-free, indicative of correct folding. these results suggest that the overproduction of chaperones not only results in improved solubility of the recombinant proteins tested but also enhances the acquisition of the native state. the increase in solubility of target proteins relative to control cells without co-overexpression of chaperones is given in the column ""yield increase"". the chaperone combinations for optimal yield of each target protein in the one-step and two-step procedures are indicated. proteins that exhibited solubility exclusively after chaperone co-overexpression are indicated by ""∞"". the symbol ""*"" indicates that no soluble protein was purified from cells with or without chaperone co-overproduction. n.d., not determined. the same protein name can appear more than one time in the list because different constructs have been used for its expression. to further improve the solubility of recombinant proteins we considered that it may be of advantage to allow chaperone-assisted folding in the absence of ongoing protein biosynthesis, thereby preventing the continuous generation of novel aggregation-prone proteins. in one set of experiments we prevented further synthesis of the plasmid-encoded target and chaperone proteins by withdrawal of iptg. in another set of experiments synthesis of all cellular proteins was blocked by the addition of chloramphenicol to the culture medium after removal of iptg. in out of tested recombinant proteins the two-step procedure resulted in higher solubility yields as compared to the one-step procedure. out of these, two proteins required the two-step procedure for any solubilization, and six proteins showed a chaperone-mediated solubilization only with the two-step procedure. for of the proteins the chaperone combinations or resulted in the highest yields of soluble recombinant protein. the two-step procedure thus is clearly superior over the one-step procedure in the production of soluble recombinant protein. as an example fig. 4a shows the data obtained for btke, a domain of the brutons tyrosine kinase from human, applied to all chaperone combinations. even in control cells lacking chaperone expression plasmids, the two-step procedure resulted in a slight increase in btke solubility as compared to the one-step procedure. this is in agreement with the previous observation that in wild type cells, the recovery of soluble recombinant proteins from aggregates can be improved by inhibition of protein biosynthesis. the total amount of btke produced under chaperone-coexpressing conditions was similar for all strains tested. the one-step procedure resulted in an increased solubility of btke only for chaperone combinations and in contrast, the two-step procedure, with a two-hour folding period in the presence of chloramphenicol, resulted in increased solubility for all five chaperone combinations, as compared to the control without chaperone co-overproduction. the most striking case was chaperone combination in which the solubility of btke, as compared to the control cells without chaperone co-overproduction, was 42-fold higher for the two-step procedure; in contrast, the one-step procedure yields only a 7-fold increase. interestingly, the optimal chaperone combination differs between the one-step procedure and the two-step procedure. this switch in chaperone utilization probably reflects the fact that during the folding period in step aggregated btke is solubilized in a process that requires the concerted action of kje and clpb. several parameters were found to affect the solubilization efficiency. a two hour incubation of the cells in chloramphenicol containing media at 20°c was optimal for high yields of soluble btke. longer incubation times or higher temperature lowered the yield, probably because btke is not entirely stable and is degraded in vivo as indicated by the decreased total amounts of btke found in these cells. furthermore, significant solubility of btke could be achieved when transcription of the target gene was decreased by the removal of the inducer iptg during the folding period, instead of inhibiting protein biosynthesis by chloramphenicol. although the chaperone combinations described so far showed remarkable effects on the solubility of out of recombinant proteins we aimed at a further optimization of the procedure. recent findings indicate that the activity of clpb in disaggregation and refolding of heat denatured proteins is facilitated by the presence of the bacterial shsps, ibpa and ibpb. we tested the effects of co-expression of the ibpab genes either alone, or with els or els, kje, clpb. the co-overproduction of ibpab resulted in significant further improvement of the solubility of recombinant proteins. remarkably, ibpab co-overproduction was beneficial even for some of the proteins, which remained completely insoluble with any of the previously tested chaperone combinations. fig. 4a shows two examples of such previously insoluble proteins. out of the proteins tested, the co-overproduction of ibpab resulted in an increased solubility of proteins in the one-step procedure. using the two-step procedure the yields of additional soluble proteins was increased. in sum, out of proteins tested showed increased solubility, and in cases the chaperone co-expression was the only possibility to obtain any soluble protein. increases in the amount of purified, soluble protein are given relative to the optimal solubility obtained either by the best of the combinations to tested before or to control cells. symbols as in table  taking all results together, the co-overproduction of the entire network of major cytosolic chaperones in e. coli cells, combined with a two-step procedure that allows for folding of the recombinant proteins in the absence of ongoing de novo synthesis, resulted in an increased solubility of 70% of the recombinant proteins tested. this efficiency is remarkable as most of the constructs used in this study encode proteins that are difficult to be produced in soluble form. the engineered e. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here should prove particularly useful for biotechnological applications. "," the overproduction of recombinant proteins in host cells often leads to their misfolding and aggregation. previous attempts to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. we now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the e. coli cytosol on the solubility of recombinant proteins.  a two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. in a first step, the four chaperone systems groel/groes, dnak/dnaj/grpe, clpb and the small hsps ibpa/ibpb, were coordinately co-overproduced with recombinant proteins to optimize de novo folding. in a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. this novel strategy increased the solubility of 70% of different heterologous proteins tested up to 42-fold.  the engineered e. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various recombinant proteins and should be applicable to a wide range of target proteins produced in biotechnology.

51," specific protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interaction are in the focus of many biochemical studies. the exact nature of these interactions is not known. some scientists argue that the macromolecular interactions are determined by long sequence domains that are involving many residues, while others found that there is some degree of specificity already on a single residue level, i. e. some residue pairs are preferentially co-located on interacting interfaces. the existence of preferred residue pairs within, as well as between, macro-molecular structures are supported by numerous statistical analyses of protein-rna regulatory protein-dna, restrictions enzyme-dna cut site, protein-protein structures and interfaces. although many studies are performed for statistical analyses of residue co-location, it was not possible for us to find a publicly available tool for this purpose. we found only a reference for the existence of a commercially available tool, the quanta modeling software. implementation any structure files may be selected for analyses from the main window.. the tool automatically provide the title of the selected pdb file, a list of sequences present in the file and a list of every common atom in the residues of the respective sequences. these possible backbone atoms are n, ca: calpha, c and o in proteins; and p, o1p: o1p, o2p: o2p, o5*: o5', c5*: c5', c4*: c4', o4*: o4'. c3*: c3', o3*: o3', c2*: c2', c1*: c1', c5: c c6: c n1: n c2: c, n3: n and c4: c in nucleic acids. it is possible to exclude one or more sequence from analyses by selecting the ""no-one"" option in the common atoms list. the user is asked to define a spherical space around the selected core atoms by choosing a minimum and maximum detection radius around these atoms. it is usually not interesting to detect residue co-locations related to neighbor residues in the same sequences. therefore it is possible to exclude up- and downstream neighbors in the same sequence.. the program ignores terminal residues if they are annotated as hetatm i.e. non-standard residues. the seqx program makes a list of atoms which are located within the defined radius around the pre-selected common atoms and are not excluded as neighbor residues. this list is accessible as a residue table that contains the residue contact map elements. the atomic distances are calculated by the pythagoras theses. the results of these analyses are visualized in a residue contact map and summarized in a statistical table. the residue contact map is a dot-plot like graph where every residue in every sequence in the pdb structure is compared to each other, and residue co-locations are indicated by a square. the color of the squares indicate the type of molecular contacts. the main features of the protein secondary structure are indicated by background colors, if they are annotated in the pdb source files. it is possible to zoom in the center of the map and move it into optional directions. primary structure is available along the coordinates. if the sequence is too long, it is necessary to zoom in the map to make the sequence readable.. protein sequence is indicated with the one-letter codes, while the nucleic acid sequence with the a, t/u, g, c letters. clicking on any co-locations highlights the corresponding letters in the sequences. a simple statistical analysis is performed and the number of every possible residue combinations is listed in a residue contact table. it is possible to save the results of the analysis in jpg and xls files. it is also possible to save even the residue contact map in binary form and xls format for future statistical processing.  the residue contact map provides a 2d dot-plot like graph of residue co-locations in protein, nucleic acid or nucleoprotein complexes.. this plot is simple and as easy to understand as any other dot-plot. the main right diagonal line corresponds to residue co-locations in the same polymeric chain and it is possible to eliminate by neighbor exclusion.. the residue contact table contains all possible residue combinations and lists the frequency of theses co-locations in the observed structure. some of the listed co-locations are specific while other is aspecific co-locations. it is possible to estimate the specificity of the results only in the case of nucleic acids where the watson-crick base pairs are known to be specific co-locations. the residue contact table provides data for the different type of nucleic acid base co-locations, however it is known that only adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine co-locations indicate true and specific base-pairs, while the other pairs are false. the estimated specificity of the seqx tool on dsdna is up to 60%,. the specificity is greatly improved by proper distance selection and exclusion of residue neighbors.. it is easy to explain the reason for these observations.. it is more difficult to find optimal seqx parameters for studying residue co-locations in- and between proteins. in contrast to the dna it is not known which amino acid pairs represent specific residue co-locations. furthermore some protein structures are very compact and, for example, in the case of alpha helical proteins many amino acid neighbors might interfere with the specificity of the detection and the exclusion of more than one neighbor is necessary to improve the specificity of the detection. we found that detection radius between 5– Å and exclusion of +/- neighbors gives the best results for analyzing alpha helical protein structures. a real specificity estimation is not possible to do on protein sequences, because the amino acids are not known to be complementary to each other. therefore the frequency of amino acid co-locations found by seqx is compared to the frequency of residue co-locations data from literature. our results showed highly significant correlation to data from the literature.. some cautious and preliminary estimation is still possible even for the specificity of detected residue co-locations in protein structures. namely, it is known from physico-chemical studies, that some amino acids are attractive while others are repulsive to each other. the known physico-chemical laws suggest that pair-formation is probably preferred between amino acids having similar hydrophobicity or different charge, while pair-building between amino acids with different hydrophobicity or similar charge are strongly prohibited. to test this assumption we generated a pool of artificial random protein sequences by translating randomized nucleic acid sequences. the nucleic acids contained equal amount of each nucleotide bases and, by that way, the average frequency of amino acids in the translated artificial proteins became very similar to the amino acid frequency of the entire human proteome. the residue co-locations within and between these sequences are determined by statistical lows if we assume that the spatial mobility of the residues in these proteins is free and independent of each other. the calculated probability of any residue co-locations will be pab = nanb/t t = na+nb...+n wher n is the number of a given amino acid. the calculated relative frequency of a given co-locating pair is proportional to pab and might be calculated by the cab = pab/ formula, where x and y indicate any of the possible amino acids and the number of xy pairs is the relative frequency of physico-chemically favored co-locations is significantly higher in real protein structures than it is calculated for random interactions. this example indicates that the number of false positive co-locations is about 20% and the specificity of seqx methods for proteins might be as much as ~80% however this is a very crude estimate, because the number of true co-locations is not surely known. discussion to understand the nature of specificity of macromolecular interactions is a major challenge in bioinformatics. we were successful in providing evidence to support the view that some degree of specificity already exists on residue level. therefore we decided to continue our studies of frequency analyses of residue co-locations in nucleoprotein structures. the seqx tool is specifically designed for this purpose. the 2d residue contact map is a simple and easy to understand display of nucleic acid and protein structures. there are some very sophisticated analytical tools which also even incorporate this feature, like moltalk, sting millennium, stride molsurfer molprobity. the major advantage of this approach is its simplicity. the effective usage of 3d tools and learning the ""3d thinking"" usually requires lengthy training which often is not affordable for general bioinformaticians. we have further developed the concept of residue contact map and added many new features that are not present in existing tools. such features are, the option to choose different backbone atoms for statistical analyzes and visualization of entire-residue co-locations and it does not pay particular attention to side chains and the pattern of the side chain interactions. it does not limit the usefulness of this tool for its original purpose: any significant residue co-locations are necessarily caused by the side chains because they are the variable elements of the structures. however a future implementation might focus on analyzes of side chain to side chain co-locations and examine whether that will improve the specificity of this tool.  the seqx is a simple, easy to use specialized tool for visualization and statistical analyses of protein and nucleic acid residue co-locations. it is mainly and specifically developed to study known and novel specific residue interactions. authors' contributions jcb designed and tested the tool, and wrote this article. gf implemented the software. gf is the winner of the first prize of the first hungarian george gamow

52," as the use of next-generation sequencing technologies for studying human disease continues to grow, defects in the cancer genome and their association with disease progression and treatment options are being reported at an astonishing rate. single nucleotide variants, one of the most prevalent mutation types, often occur in cancer related genes and can result in amino acid changes and nonfunctional proteins. accurate prediction of any possible downstream consequences to the amino acid residue is one critical analytical requirement for any robust ngs pipeline. without accurate variant annotation, further exploitation of the ngs data in both research and clinical contexts can be compromised. it has been observed that certain cancers present a signature pattern of mnvs where substitution mutations occur at consecutive bases. this phenomenon may reflect pathological history such as tobacco usage or ultraviolet light exposure. although mnvs can be identified by common variant callers, development of corresponding annotation tools has been lagging behind. most existing variant callers report a mnv as individual snvs. as a result, the predicted amino acid change is likely incorrect when a mnv occurs at multiple bases within the same protein codon. existing annotators can predict the amino acid change for mnvs, but must rely on user-provided, mostly manually curated, mnv data sources. for mutations automatically called by snv-based pipelines, there is a pressing need for automated tools to identify and fix any incorrectly annotated mnvs.fig. amino acid predictions for two neighboring snvs scenarios. two consecutive snvs in gene tp codon the fact the two snvs are present on the same read suggests they are originated from the same chromosome. incorrect annotation based on prediction of individual snvs. the first and second snvs were predicted to introduce e285v and e285q, respectively. the correct amino acid change based on mnv is e285l. two snvs are located in gene or6y codon but on different reads, suggesting they originated from separate chromosomes. the two snvs in b were correctly predicted to introduce v252v and v252i based on individual snvs. the sequencing reads are displayed in igv viewer the challenge in distinguishing a mnv from neighboring snvs from separate chromosomes resides in haplotype phasing and the ability to determine the combination of alleles found on the same chromosome. retrieving haplotype information from ngs reads is not entirely new, but most published methods specialize in germline polymorphisms and typically rely on population genetics information. to date there has been no published program to identify mnvs from existing snv calls and to restore incorrectly predicted amino acids. here we present mac, a software designed to automatically correct mnv annotation generated from any existing snv-based variant pipeline. by processing a list of previously detected snvs and the corresponding raw data in sequence alignment/map format, mac builds a multigraph containing snvs with haplotype phase and codon information to identify connected components defined as a block of mutation within codon, a structural unit containing a potentially mis-annotated amino acid. for every bmc, mac further extracts every existing haplotype and annotates it using a user-specified variant annotator. for convenience, we have precompiled mac to work with three popular annotators: annovar, snpeff and vep. to be flexible with other annotators, mac also provides a ‘no-annotation’ mode. under this mode, mac will output raw haplotype phase information which can be used as the input for any user preferred annotation tool. the accessibility of this tool, together with its flexibility and robustness, should facilitate accurate annotation of these infrequently occurring but potentially significant variant subtypes. implementation mac is implemented in perl and can be run on any linux/unix-like environment with installation of perl and bio-samtools package. an overview of the mac pipeline is provided below. input mac requires a list of previously called snvs and the corresponding bam file. to be flexible with all existing pipelines, the snv list can be generated from any caller and only basic information is required: mutan/mutant alleles. selection of the annotator by the user the overall process of correcting mnv annotations occurs as two steps: 1) haplotype phasing, and 2) determining the protein codon. mac can be run with either ‘no-annotation’ mode or one of three pre-compiled genetic variant annotating tools. mac will output explicit haplotype phasing information either way so that users have full flexibility in annotator selection. if the ‘no-annotation’ mode is specified, mac will output any identified bms by reporting haplotype phase information and the corresponding read counts. the user can then select their own annotating tool to annotate each haplotype, and fix any co-located snvs with overlapping codons. if the user chooses to use one of the three pre-compiled annotators, mac will incorporate the codon information with the haplotype phase to identify snvs with overlapping codons within each bm. therefore, our motivation for not using a simple codon-based screening approach is to provide explicit haplotype phasing information so that the users have more flexibility in annotator selection. output the report of mac is based on the identified bmcs. each bmc may contain multiple haplotypes and each row corresponds to one haplotype in a certain bmc. the following columns are included: 1) bmc id consisting of all snvs in the bmc; 2) an index number of the haplotype in current bmc; 3) the status of each snv in the current haplotype: mutant, non-mutant, or unknown; 4) the number of unique ngs reads supporting current haplotype; 5) corrected annotation including gene, mrna transcript and amino acid change for any haplotype containing at least one snvs.  to evaluate the mac software, a test data set containing somatic snvs detected by whole genome sequencing in breast cancer specimens was used. after initial sequencing read extraction and grouping, block of mutations were identified containing total snvs. the sizes of the bms, in terms of the numbers of snvs, range from snvs, snvs, snvs to snvs. upon manual review, the bm with snvs is located near a structural variation and appears to fit the previously described phenomenon of “kataegis”, a pattern of confined hypermutation co-localized with structural variations in cancer. a total of bmcs were identified after selecting for snvs with overlapping codons. all bmcs are dinucleotide variations, and a mini bam file containing all these bmcs is available in the mac package. a detailed comparison for the identified dinucleotide variations shows that the mnv-based amino acid change prediction is different from the amino acid change predicted in the snv-based set. specifically, of the snvs were predicted to cause different amino acid change after re-annotation. in one particular case of znf a missense mnv was annotated as nonsense in the previous snv-based annotation.fig. depiction of mac workflow and a mac test run. left: a list of snvs identified by any variant caller; reads extracted from the bam file for all snvs to identify block of mutations; identify block of mutations within codon within each subgraph using an annotation tool. right: mac test run using input snvs from a breast cancer data set identified bms and bmcs containing

annotations one of these identified mnvs resides in the tumor suppressor gene tp the two snvs occur at consecutive base pairs, both in codon glutamic acid in tp. the first snv was predicted to replace glutamic acid by valine, while the second snv was predicted as a change to glutamine. however, neither of these two predictions was correct because these two mutations are co-located on the same chromosome. the actual amino acid product, after translating the two snvs simultaneously, is leucine. therefore, to accurately assess the functional change of this tp mutation and others, it is important to determine the exact haplotype prior to annotating the amino acid change.  we developed mac, a program to support users of snv-based callers to restore potentially incorrect amino acid change predictions by mnvs. the current approach employed by most ngs variant pipelines, i.e. treating a mnv as unrelated snvs and annotating each variant separately, often leads to inaccurate results. despite the overall low prevalence in most cancers, mnvs can happen at much higher frequency in certain cancer types. accurate mnv annotation is especially important for correctly understanding the tumorigenic mechanisms in such cancers. correcting these annotation errors requires haplotype phase information, which is not retained by most variant callers. our program mac solves the problem by retrieving the haplotype phase information from the bam file, identifying and fixing any potentially mis-annotated protein codons. as the amount of sequencing data grows rapidly, this automated pipeline provides a convenient solution to bridge the gap between the commonly used snv-based variant callers and the need for correct mnv annotation. although the development of mac was motivated by more frequently observed dinucleotide substitutions, mac can also provide annotation correction for trinucleotide or other complex substitution mutations. we foresee a variety of extensions to the applications of mac. in addition to known cancer types with a high frequency of mnvs, mac can provide accurate annotation for any genomic locations involving multiple haplotypes such as mutation hot spots. when running under the ‘no-annotation’ mode, mac can also provide haplotype phase information for neighboring snvs. this function can be useful in determining biallelic mutant status or characterizing tumor heterogeneity. "," next-generation sequencing technologies have rapidly advanced our understanding of human variation in cancer. to accurately translate the raw sequencing data into practical knowledge, annotation tools, algorithms and pipelines must be developed that keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology. currently, a challenge exists in accurately annotating multi-nucleotide variants. these tandem substitutions, when affecting multiple nucleotides within a single protein codon of a gene, result in a translated amino acid involving all nucleotides in that codon. most existing variant callers report a mnv as individual single-nucleotide variants, often resulting in multiple triplet codon sequences and incorrect amino acid predictions. to correct potentially misannotated mnvs among reported snvs, a primary challenge resides in haplotype phasing which is to determine whether the neighboring snvs are co-located on the same chromosome.  here we describe mac, an integrative pipeline developed to correct potentially mis-annotated mnvs. mac was designed as an application that only requires a snv file and the matching bam file as data inputs. using an example data set containing snvs and the corresponding whole-genome sequencing bam files, we show that mac identified eight potentially mis-annotated snvs, and accurately updated the amino acid predictions for seven of the variant calls.  mac can identify and correct amino acid predictions that result from mnvs affecting multiple nucleotides within a single protein codon, which cannot be handled by most existing snv-based variant pipelines. the mac software is freely available and represents a useful tool for the accurate translation of genomic sequence to protein function. issue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",629a3759-fe61-426d-9b59-e5bce6383318,pubmed
53," understanding the causes of rate variation in protein evolution is central for many fields including molecular evolution, comparative genomics and structural biology. a widely accepted principle is that more important proteins evolve more slowly. however, evolutionary rate variation not only exists between different proteins, but also between lineages. this was already observed in the earliest comparative studies, both within and across animal phyla. following the initial observation that drosophilids are fast evolving, it was shown that the rate of synonymous substitutions in drosophila melanogaster is approximately two times higher than in rodents and ten times higher than in primates. however, the estimated acceleration seemed to depend on the types of proteins examined, with another study reporting only a 3-fold difference between drosophila and mammalian rates. a study of the relative rates of ribosomal rna evolution in insect lineages showed that there was an episodic substitution rate increase of about 20-fold in the stem lineage of dipterans, suggesting that high evolutionary rates may be characteristic of the whole dipteran order. however, it is currently unclear whether the observed rate accelerations encompassed the whole nuclear genome, or whether they were restricted to certain classes of genes. in this study, we assess the genome-wide variation of evolutionary rates between insect lineages, by comparing the beetle tribolium castaneum, and the dipterans drosophila melanogaster and anopheles gambiae. we test whether there is an acceleration of protein evolution in dipterans that is observable on a genome-wide scale, whether this acceleration is confined to an episodic burst of changes at the base of the dipteran lineage, and whether this acceleration affects all genes to a similar extent.  genomic rate estimates confirm an acceleration in dipterans to estimate genomic evolutionary rates of insect lineages, we formed protein clusters derived from cdna or est data from beetle, fly, mosquito, aphid, and human. concatenation of these orthologous sequences resulted in a single, well-defined alignment of amino acids. given the known tree topology in figure, branch lengths were estimated using a maximum likelihood method. the dipteran branches are much longer than the tribolium branch, indicating accelerated evolution in the diptera. since their last common ancestor, drosophila has accumulated 36% more amino acid substitutions compared to tribolium, while the corresponding increase for anopheles compared to tribolium is 23%. a age of geological stage as defined in ""a geologic time scale"". b relative rate = rate/ in order to assign absolute rates of evolution, we combined the sequence distances in figure with absolute dates obtained from palaeontological estimates. based on the oldest coleopteran fossil and the timing of the primary radiation of holometabolous insect orders, the divergence of dipterans from coleopterans has been estimated to the early permian. the divergence between the brachycera and the nematocera lineages has been estimated to the middle permian. combining these dates with the maximum-likelihood estimates of branch lengths, we obtained the absolute evolutionary rates listed in table this shows that the my time interval starting with the separation of coleopterans and dipterans and culminating in the radiation of diptera was characterised by an episodic increase of evolutionary rate, averaging times the mean rate found for the tribolium lineage. deviations from clock-like evolution the accuracy of absolute rate estimates depends on the completeness of the known fossil record. thus, the uncertainty assigned to the dates in table which reflects the uncertainty in the dating of the strata where fossils were found, is an underestimate of the true uncertainty. to confirm that the dipteran rate acceleration is not an artefact of erroneous palaeontological estimates, we performed additional analyses that directly compared relative evolutionary rates. to this end, we implemented several models involving global or local molecular clocks. because these models are nested, they can be compared via likelihood-ratio tests. considering the branch length differences in table it is not surprising that the model employed above fits the data much better than a model with a global clock, which enforces a constant rate of evolution across all lineages. is the clock assumption violated only at specific branches? table assigns the strongest rate acceleration to the base of the diptera. however, an evolutionary model involving a local clock for this branch still fits the data significantly worse than the model without a clock; the same is indeed true for all models involving a single local clock. thus, a burst of accelerated evolution at the base of the dipterans is not sufficient to explain the rate increase found for dipterans as a whole. a lnc is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the model without a molecular clock. b df = degrees of freedom further comparison of increasingly complex models of evolution show that only models involving separate local clocks for the tribolium and drosophila lineages can fit the data as good as the model without a clock assumption. all other combinations of local clocks between the tribolium, drosophila and anopheles lineages were found to be inferior to the model without the clock. thus, although the accelerated evolution of dipterans was most pronounced during a burst of changes that occurred at the base of the order, a sustained increase is also detected in the branches separating drosophila from anopheles. remarkably, the need for a coleopteran local clock also demonstrates that the tribolium lineage has generally evolved much slower than most of the other taxa considered here. it should be noted that table contains multiple statistical comparisons, thereby decreasing the overall specificity of the statistical test. a conservative strategy to control for this is to divide the p-value cutoff for significance by the number of comparisons, i.e., to use p = / =, or – if accounting for all comparisons in data not shown – p = / =. this correction does not affect our conclusions. the dipteran acceleration affects the majority of individual genes by analysing concatenated amino acid sequences, we have demonstrated accelerated evolution in dipterans, compared to a slower rate in the tribolium lineage. is this rate change confined to certain genes, or does it extend across the genome as a whole? to analyse this issue, we calculated branch lengths for orthologous groups comprising sequences from tribolium and drosophila, using human as an outgroup. in figure we compare the amino acid distances of tribolium and drosophila proteins to their last common ancestor. there is a very strong relationship between these a priori unrelated distances. when calculated from single gene distances, the mean evolutionary rate of the drosophila lineage is significantly larger than the one of the tribolium lineage. the corresponding constant of proportionality is, in close agreement with the relative rate increase of obtained from the concatenated sequences. thus, although evolutionary rates among genes of a genome can vary by several orders of magnitude, these rates are nevertheless correlated between species even after more than my of independent evolution. discussion using nuclear transcripts, we find that the dipteran lineage has experienced an episodic increase in evolutionary rate when compared to the coleopteran lineage. this rate subsequently dropped in the diversifying dipteran lineage, but remained above average in drosophila. this is consistent with previous findings from studies of ribosomal rnas. the rate increases found in our genome-scale analysis of protein sequences are lower than those reported for rrnas, with an average increase of only -fold during dipteran evolution versus an at least threefold average increase for rrnas. however, our analysis is necessarily biased towards parts of genes that are sufficiently conserved to be detected in the outgroup and that could be unequivocally aligned. still, figure demonstrates that the averaged rate increase is representative for a large range of genes. the neutral theory of evolution predicts that the accumulation of molecular changes is only driven by the mutation rate and the degree of purifying selection. accordingly, genome-wide variation in the rate of protein evolution between species might be caused by physiological and ecological factors that affect the mutation rate, or by differences in the efficiency of selection. in the case of the rrna comparisons, we could indeed show that there has been a mutational bias towards incorporating more a/t nucleotides than g/c nucleotides at the base of the diptera, which has probably caused the episodic acceleration of evolutionary rates. such a mutational bias is likely to have affected the whole genome. however, the gc content of the tribolium genes in this study is very close to that of the drosophila orthologs, suggesting that mutational biases are unlikely to be responsible for the continued acceleration in dipterans. this interpretation is supported by the fact that it is the tribolium proteins which show a slight bias towards at-rich amino acids when compared to the drosophila orthologs. we observe a strong correlation between evolutionary rates in the tribolium and the drosophila lineages. this indicates that the selective forces acting on the majority of these genes have been similar between the two lineages, consistent with a neutral model. the correlation would be expected to become weaker or even disappear if positive selection would occur episodically among these genes. our finding that most proteins diverge in a clock-like fashion, with clock speeds that differ among lineages only due to genome-wide effects, suggests that episodic changes are an exception, although such changes are known to occur in some cases. however, we note that the class of fast evolving genes could not be analysed here, as they diverge too fast to allow identification as orthologs in distant comparisons. in a dedicated study of such genes between closely related drosophila lineages, we found that there are indeed a significant number of genes that must have undergone episodic changes in substitution rates on a gene by gene basis. thus, we emphasize that the above conclusions relate only to relatively conserved genes, while the generalized evolutionary patterns of fast evolving genes will need further study.  we reported here the analysis of evolutionary rate variation of a large number of orthologous genes between insect lineages. variation in the rate of evolution has genome-wide effects, and is correlated between orthologous genes over very long evolutionary time scales. because drosophila melanogaster is among the best studied animal model organisms, the peculiar evolutionary pattern confirmed here has practical implications. in blast searches of human sequences against tribolium and drosophila, tribolium sequences are found in 70% of cases to be more similar to human than drosophila genes. thus, when attempting to link human genes to their drosophila homologs, data from tribolium will be helpful to provide a more conservative reference sequence. this approach has been used, e.g., to resolve the evolutionary relationship between the drosophila zen gene and human hox genes. the slowly evolving beetle tribolium castaneum is thus likely to play a significant role for comparisons between phyla. "," the rate of molecular evolution varies widely between proteins, both within and among lineages. to what extent is this variation influenced by genome-wide, lineage-specific effects? to answer this question, we assess the rate variation between insect lineages for a large number of orthologous genes.  when compared to the beetle tribolium castaneum, we find that the stem lineage of flies and mosquitoes has experienced on average a 3-fold increase in the rate of evolution. pairwise gene comparisons between drosophila and tribolium show a high correlation between evolutionary rates of orthologous proteins.  gene specific divergence rates remain roughly constant over long evolutionary times, modulated by genome-wide, lineage-specific effects. among the insects analysed so far, it appears that the tribolium genes show the lowest rates of divergence. this has the practical consequence that homology searches for human genes yield significantly better matches in tribolium than in drosophila. we therefore suggest that tribolium is better suited for comparisons between phyla than the widely employed dipterans.

54," hyperglycemia occurs frequently in critically ill dogs hospitalized in intensive care units, and their morbidity is directly associated with their blood glucose concentration. in humans, functional defects in neutrophils that diminish the microbicidal and phagocytic function of the cells and increase the risk of bacterial infection are attributed to hyperglycemia. the molecular, biochemical and cellular basis of this decrease in immunological defense is not well understood in humans, and the relationship between hyperglycemia and neutrophil dysfunction in dogs remains to be adequately investigated. reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion and its derivatives, exert an important bactericidal function in neutrophils and are components of some of the conditions associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes. however, the effect of hyperglycemia on neutrophil production of ros is unclear. some studies have reported increased ros production in diabetic patients, and in healthy patients that underwent a hyperglycemic challenge. the reduction of the neutrophil oxidative burst in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus has also been described, but such alteration did not occur in patients with experimentally varied concentrations of blood glucose and with acute, induced hyperglycemia. there are many complex factors affecting the neutrophil respiratory burst in vivo, and different concentrations of blood glucose in patients can also affect the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils. thus, to minimize these factors, in vitro protocols have been used to provide an adequate understanding of how glucose concentrations can affect the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy individuals, when incubated with high concentrations of glucose in vitro, have lower superoxide anion production. in humans, the in vitro inhibition of neutrophil oxidative metabolism seems to be dependent on glucose concentration. perner et al. incubated neutrophils from healthy patients in solutions containing mmol/l, mmol/l and mmol/l of glucose and verified 50% inhibition of superoxide production in the highest glucose concentration. nielson et al. suggest that the suppressing effect of glucose on the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils is due to protein glycosylation. monosaccharides such as glucose, mannose and fructose form schiff-base adducts with proteins, which cause inhibition of neutrophil function. four mechanisms underlie the oxidative stress associated with hyperglycemia: increased polyol pathway flux, increased advanced glycation end product formation, activation of protein kinase c isoforms, and increased hexosamine pathway flux. there is evidence that oxidative stress in diabetics increases apoptosis of neurons, endothelial cells, pancreatic cells, mesangial cells, and renal podocytes. however, the relationship between hyperglycemia and neutrophil viability needs further study. according to tennenberg et al., high concentrations of blood glucose decrease the functional longevity of human neutrophils and increase neutrophil clearance from infected sites, possibly contributing to the increased susceptibility to and severity of infections in diabetic patients. in contrast, turina et al. observed no alteration in human neutrophil apoptosis when exposed to high concentrations of plasma glucose. in diabetic rats, the glycolytic metabolism and the protector effect of glutamine on neutrophils is altered, accelerating apoptosis and increasing susceptibility to infections. although dogs are commonly affected by diabetic hyperglycemia and are considered the best animal model for the study of human diabetes, there are few studies examining the effect of glucose on neutrophil oxidative metabolism and apoptosis in dogs. the decrease in nadph oxidase activity seen in the neutrophils of dogs fed high levels of galactose results from excessive consumption of enzyme due to increased polyol pathway activity. in this circumstance, excessive consumption of nadph decreases superoxide production and compromises the bactericidal function of neutrophils. a diabetic retinopathy, similar to that which occurs in humans, was induced in dogs fed a 30% galactose diet. when isolated neutrophils from healthy dogs were incubated with a similar concentration of galactose there was no alteration in their apoptosis rate; however, in vivo evaluation of neutrophils revealed a lower apoptosis rate and higher adhesion in galactose-fed dogs. in vitro studies are necessary to evaluate the specific effects of glucose on neutrophil oxidative metabolism and apoptosis, especially in diabetic dogs and hyperglycemic conditions. the aim of this study was to test, in vitro, whether high concentrations of glucose inhibit the oxidative metabolism of isolated neutrophils from healthy dogs, and also to evaluate the viability and apoptosis rate of these cells when incubated in different concentrations of glucose.  a high glucose concentration inhibits the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils the interference of glucose with the oxidative metabolism of human neutrophils has been described. this interference was evaluated in dogs using the nbt reduction test to quantify the superoxide production of neutrophils from healthy dogs in rpmi medium containing a high concentration of glucose. neutrophils incubated in pure rpmi medium reduced significantly more nbt than neutrophils incubated in rpmi with a high concentration of glucose versus ± % ). thus, similar to the effects seen in human neutrophils in vitro, superoxide production decreased in canine neutrophils in the presence of a high concentration of glucose. however, no inhibitory effects on neutrophil oxidative metabolism were observed when the cells had been previously activated with pma. * different letters in the same column indicate a statistically significant difference. maintenance of neutrophil viability during incubation with a high concentration of glucose we compared the viability and apoptosis rate of neutrophils isolated from healthy dogs and incubated in pure rpmi media or in rpmi media with addition of glucose. the protocol for neutrophil isolation and incubation in rpmi media did not compromise cell viability, even though the glucose concentration of rpmi media is mmol/l, which is higher than that of normal dog plasma. when apoptosis was stimulated with cam, there was a decrease in viability associated with increased neutrophil apoptosis in both the pure and the glucose-enriched media. rpmi enriched with glucose resulted in a numerical increase in the apoptosis rate; however, this difference was not statistically significant. discussion multiple cellular factors have been associated with neutrophil dysfunction in hyperglycemic conditions. these include nicotinamide, protein components of nadph oxidase, intracytoplasmic cytokines, chemokines, expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and alterations in several different mechanisms of cellular activation as well as modifications of proteins and lipids. however, the complete mechanism underlying glucose-associated neutrophil dysfunction is still unknown. in this study, we verified in vitro that neutrophils of healthy dogs decrease superoxide production when incubated in a high concentration of glucose. similar results were observed in human neutrophils incubated with elevated concentrations of glucose such as ≥ mmol/l, ≥ mmol/l and mmol/l. these results reinforce the affirmation of ionut et al. that the dog is the most suitable model for the study of human diabetes. the in vitro inhibitory effect of glucose on the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils has also been observed in humans in vivo; however, some studies did not find alterations in the oxidative metabolism of diabetic patients, while others found increased oxidative metabolism. this discrepancy among the results of studies that evaluated neutrophil oxidative metabolism may be due to the heterogeneity of their protocols; different concentrations of glucose were used, various stimuli were used to activate the cells, and oxidative metabolism was assessed by different methods. although the nbt method is not able to determine the precise concentration of superoxide produced, in this study and in others it was possible to assess neutrophil oxidative metabolism using this method. neutrophil activation occurs by a variety of distinct mechanisms of signal transduction. some neutrophil activators depend on complement, while others require opsonization and others, such as n-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine, depend on specific protein receptors. in this study, the potent neutrophil activator pma was used. pma does not require receptors to activate nadph oxidase, instead inducing superoxide production directly by protein kinase c activation. according to mcmanus et al., in diabetic patients neutrophil activation occurs only in the presence of stimuli that initiate signal transduction via g-protein coupled receptors, thus it does not occur in the presence of pma. this may explain why excessive glucose in the media did not alter the oxidative metabolism of neutrophils activated with pma, and suggests that the inhibition of oxidative metabolism observed in the trials without pma is due to a failure in g-protein coupled signal transduction, which is responsible for nadph oxidase activation. there is evidence that a high concentration of glucose decreases neutrophil functional longevity in humans and increases neutrophil clearance from infected sites, possibly contributing to the increased susceptibility to and severity of infections in diabetic patients. the mechanisms related to the acceleration of apoptosis during hyperglycemia are associated with decreased resistance to oxidative stress, increases in protein glycosylation, and decreased protective effect of glutamine. oxidative stress associated with short-term hyperglycemia increases the apoptosis rate of neurons and renal podocytes. conversely in our study, neutrophils maintained for a short period in glucose-rich media did not have an increased apoptosis rate. similar results were observed in human neutrophils incubated for h with high and low concentrations of glucose. similarly, no acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis was observed in diabetes-induced dogs and rats. therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the varying results regarding the assessment of neutrophil apoptosis in short-period experiments are due to a pro-apoptotic effect of glucose that only occurs in conditions of persistent hyperglycemia.  this study provides the first evidence that high concentrations of glucose inhibit the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils in vitro, and that this inhibition does not alter the apoptosis rate and viability of the neutrophils. high concentrations of glucose may rapidly affect the membrane receptors responsible for the activation of nadph oxidase; in this way even short-term hyperglycemia can compromise the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils. however, further investigations are required to evaluate the clinical implications of these results. "," dogs are commonly affected by hyperglycemic conditions. hyperglycemia compromises the immune response and favors bacterial infections; however, reports on the effects of glucose on neutrophil oxidative metabolism and apoptosis are conflicting in humans and rare in dogs. considering the many complex factors that affect neutrophil oxidative metabolism in vivo, we investigated in vitro the specific effect of high concentrations of glucose on superoxide production and apoptosis rate in neutrophils from healthy dogs.  the capacity of the neutrophils to reduce tetrazolium nitroblue decreased significantly in the higher concentration of glucose versus ± % ). however, there were no changes in tetrazolium nitroblue reduction at different glucose concentrations when the neutrophils were first activated with phorbol myristate acetate. high concentrations of glucose did not affect the viability and apoptosis rate of canine neutrophils either with or without prior camptothecin stimulation. this study provides the first evidence that high concentrations of glucose inhibit the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils in vitro in a manner similar to that which occurs in humans, and that the decrease in superoxide production did not increase the apoptosis rate.  a high concentration of glucose reduces the oxidative metabolism of canine neutrophils in vitro. it is likely that glucose at high concentrations rapidly affects membrane receptors responsible for the activation of nadph oxidase in neutrophils; therefore, the nonspecific immune response can be compromised in dogs with acute and chronic hyperglycemic conditions. superoxiderespiratory burstprogrammed cell deathleukocyte dysfunctionhyperglycemia ",d6bcfe4d-e24e-417e-a991-2902290f434e,pubmed
55," addison's disease, also referred to as chronic adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenocorticism, has been reported in many individual dogs. although mixed breeds present as the ""breed"" most frequently diagnosed with addison's, certain pure-breds, including the great dane, rottweiler, standard poodle, portuguese water dog, west highland white terrier, and wheaton terrier, experience a disproportionate level of prevalence of the disease. the defining characteristic in addison's disease is the failure of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient quantities of steroid hormones. addison's can be characterized as either primary or secondary depending upon the site of impairment, with primary being most common in dogs. the symptoms associated with addison's are often diffuse reflecting the general metabolic influence of the hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, inappetence, depression, and weight loss,. addison's disease in humans has long been characterized as an inherited trait induced by autoimmune-mediated destruction of the adrenal cortex. similar to the human, the majority of dogs present with primary addison's disease in which the adrenal cortex exhibits severe deterioration mediated by an autoimmune reaction. an inherited susceptibility for addison's has been proposed for more than dog breeds. yet even though canine addison's is well documented to run in families, the mode of inheritance is unclear. one breed, the standard poodle, exhibits the presence of a single major autosomal locus affecting expression, while another breed, the bearded collie, has a less definitive mode of inheritance for addison's. we undertook genetic analysis to characterize the inheritance of addison's in a third breed having a low genetic relationship to the standard poodle to clarify whether unrelated breeds demonstrate unique modes of inheritance for addison's as has been demonstrated for other disorders such as blood clotting. in particular, the heritability and mode of inheritance have not been defined for the portuguese water dog although breeders recognize that addison's is a concern in the breed. knowledge of a genetic influence on the expression of addison's in the portuguese water dog would assist breeders in making breeding decisions that would decrease the incidence of addison's in their breed. in this study, the heritability and the mode of inheritance, as determined by complex segregation analysis, are reported for the portuguese water dog.  heritability complex segregation analysis of the total dogs in this study, dogs were inbred; their average inbreeding coefficient was. there were as many as seven overlapping generations included in the families under study and not all dogs within the study had equivalent number of generations evaluated. nevertheless, with an eye toward making simple recommendations to breeders, the relationship between inbreeding and the risk for addison's disease should be evaluated. while the data set does not permit computation of the level of inbreeding of portuguese water dogs as a whole, the relationship between addison's and inbreeding can be assessed. classifying affected and unaffected dogs by their inbreeding coefficient can reveal a simple relationship between level of inbreeding and the presence of disease. in the present study, among dogs with an inbreeding coefficient between zero and, of dogs were recorded as affected by addison's. however, as the level of inbreeding increased, the risk of addison's disease increased with it. specifically, for portuguese water dogs with an inbreeding coefficient between and there were affected dogs among a total of dogs. for those dogs with an inbreeding coefficient between and there were of dogs affected by addison's. though a small sample, among dogs with an inbreeding coefficient greater than there were affected dogs among a total of. this result is consistent with the results of table in that inbreeding increases homozygosity, and a disease that is strongly influenced by a segregating recessive locus should see an increased incidence among a cluster of inbred animals. discussion the objective of this study was to assess the genetic contribution to the expression of addison's disease in the portuguese water dog. the results provide sufficient and convincing evidence that addison's disease in the portuguese water dog is an inherited disorder. the mode of inheritance, determined in the present data set, is consistent with a single, autosomal recessive locus. this finding should be helpful to breeders as they struggle to reduce the prevalence of this disorder in the breed. unfortunately, given the relatively late onset of illness, the evaluation of dogs at risk for expressing addison's disease, or identification of carriers, is not straightforward. however, the evidence for the contributions of a single locus suggests that a genome scan for the putative disease-causing allele is advisable. identification of the allelic mutation would enable the identification of dogs at risk or carriers prior to their contribution to the gene pool. comparison of tables and also demonstrates a basic equivalence in estimates of the narrow sense heritability across the two computational approaches. that is, the complex segregation analysis also provides an estimate of a polygenic contribution to disease. the estimate of the mean of the posterior density for the polygenic variance component was, implying an estimate of heritability of the polygenic component as = /; a value well within the margins of error for the heritability estimate in table note that the 95% hdr for the polygenic variance does not include but the interval does indicate that the polygenic contribution could be very small. this suggests that the putative major locus for addison's disease is not likely to be the sole determinant of the disease expression. the genetic contributions of the polygenic component may reflect other genes influencing the progression of the disorder. alternatively, inclusion of dogs as ""unaffected"" in the statistical analyses when in fact the dogs have not yet expressed the disease may influence our estimate of the posterior density of the polygenic variance. this in turn may disturb our estimates of the limits for the 95% hdr affecting our conclusions on the potential for a polygenic contribution to addison's disease over and above that of the putative major locus. an additional caution must be exercised concerning dogs that are designated addisonian when in fact they may not be due to iatrogenic adrenal suppression or other instances of adrenal insufficiency. accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical to any genetic transmission study due to artificially inflated statistical significance if inaccurately diagnosed dogs are incorrectly classified. while these uncertainties remain, in the present study, the consistency of transmission of addison's disease and the reliance upon veterinarian diagnoses should mitigate those concerns. though not presented in table for the sake of brevity, several models were fit in the complex segregation analysis. specifically, fitting these models are intended to reduce the probability of a false detection of a major locus; models in which the assumption of mendelian transmission of the alleles of the putative major locus are relaxed. the null model is mendelian transmission, and this model should be a significant improvement for the likelihood over the no-major locus model if we are to draw the conclusion that a major locus is segregating in this population of dogs. ""improvement"", when working in the bayesian framework provided by ibay, is reliant upon the examination of the 95% hdr. in our examination of addison's disease in the portuguese water dog, allowing for non-mendelian transmission of the putative major alleles did not improve the fit: the 95% hdr for the transmission probabilities demonstrated considerable overlap with the mendelian transmission values. for this reason we accept the conclusion of the simplest null model that of the major locus model with alleles moving from parent to offspring with the typically expected probabilities. though complex segregation analysis is fraught with challenging statistical issues, the estimate of the allele frequency for the putative disease allele in the base population is. accordingly, for our suggested major locus model one would predict that 24% of dogs would be affected with addison's disease in a randomly mating population. the observed incidence in the data set is considerably lower with affected dogs out of, suggesting that breeders may be selecting parents so as to reduce the risk of disease. such a high expected prevalence of addison's greatly increases the power of identifying linkage by facilitating the detection of segregating markers in a genome-wide scan. in an effort to simply assess whether the portuguese water dog family in the present study offers the power to detect genetic linkage with the addison's phenotype, we simulated a recessive locus perfectly linked with addison's in a subset of the larger portuguese water dog family and computed expected lod scores in a linkage analysis. the predicted lod score of a marker within cm of the addisonian locus in a small subset family of dogs was using the crimap analysis program giving support to the concept that the family under study offers the power to detect genetic linkage with the addison's phenotype. as in a similar analysis of the standard poodle, there is no evidence for a sex difference in risk of addison's disease for portuguese water dogs. this suggests that the literature reports of a greater prevalence among females may represent an artifact of the sample populations evaluated: dogs referred to teaching hospitals rather than dogs evaluated by all veterinarians. the results of the present study also are consistent with the published evidence of the mode of inheritance for addison's disease in the standard poodle. in both the portuguese water dog and the standard poodle, the data support the view that the disease is inherited as a single autosomal recessive trait. in contrast, although highly heritable, the mode of inheritance of addison's disease in the bearded collie is less clear. this disparity in the mode of inheritance predictions possibly stems from the variability in the onset of the disorder and the classification of dogs as ""unaffected"" in the statistical analyses when in fact the dogs have not yet expressed the disease. the consistency of high heritability for the addisonian phenotype across these different breeds supports the possibility that addison's may have a common mode of inheritance for dogs in general. this concept is supported given the high incidence among mixed breeds and the recent determination that large haplotype regions are shared across multiple dog breeds suggesting that genetic liability predisposition may likewise be shared.  until early clinical detection of addisonian status exists or genetic tests are available to identify dogs at risk for developing addison's disease or those dogs that are carriers of the mutant allele, breeders of portuguese water dogs should consider the genetic contribution to the expression of addison's disease. although the present study cannot confirm the mode of inheritance, the putative mode of inheritance as an autosomal recessive disorder suggests that breeders could actively select against generating affected dogs in their breeding programs. "," addison's disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, has been reported in many individual dogs, although some breeds exhibit a greater incidence than the population as a whole. addison's is presumed to be an autoimmune mediated hereditary defect but the mode of inheritance remains unclear. in particular, the heritability and mode of inheritance have not been defined for the portuguese water dog although addison's is known to be prevalent in the breed.  the analyses present clear evidence that establishes addison's disease as an inherited disorder in the portuguese water dog with an estimate of heritability of; there were no differences in risk for disease across sexes. further, the complex segregation analysis provides suggestive evidence that addison's disease in the portuguese water dog is inherited under the control of a single, autosomal recessive locus.  the high heritability and mode of inheritance of addison's disease in the portuguese water dog should enable the detection of segregating markers in a genome-wide scan and the identification of a locus linked to addison's. though the confirmation of addison's disease as an autosomal recessive disorder must wait until the gene is identified, breeders of these dogs may wish to keep the present findings in mind as they plan their breeding programs to select against producing affected dogs.

56," enterobacter sakazakii is an emergent pathogen that is associated with neonatal infection. most reported outbreaks have occurred in neonatal intensive care units and some have been linked to the ingestion of contaminated powdered infant milk formula. e. sakazakii was defined as a new species by farmer et al. using dna-dna hybridization the previously'yellow pigmented enterobacter cloacae' was shown to be 41–54% related to enterobacter and citrobacter species. farmer et al. described biogroups of e. sakazakii based on biochemical profiles with the wild type biogroup being the most common. since prokaryotic systematics has changed with the increasing use of 16s rdna sequence analysis. harada and ishikawa used dna sequence analysis of the groel operon to determine the phylogenetic relationship among enterobacter, pantoea, klebsiella, serratia and erwinia species. hoffmann and roggenkamp used hsp dna sequence variation to investigate e. cloacae polyphyletic groups. previously, it has been shown by both partial 16s rdna and hsp gene sequencing that isolates identified as e. sakazakii using commercial identification kits form at least four distinct clusters. recently, an artificial neural network has been published which identified key biochemical and 16s rdna sequences that distinguish e. sakazakii from closely related organisms. in this study, we compare the biogroups of strains with the four 16s rdna cluster groups. we also identified key biochemical characteristics for the differentiation of these four genotypes. this significantly extends the previous work of farmer et al., which used five strains to genetically define the species and a total of strains to define biogroups.  biogroups the biochemical profiles obtained for each strain were compared to the biogroups originally described by farmer et al. clinical strains were distributed among fourteen of the biogroups. the defining tests were motility, voges-proskauer, methyl red, indole, ornithine decarboxylase, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, production of gas from d-glucose, malonate utilization and production of acid from myo-inositol and dulcitol. where strains could not be assigned to an original biogroup, a new biogroup or subgroup was designated. the majority of isolates were in biogroup with the e. sakazakii atcc 29544t type strain. these strains were motile, produced gas from glucose, produced acid from inositol, reduced nitrate and were positive for voges-proskauer and ornithine decarboxylase, but negative for methyl red, indole, malonate utilization and acid production from dulcitol. biogroup contained isolates negative for acid production from inositol; four of these were also non-motile. biogroup contained six strains and biogroup contained nine strains three of which were non-motile. biogroup was positive for malonate utilization and six of these were non-motile. biogroup was positive for indole and biogroup was negative for gas production from glucose. biogroup was defined by the inability to reduce nitrate. two of these strains were positive in the malonate test, three were negative for the inositol test and two were inositol negative but malonate positive. biogroup contained strains that were inositol negative and malonate positive. biogroup contained one strain that was inositol negative and indole positive, while biogroup contained one strain that was inositol negative and dulcitol positive. biogroup was also represented by only one strain, which was indole and malonate positive. the seven isolates in biogroup were negative for the voges-proskauer reaction, three were non-motile, one was negative for methyl red and one was negative for ornithine. biogroup was negative for ornithine decarboxylase and inositol, with four of these strains being positive for malonate. biogroup was positive for all the tests performed except methyl red. a new group had to be defined to accommodate strains which were inositol and dulcitol positive, but indole negative. they were malonate positive, with the exception of one strain. two strains were non-motile and one of these was also ornithine decarboxylase negative. acid production from α-methyl-d-glucoside was included in the original study and all biogroups were reported positive for this trait with the exception of biogroup as biogroup could be distinguished from the other biogroups without the α-methyl-d-glucoside test, this was not repeated for all strains in this study. phylogenetic analysis partial 16s rdna sequences containing less than 1% undetermined positions were obtained for all strains in this study. the sequences were analysed using the maximum parsimony method, which is an evolutionary model that searches for the simplest tree that can be constructed using the fewest inferred changes between characters. the topology was optimised using simulated annealing, a heuristic that occasionally accepts a worse tree during the course of the search allowing it to escape local optima. this method is more economical than the more usual heuristic searches, which can require many randon re-starts, especially with large data matrices. in agreement with previous reports, the isolates used in this study were divided into four genomic groups by 16s rdna sequence analysis. the majority of the presumptive e. sakazakii isolates in this study clustered with the type strain. cluster was composed of the majority of biogroups, biogroups 1– 7– and the isolates forming the new proposed biogroup corresponded with e. sakazakii cluster, with between – % 16s rdna sequence difference from the e. sakazakii type strain. no strains representative of this biochemical profile were included in the original study by farmer et al.. the six isolates in biogroup corresponded to e. sakazakii cluster. the four strains described as e. sakazakii cluster represent biogroups and for this dataset, the four partial 16s rdna cluster groups can be distinguished biochemically using the indole, dulcitol, and inositol tests. cluster strains are variable for inositol, negative for indole, and dulcitol; with the exception of biogroup which is dulcitol positive and inositol negative. cluster – biogroup strains are positive for inositol and dulcitol but negative for indole. cluster – biogroup is positive for inositol, dulcitol and indole. cluster strains were also positive for indole but can be distinguished from cluster as they are negative for dulcitol. one of the strains in cluster was inositol negative and one was malonate positive. there were insufficient isolates in cluster biogroups to determine whether these biogroups could be further genomically divided. discussion farmer et al. described biogroups of strains of e. sakazakii. five strains were used to genetically define the species by dna-dna hybridization and the remaining strain definitions were phenotypic. this study defines isolates in terms of both phenotype and genotype and extends the initial study with the analysis of strains. according to partial 16s rdna sequence analysis the majority of e. sakazakii strains clustered with the type strain, and within this cluster there was no clear further genomic division corresponding to biogroup. a second cluster of closely related strains was identified which were biochemically distinct from cluster and formed a biogroup that had not been previously described by farmer et al. these strains were not assigned a species match using the microseq or supplemental bacterial databases, but the nearest match was e. sakazakii. biogroup corresponds to e. sakazakii cluster while biogroups and correspond to e. sakazakii cluster. analysis of the full 16s sequence of strains corresponding to cluster groups and show these are less than 3% divergent from cluster group although dna-dna hybridization is the acknowledged standard for species delineation this technique was beyond the scope of this study, which focuses on evaluation of the biogroups reported when e. sakazakii was originally described. as well as defining a new biogroup, this study found subgroups within the original biogroups. the malonate and motility tests account for the majority of the subdivisions of the original biogroups. in this study, the majority of food isolates belonged to biogroups and all biogroups except and contained at least one strain from a clinical source. the greatest number of clinical strains was found to belong to biogroup. however, this included isolates out of the ten from the same hospital. therefore this may not be an indication of increased pathogenicity of this biogroup, but is likely due to an over representation of one clonal type from a single source. most of the food isolates belonged to biogroups and  biogroup was the major group with approximately one third of the e. sakazakii strains. cluster was the major dna cluster, and was composed of biogroups 1– 7– and cluster is equivalent to biogroup and a new biogroup was designated for the strains in cluster for this dataset it is possible to differentiate the four genomic clusters using indole, dulcitol and inositol tests.

57," fishes of the families cichlidae and labridae represent good probable examples of vertebrate adaptive radiations. although the two families inhabit different aquatic environments, both families have radiated into several hundreds to over a thousand of species exhibiting various feeding modes. in terms of species richness, cichlids exceed labrids. indeed, biomechanical studies of lower jaw shapes quantitatively demonstrated that the labrid functional diversity in lower jaw was well comparable to that of all ray-finned fishes. the dramatic radiation of the cichlid and labrid fishes is widely believed to result from the ""key innovation"" of a unique pharyngeal jaw apparatus. generalized percomorph fishes, from which the cichlids and labrids were derived, have upper and lower ""pharyngeal jaws"" within the throat, which function chiefly to transport food into the esophagus, whereas the ""oral jaws"" have a task of both collecting and manipulating food. in the cichlid and labrid fishes, the pharyngeal jaws and attached muscles was modified into a derived condition with three major features: 1) the left and right lower jaw elements are fused into a single structure, 2) the lower jaw is suspended in a muscular sling that runs from the neurocranium to the posterior muscular arms of the lower jaw, and 3) the upper jaw elements have a diarthrotic articulation with the underside of the neurocranium. the unique condition of the pja is assumed to allow efficient manipulation of food. liem has suggested that the evolution of the uniquely modified pja in cichlids and labrids freed the oral jaws from the task of food manipulation, allowing it to diversify into various food-collecting modes. although this scenario is one of the most well-known examples of an evolutionary key innovation, it has never been evaluated adequately. unfortunately, the key innovation hypothesis on the specialized pja has been proposed being coupled with a taxonomic hypothesis that has widely been accepted ever since: the family labridae and cichlidae have been classified into the suborder labroidei, together with pomacentridae and embiotocidae, based on the sharing of the specialized pja. according to stiassny & jensen, the specialized pja has seven morphological features including the above three major ones. none of them is, however, unique to labroid fishes, although there is no other group known to have them all. moreover, there is no independent, corroborative evidence for a monophyletic labroidei outside of the specialized pja. this situation has led some evolutionary biologists to doubt not only the taxonomic hypothesis but also the key innovation hypothesis. the doubt about the latter hypothesis is a little rash, however, because appropriateness of the evolutionary hypothesis essentially does not depend on that of the appended taxonomic hypothesis. a discussion of the specialized pja as a key innovation, however, hinges, first of all, upon a phylogenetic hypothesis independent of pharyngeal characters as below. the widely-accepted taxonomic hypothesis assumed that the evolution of the specialized pja occurred only once during the percomorph evolution, a situation that has prevented the famous evolutionary example from being examined from the aspect of historical repeatability. the traditional taxonomic hypothesis based on the sharing of the specialized pja, however, needs reconsideration. phylogeny independent of the pja may come to demonstrate multiple origins of the specialized pja followed by trophic radiations, which support the key innovation hypothesis at least from the aspect of the historical repeatability. the hypothesis, however, must be tested statistically by comparing the diversity of the clades with the trait to that of the sister taxa without that trait when the true sister taxa are found in a future study. for the first step of evaluating the key innovation hypothesis on the specialized pja, we examined labroid monophyly based on whole mitochondrial genome sequences from a variety of the perciformes and related other ordinal taxa. usefulness of whole mitochondrial genome sequences for resolving higher-level phylogenetic relationships of teleost has been demonstrated in several studies. although non-monophyly of the labroid families have been suggested in previous studies, limited sequence data used in these studies have precluded them from drawing definite conclusions, and no statistical test has been conducted for corroborating that hypothesis. our analysis used the whole mitochondrial genome sequences, and confirmed the independent origins of the two diversified families by statistical tests using bayes factors.  the final dna alignment contains nucleotide sites for the taxa listed in table of the sites, were variable and informative under the parsimony criterion. partitioned bayesian analyses based on three differently-weighted datasets, # #, and #, recovered nearly identical topologies. figure shows a 50% majority rule consensus tree of the pooled trees from two independent bayesian analyses for dataset # it was fully bifurcated with the exception of an unresolved trichotomy denoted by an arrow, and most internal branches were supported by 100% posterior probabilities. topological differences among results from the three datasets were shown only in the trichotomy and five internal branches denoted by arrowheads in fig. in the resultant trees, every family of the suborder labroidei was monophyletic with 100% pps, and moreover, the family labridae was phylogenetically distant from the remaining three labroid families forming clade b. monophyly of the labroidei comprised of all the four families was confidently rejected by a statistical test using bayes factor. the family pseudochromidae, which was sometimes thought to be a possible sister to the labridae based on larval morphology, was placed not close to the labridae, but more closely related to the clade b. discussion percomorpha phylogeny overall relationships among the percomorph fishes examined here were quite similar to those obtained by unweighted and weighted maximum-parsimony analyses in miya et al., except for the newly added fishes, such as labroids. although the phylogenies recovered many interesting inter-subordinal relationships that were not congruent with the traditional classification, sparse taxon sampling outside the labroidei precludes further discussions. labroid phylogeny the resultant trees and the statistical test with bayes factor demonstrated that the labridae and the remaining three labroid families including cichlidae have independent origins within the percomorpha. based on molecular analyses, various relationships among the labroid families have been so far proposed. our analysis demonstrated entirely different relationships from the various ones with high statistical support, whereas none of the previous relationships was supported with high statistical value, probably owing to short sequences. the present analyses were conducted based on the long nucleotide sequences more than six times the lengths of those so far used. in spite of the high statistical supports, we must keep in mind that the sister relationships obtained here are highly tentative because of the sparse taxon sampling compared to the tremendous taxonomic diversity of the percomorpha. that is to say, although the present phylogeny demonstrated that the three labroid families, cichlidae, pomacentridae, and embiotocidae, formed a well-supported monophyletic group without non-labroid taxa, there remains a possibility that some non-labroid taxa would break into the group when more extensive taxon sampling is conducted. in the same way, there remains not a few possibilities that some yet-to-be-analyzed taxa would become sister group of the ""labroid"" taxa. to evaluate these possibilities, we need to conduct analyses with more extensive taxon sampling. in doing so, we would be able to evaluate ""key innovation"" hypothesis in a more rigorous manner using statistical test. implications of the revised labroid phylogeny the present result supports, from the aspect of historical repeatability, the famous evolutionary hypothesis that the dramatic labroid radiations in trophic ecology are due to evolution of specialized pharyngeal jaw apparatus. based on the present phylogeny, a single origin of the specialized pja in a common ancestor of the suborder labroidei is unlikely, because such an evolutionary scenario requires subsequent losses of the complex structures in a wide variety of percomorphs. rather, it is plausible that the specialized pja has evolved twice independently in the percomorpha history, in a common ancestor of the labridae and that of the cichlidae, pomacentridae, and embiotocidae. interestingly, evolutionary radiations in jaw forms and head shape have occurred within both of the lineages with specialized pja: one in the labridae, and the other in the cichlidae. the independent occurrence of such evolutionary succession appears to support the idea that the evolution of the specialized pja provided these lineages with the morphological ""potential"" for trophic radiations. despite their specialized pja, the pomacentridae and embiotocidae seem not to have experienced clear trophic radiation. this may reflect the context-dependence of a key trait's effect on diversification. there are many potential factors that could influence how a key trait affects diversification. de queiroz categorized these factors roughly into three types: other taxa, other traits of the group itself, and the physical environment. evolutionary radiations in african great lake cichlids are supposedly facilitated by colonization of novel habitats without other competitive taxa. the pomacentridae and embiotocidae, both of which inhabit coastal marine waters, may not have had such opportunity to colonize novel habitats without competitors. evolution of the specialized ""labroid"" pja it is interesting fact that the complex ""labroid"" pja evolved multiply in the percomorpha history. is the acquisition of the ""successful"" pja not so difficult for percomorph fishes, like parallel evolution of trophic morphologies in african great lake cichlids? according to stiassny & jensen, typical labroid pja has seven features. interestingly, none of them is unique to labroid fishes, though there is no other group known to have them all. in addition to it, it seems that such features can be accomplished by a very simple change in ontogenetic mechanism. the labroid pja is therefore considered to have been achieved through the unique combination of several commonplace and slight morphological modifications. it will be worthwhile to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphological modifications, which would reveal molecular basis for the probable key innovations. according to hulsey et al., more than ten genes have been so far recognized which putatively influence teleost pharyngeal jaw. the present result will provide a new view point for functional morphology of the unique organ. although many works on the trophic apparatus have been so far published, comparison between labrid and other labroid fishes as evolutionary independent lineages has never been conducted. careful comparisons, particularly based on more extensive phylogenies including labroid and non-labroid fishes possessing ""partly"" specialized pja, will shed light on overlooked evolutionary implications.  the phylogenetic analyses of whole mitochondrial dnas from various labroid and non-labroid ""percomorph"" fishes revealed that the labridae and the remaining three labroid families have diverged basally within percomorpha, indicating that the specified ""labroid"" pja evolved independently at least twice, once in labridae and once in the common ancestor of the remaining three labroid families. because both of the evolution appear to be followed by trophic radiations, we consider that our result supports the idea that the evolution of the specialized pja provided these lineages with the morphological potential for their spectacular trophic radiations. the present result will provide a new view point for functional morphology of the unique organ:

"," fishes in the families cichlidae and labridae provide good probable examples of vertebrate adaptive radiations. their spectacular trophic radiations have been widely assumed to be due to structural key innovation in pharyngeal jaw apparatus, but this idea has never been tested based on a reliable phylogeny. for the first step of evaluating the hypothesis, we investigated the phylogenetic positions of the components of the suborder labroidei within the percomorpha, the most diversified crown clade of teleosts. we examined those based on whole mitochondrial genome sequences through partitioned bayesian analyses with concatenated sequences.  the resultant phylogenies indicated that the labridae and the remaining three labroid families have diverged basally within the percomorpha, and monophyly of the suborder was confidently rejected by statistical tests using bayes factors.  the resultant phylogenies indicated that the specified pja evolved independently at least twice, once in labridae and once in the common ancestor of the remaining three labroid families. because the independent evolution of pharyngeal jaws appears to have been followed by trophic radiations, we consider that our result supports, from the aspect of historical repeatability, the idea that the evolution of the specialized pja provided these lineages with the morphological potential for their spectacular trophic radiations. the present result will provide a new framework for the study of functional morphology and genetic basis of their pja.

58," it is recognized that small regions of proteins tend to fold independently and are then stabilized by interactions between these distinct subunits or modules. the dissection of proteins into structurally independent and functionally distinct subunits led to the idea that proteins can be considered as collections of smaller units such as domains. different definitions of domains have been in existence. while some define a domain as a recognizable substructure within a protein and connected to other domains by very few structural elements such as a loop or a helix, others define domains as a parts of a protein molecule that behave in a quasi-independent manner and are considered as cooperative units in protein folding. a further definition describes a domain as a relatively compact part of a protein that is characterized by its own pattern of intramolecular collective dynamics and which are distinguishable from those of other domains. in the belief that an unequivocal definition of a module must be based on the most fundamental property of protein 3d structure, namely, the adjacency matrix of inter-residues contact, we adopted a network representation of the protein. in an earlier work, we had used a well-established, global method for identifying modules in networks. the algorithm converges towards the maximization of the modularity of the given protein network; the network being defined by an adjacency matrix with a denoting the existence of residue-residue contacts and a for non-contacts. maximizing the modularity score, as defined by guimera et al. results in maximizing intra-module contacts while minimizing the inter-module contacts. the modularity m is given by m=∑s=1nmlsl− where nm is the number of modules, l is the number of links in the network, l is the number of links between nodes in module s and d is the sum of the degrees of the node in module s. in doing so, this allows the representation of the residues of the protein in terms of their intra-module degree, z and participation coefficient, p., which are given by zi=κi−κsj−σκsjpi=1−∑s=1nm where κi is the number of links of residue i to other residues in its module si, κ¯sj is the average of κ over all residues in module sj, ωκsj is the standard deviation of κ in module sj, κis is the number of links of node i to nodes in module s and ki is the total degree of node i. we demonstrated that the labeling of residues in terms of these invariants, allowed for information rich representations of the studied proteins as well as to sketch a new way to link sequence, structure and the dynamical properties of proteins. we discovered a strong invariant character of protein molecules in terms of p/z characterization, pointing to a common topological design of all protein structures. this invariant representation, applied to different protein systems enabled us to identify the possible functional role of high p/z residues during the folding process. effectively, this invariance is a cartographic representation of the contact network for proteins and is represented by the plot of the residues in the p - z space. since it is identical for all the proteins, it does not embed any structural peculiarities or information for separating between different protein folds. we also observed that the modules identified using the procedure outlined above correlated well with early folding units or ""foldons"" and thus a knowledge of the modules existing in a given protein can help to identify residues that are critical for folding. a significant use for the modules identified using our methodology is for the development of algorithms for protein 3d structure determination. in addition knowing the modules for a protein can help in the understanding of the folding pathway for that protein since residues with high |p/z| values tend to be protected during transition state and hence are fixed early in the folding process. the modules can also be used for engineering new enzymes which is typically carried out by building a chimera of multiple proteins by cutting and pasting sequences from the respective proteins. a knowledge of the modules can guide the cuts in order to obtain chimeras that can fold in-vitro. in addition models of such early folding units can be invaluable in understanding the biochemical pathways of diseases that are known to be pathological through partially folded forms of proteins leading to the development of therapeutics. implementation and  gandivaweb the gandivaweb webserver is based on the gandiva algorithm which is an implementation of the guimera algorithm that uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the modularity score, instead of simulated annealing which was used in the original algorithm. the algorithm has been written in c and was developed using the parallel genetic algorithm pgapack, the gnu scientific library and the openmpi and mpich mpi implementations. the webserver has three main functionalities: it displays the results from the application of the modularity algorithm gandiva on a set of single-chain, globular proteins that were used as the basis for the work done in. the main functionality of the website however, is the ability to process an uploaded protein structure file using gandiva and to send the results back to the user. since gandiva is a stochastic algorithm, the algorithm is run a number of times and the best results, as denoted by the largest modularity score obtained, is emailed back to the user. the user can set certain parameters like the maximum number of modules to be determined, the number of times to run the algorithm, the number of generations for the genetic algorithm as well as the number of generations for the fitness score to remain constant before it is assumed to have converged to a solution. an algorithm that takes into account the size of the protein as well as the number of jobs in the queue for the cluster, notifies the user about the expected time required for the completion of the job. the results emailed back to the user are made up of the following parts: • a results file that contains the details of the modular decomposition of the protein. the results file contains the modularity score in the first line. this is succeeded by the following columns: residue number, module number, intra-module connectivity, inter-module participation coefficient, p/z, |p/z|. the second column indicates the module to which each residue belongs. in addition to the results file, five different figures are generated. • along with the results file four figures are also included in the final results. the first two figures and 1) show cartoon representations of the protein with the residues colored according to the modules that they belong to and the |p/z| value, respectively. high |p/z| valued residues act as structural stabilizers and have been found to be correlated with the residues that are protected in the transition phase. • the third figure shows a scatter plot of the residues on the p - z plane. this scatter plot is overlaid on the scatter plot of the residues for the proteins studied in. marked deviation from the typical ""dentist's chair"" shape for a particular protein suggests non-native contacts. • the fourth and fifth figures show contour plots of the distribution of the buried and surface residues plot) and the hydrophobic and polar residues over the topological p - z space, respectively. the distributions were obtained by first calculating the residue accessible surface area and hydrophobicities respectively for each residue followed by partitioning the p - z space into an × grid and then calculating the mean value of the rasa and hydrophobicities in each bin. the mean value for each cell of the × grid was then plotted as a contour plot. significant differences have been observed between these distributions for native and decoy proteins, with native distributions showing more structure. the third functionality of the webserver is in displaying the results obtained using gandiva. the user can upload the pdb file and the results file and view the results in the embedded jmol viewer. for both functionalities and the user can choose to view the protein colored by the modules that the residues belong to or by the |p/z| values. the user can also choose to view only hydrophobic, only polar or all the residues. additionally, the viewer can choose the graphical representations of the protein that are a part of the embedded viewer. discussion the gandivaweb server has been designed to partition any given pdb structure into modules. the modules thus obtained correlate well with autonomous folding units. additionally, high |p/z| valued residues are identified. these residues have been shown to correlate well with residues that are protected early during the folding process. a knowledge of such units can help in understanding the folding process. it can also be used for engineering enzymes as mentioned earlier. enzymes are typically engineered by cutting and pasting sequences from multiple proteins. knowing the ""natural"" boundaries of protein folding modules can guide the ""cuts"" required in order to engineer proteins that can fold in-vitro. moreover, the knowledge of early folding units can help in understanding the biophysical and biochemical causes of diseases that are caused by the misfolding of proteins.  we believe that the gandivaweb server will be of immense use to scientists interested in the phenomena of protein folding and those studying the architectural and structural organization of proteins. additionally, the site will also be useful for scientists interested in the engineering of novel enzymes by providing them with a modularized view of the protein. availability the webserver can be found at authors' contributions ak wrote the main algorithm and wrote the paper. tl designed and implemented the webserver and also helped in the writing of the paper. mt was in charge of the overall project. "," it has long been known that small regions of proteins tend to fold independently and are then stabilized by interactions between these distinct subunits or modules. such units, also known as autonomous folding units or""foldons"" play a key role in protein folding. a knowledge of such early folding units has diverse applications in protein engineering as well as in developing an understanding of the protein folding process. such afus can also be used as model systems in order to study the structural organization of proteins.  in an earlier work, we had utilized a global network partitioning algorithm to identify modules in proteins. we had shown that these modules correlate well with afus. in this work, we have developed a webserver, gandivaweb, to identify early folding units or ""foldons"" in networks using the algorithm described earlier. the website has three functionalities: it is able to display information on the modularity of a database of proteins used in the original work, it can take as input an uploaded pdb file, identify the modules using the gandiva algorithm and email the results back to the user and it can take as input an uploaded pdb file and a results file ) and display the results using the embedded viewer. the results include the module decomposition of the protein, plots of cartoon representations of the protein colored by module identity and connectivity as well as contour plots of the hydrophobicity and relative accessible surface area distributions.  we believe that the gandivaweb server, will be a useful tool for scientists interested in the phenomena of protein folding as well as in protein engineering. our tool not only provides a knowledge of the afus through a natural graph partitioning approach but is also able to identify residues that are critical during folding. it is our intention to use this tool to study the topological determinants of protein folding by analyzing the topological changes in proteins over the unfolding/folding pathways.

59," ectodermal dysplasia is a genetic disease characterized by abnormal development of tissues and organs of ectodermal origin, including teeth, hair, nails and sweat glands. there are different forms of ed, the most common of which is caused by mutations in x-linked ectodysplasin gene a. it has been described in human, mouse, dog and cattle. common features shown by the affected individuals are hypodontia, sparse hair and absence of sweat glands. numerous mutations in the x-linked eda gene have been identified as the cause of disease in human and mouse. in cattle, the gene eda is located on chromosome x q and encodes ectodyslpasin-a, a membrane protein expressed in keratinocytes, hair follicles and sweat glands, which is involved in the interaction between cell and cell and/or cell and matrix. the eda gene may encode for two protein isoforms, eda and eda that differ for the presence or absence of two aminoacids. these two isoforms are members of tfn family. since the disease follows x-linked recessive transmission, only males present the full form, while heterozygous females are asymptomatic or show slight symptoms, such as hypotrichosis and reduction in the number of teeth. the genetic transmission of this disease in cattle was described by drögemüller and collaborators, who found a deletion of the whole exon of eda gene in an affected german holstein calves and proposed to use for the bovine disease the name of the homologous human syndrome. the same authors subsequently described a g/t mutation at the beginning of intron that leads to a defect in splicing and an in-frame protein deletion of or base pairs with respect to the eda and eda transcripts and a c/t snp at position of exon that causes a nonsense mutation of arginine into a stop codon. recently a new case of ectodermal dysplasia was reported in danish red holstein cattle by karlskov-mortensen and collaborators. they found a new transcript variant including an insertion of bp line fragment between exon and exon in our study we screened the eda gene in two affected calves and some of their close relatives, for a total of eight animals, in order to identify the mutations causing the disease in holstein friesian cattle breed.  cattle samples were screened for mutations through dna and rna sequence analysis. by sequencing the dna of the sampled individuals, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism g/a at the 9th base of exon. both affected calves were hemizygous a/-, the mother and the four sisters were heterozygous g/a, the healthy brother was hemizygous g/-. to verify if the mutation had effects on exon splicing we performed an analysis using human splicing finder software. the results revealed that the mutation is located within the exonic splicing enhancer recognized by sr proteins. at the rna level we performed reverse transcriptase pcr and sequencing of the cdna. in the affected calves a deletion in the amplified band of bp, shown by healthy animals, compatible in size with the skipping of the whole exon, was observed. the mother and the four sisters presented two bands of bp and bp, corresponding to those of healthy and affected individuals respectively. sequencing of the rt-pcr products revealed that the amplified fragment of the affected animals lacked exactly bp, corresponding to exon at the protein level, the exon skipping leads to a frameshift and consequently to a premature stop codon. the mutated protein is lacking in amino acids including the tfn domain. discussion the identification of mutations causing a genetic disease is of great economic importance as it allows diagnosing the healthy carriers, and then the eradication of the disease. in this study we identified a new mutation in the bovine eda gene causing ectodermal dysplasia in holstein friesian cattle breed. the g/a transversion we found in the affected calves causes a change from the glycine residue encoded by the wild type allele to a serine residue. this missense mutation changes both amino acid sequence and protein structure causing deleterious effects. several studies have shown that some missense mutations, located in exonic splicing regulatory elements, can cause diseases by altering the splicing machinery process. the mutation we identified causes the incorrect splicing of both gene isoforms. in the mutated individuals the whole exon is excluded from the final mrna sequence during the splicing process. the accurate removal of introns from pre-mrna is essential for correct gene expression. splicing is primarily regulated by splice-site motifs between intron and exon junctions. in addition to the splice-site motifs, several studies have shown that other sequences are involved in the regulation of splicing process. they form two classes of regulatory elements: exonic splicing enhancers, recognized by sr proteins, and exonic splicing silencers, recognized by hnrnp proteins. these sequences have been identified by experimental and computational approaches. in our study, the analysis of splicing revealed that the mutation is located within the exonic splicing enhancer sequences recognized by srp protein. the function of sr proteins is binding to exonic sequences and enhancing the identification of the flanking splice site. several studies have demonstrated that single point mutations in exonic splicing enhancers lead to disease development. for example, a c/t mutation in ese sequence found in the human mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coa thiolase gene results in exon skipping. the protein is no more functional causing the mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coa thiolase deficiency disorder. two silent substitutions in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex found in most patients with pdhc deficiency cause exon skipping by disruption of a putative exonic splicing enhancer. the eda protein consists of a tfn domain for binding to the receptor, a collagen domain and cutting sites for furin. the tnf domain sequence is strongly conserved between cattle, human, mouse and dog demonstrating the presence of a very important motif in this region. the mutation we discovered influences the splicing process leading to the formation of a truncated protein. in the individuals presenting the described g > a transversion, srp protein is no longer able to recognise the ese sequence resulting in skipping of exon. at the protein level, this leads to a frameshift deletion causing the loss of the tfn domain in the mutated ectodysplasin. the truncated eda protein is no longer functional thus causing the ectodermal dysplasia disease. recently a mutation that leads to a truncated eda protein was reported in danish red holstein cattle. this mutation is an insertion of a line element between exon and exon in the eda transcript, causing a frameshift which introduces a premature stop codon in the beginning of exon. our results are in agreement with the data of drögemüller et al., reporting a point mutation within the 5' splice site of intron in cattle eda gene. the mutated transcript described by those authors uses a cryptic internal splice acceptor site within exon the mutation we identified is located within the same cryptic splice site: this is a further confirmation supporting the involvement of the snp we described in the splicing process.  we identified a new single nucleotide mutation that causes ectodermal dysplasia in holstein friesian cattle breed. the analysis of this snp allows the identification of the three possible genotypes and thus can be used to highlight carrier cows that can transmit the disease to the offspring. ectodysplasia causes a significant economic loss: the use of heterozygous carriers in breeding results in a 25% chance of birth of an affected animal and 25% of birth of a carrier. therefore, the early screening for heterozygotes that are carriers of the described mutation but do not exhibit the disease would particularly useful. "," x-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a disorder characterized by abnormal development of tissues and organs of ectodermal origin caused by mutations in the eda gene. the bovine eda gene encodes the ectodysplasin a, a membrane protein expressed in keratinocytes, hair follicles and sweat glands, which is involved in the interactions between cell and cell and/or cell and matrix. four mutations causing ectodermal dysplasia in cattle have been described so far.  we identified a new single nucleotide polymorphism at the 9th base of exon in the eda gene in two calves of holstein friesian cattle breed affected by ectodermal dysplasia. this snp is located in the exonic splicing enhancer recognized by srp protein. as a consequence, the spliceosome machinery is no longer able to recognize the sequence as exonic and causes exon skipping. the mutation determines the deletion of the entire exon in the rna processing, causing a severe alteration of the protein structure and thus the disease.  we identified a mutation, never described before, that changes the regulation of alternative splicing in the eda gene and causes ectodermal dysplasia in cattle. the analysis of the snp allows the identification of carriers that can transmit the disease to the offspring. this mutation can thus be exploited for a rational and efficient selection of unequivocally healthy cows for breeding.

60," the skin with a surface area of approximately m in human beings represents the largest organ of the body and protects the latter from the intrusion of environmental substances and transepidermal water loss. however, the main skin barrier, the stratum corneum, is permeable for a small percentage of compounds with moderate oil-water partition coefficients, small molecular weights and low melting points. the stratum corneum is a complex structure comprising hydrophilic ""dry"" corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix predominantly consisting of a mixture of ceramides, cholesteryl and free fatty acids. compounds on the skin surface can pass through the stratum corneum by different ways. beside the intercellular way through the lipid matrix between the corneocytes, hair follicles and sebaceous glands are likely to be employed as diffusion shunt ways. to facilitate transdermal drug delivery for substances without permeation or to increase the amount of substance with poor permeation profiles many studies have been conducted. beside chemical permeation enhancers such as alcohols or terpenes which interact with the stratum corneum architecture or lipid composition, physical enhancers like iontophoresis, sonophoresis or microneedles have been produced to overcome the skin barrier. likewise, the formulation in which a compound is applied onto the skin determines the rate of percutaneous permeation, as thermodynamic activities e.g. can vary from formulation to formulation. although in vivo- and in vitro-studies demonstrate the vehicle dependence of the permeation profile of ibuprofen, the variety of ingredients used can barely be used to predict ibuprofen delivery out of these formulations. consequently, comparative studies with effective formulations are necessary to characterise the effectiveness of the marketed products such as creams, gels, sprays, mousses and ointments. thus, the object of the present study was to examine the in vitro permeation profile of ibuprofen out of two marketed formulations and ibuprofen solution, all of which contained 5% ibuprofen, through skin to show the impact of the vehicle on transdermal drug delivery. moreover, the ibuprofen content in the skin samples was measured to investigate whether the formulation determines the drug reservoir within the skin. methods chemicals all reagents used for the present study were of the highest purity available. the salts used for the buffer production were obtained from merck and methanol was obtained from applichem. membranes the skin was obtained from udders of holstein friesian cows at the slaughterhouse. in brief, skin flaps were removed from udders immediately after slaughter. the flaps were washed with cold water before they were stored at -20°c until use. prior to the experiment, the skin flaps were defrosted and an electrical dermatome was employed to obtain μm thick split skin samples. ibuprofen formulations the ibuprofen 5% w/w formulations utilised in the present study were ibutop® gel and ibutop® cream as well as an ibuprofen containing solution ). the ingredients of the formulations are presented in table in-vitro permeation experiments the permeation experiments were conducted in skin samples of four to six animals in duplicate under non-occlusive conditions according to oecd guideline. prior to the experiment both the skin samples were cut into pieces of cm which were incubated in pbs for minutes. they were mounted between the donor and the receptor chamber of franz-type diffusion cells, all of which were maintained at 32°c by a water bath. the receptor chambers were filled with ml sonicated pbs and stirred continuously with a magnetic bar. just before administration of the different formulations on the membrane surface a μl sample was withdrawn from the receptor chamber. additional samples were taken at the following times:, and hours. after each sample withdrawal the receptor chamber was refilled with μl pbs. ibuprofen measurement in the skin samples the amount of ibuprofen in the skin samples was determined after completion of the diffusion experiment. therefore, the skin samples were removed from the diffusion cells and rinsed with cold water. a biopsy-punch with a diameter of mm was employed to obtain a skin biopsy from the diffusion area, which was shaken with μl h2so and μl methanol for minutes. after hours incubation at 4°c the supernatant was collected and μl mcilvaine citrate buffer were added. the recovery was approximately 85-90%. analysis ibuprofen in both the receptor medium samples and the skin samples was analysed by a validated uv-vis high-performance liquid-chromatography methodology using a merck lichrocart 125- lichrospher rp18e column and a model uv-vis detector from beckman at nm. the mobile phase which was a 80: mixture of methanol and mcilvaine citrate buffer was pumped by a pump from beckman. the content of ibuprofen was determined using the external standard method. the limit of quantification was ng/ml and the limit of detection was ng/ml. the recovery results in the receptor chamber are expressed as percentage recovery of the applied amount of ibuprofen. the amount of ibuprofen found in the skin samples is expressed as ""skin absorption"" in μg/cm data analysis the plot of the cumulated amount of ibuprofen versus time was employed for the calculation of the apparent permeability coefficients according to niedorf et al. as well as for the determination of the maximum flux jmax and the lagtime. values from replicated experiments in skin from the same individual were used as average. differences in the permeation parameters were evaluated using one-way anova followed by tukey's multiple comparison test ) with a significance level of p <.  after administration of three different ibuprofen containing formulations on bovine udder skin substantial differences in the permeation profiles were obtained. the highest ibuprofen permeation was found after application of the cream formulation followed by a moderate ibuprofen permeation out of the solution and the lowest ibuprofen delivery out of the gel, despite a sharp increase of the ibuprofen permeation within the first two hours after gel administration. nevertheless, the papp-values obtained from the linear part of the plot were not significantly different between the groups. after hours significant higher ibuprofen contents were found to have been passed through the skin after topical administration of the cream by comparison to the gel and the solution. however, the highest ibuprofen reservoir in the skin samples was found in the samples treated with the solution, closely followed by the gel, while fourfold lower amounts of ibuprofen were determined in the cream treated skin samples. due to a high standard deviation, these differences were not statistically significant. significant shorter lagtimes were found after gel application in comparison to the administration of the cream or the solution. absorption parameters of bovine udder skin following application of different topical formulations containing ibuprofen 5%; n = 5- mean and standard deviation; p < discussion the present study was conducted to investigate the influence of the galenic formulation on the percutaneous permeation of ibuprofen and its storage within the skin. although the examined formulations comprised the same amount of ibuprofen, considerable differences in the permeation profiles were determined comparable with hadgraft et al.. the cream formulation was the most efficient vehicle for ibuprofen permeation through the skin as it reached twofold to threefold higher amounts of ibuprofen in the receptor chamber within hours. the permeation of the ibuprofen solution ranged between the permeation of the cream and of the gel which offered a lower ibuprofen delivery through the skin. despite a sharp initial increase in the permeation of ibuprofen out of the latter, only a small percentage of ibuprofen was delivered into the receptor fluid after application of the gel formulation over time. it has to be taken into consideration that ibuprofen represents a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is predominantly taken due to its rapid pain relief and anti-inflammatory action. thus, a high percentage of permeated ibuprofen results in the best clinical benefits. it is likely, that the application of the gel leads to a fast and effective ibuprofen concentration in the organism, whereas the data of the present in vitro study do not inform about effective plasma levels after topical administration in vivo. it has to be discussed whether the sharp incline of the ibuprofen permeation out of the gel is prejudicial to the patient compared to a steady ibuprofen permeation in the first hours after administration. since high amounts of ibuprofen were found to be in the skin after hours gel treatment, it can be supposed that, on condition that the comparatively low permeation is sufficient to produce efficacious blood levels, the gel offers advantages concerning a long-term treatment. thus, the skin supplies the body continuously with ibuprofen without the need of a follow-up treatment, even after removal of the remained formulation on the skin surface. the fact that different formulations comprising ibuprofen as active compound impact the amount of transdermal drug delivery confirms findings of hadgraft et al. and is likely to be explained by partition and diffusion phenomena. therefore, 5% ibuprofen containing formulation applied onto the skin can result in unpredictable ibuprofen fluxes, which have to be compared to effective therapeutics. furthermore, the drug reservoir within the skin is considerably determined by the galenic formulation. surprisingly, the topical application of the self-made ibuprofen solution as control resulted in a permeation rate in the middle of the marketed products, despite the lacking of supplementation of permeation enhancers like 2-propanol or medium chain triglycerides, all of which interact with the stratum corneum.  the present investigation demonstrates the importance of vehicle formulation on transdermal drug delivery of ibuprofen and highlights the differences of drug reservoirs within the skin due to different galenics.

"," the transdermal application of substances represents an elegant approach to overcome side effects related to injections or oral treatment. due to benefits like a constant plasma level, no pain during application and a simple therapeutic regime, the optimization of formulations for transdermal drug delivery has gained interest in the last decades. ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound which is nowadays often used transdermally. the objective of this work was to conduct a study on the effect of different 5% ibuprofen containing formulations on the in vitro-percutaneous permeation of ibuprofen through skin to emphasise the importance of the formulation on percutaneous permeation and skin reservoir. methods the permeation experiments were conducted in franz-type diffusion cells according to oecd guideline with mg/cm ibuprofen formulation on each skin sample. ibuprofen was analysed in the receptor fluid and extracted skin samples by uv-vis high-performance liquid-chromatography at nm. the plot of the cumulative amount of ibuprofen permeated versus time was employed to calculate the apparent permeability coefficient, the maximum flux and the lagtime, all of which were statistically analysed by one-way anova.  although ibuprofen permeation out of the gel increases rapidly within the first four hours, the cream produced the highest ibuprofen delivery through the skin within hours, followed by the solution and the gel. a significant shorter lagtime was found after gel treatment compared with the cream and the solution. after hours 59% of the applied ibuprofen was found in the receptor fluid of the cream treated samples, 26% in the solution treated samples and 21% in the samples treated with the gel. fourfold higher ibuprofen reservoirs were found in the solution and gel treated skin samples compared to the cream treated skin samples.  the present study demonstrates the importance of the formulation on transdermal drug delivery of ibuprofen and emphasises the differences of drug storage within the skin due to the formulation. thus, it is a mistaken assumption that formulations comprising the same drug amount are equivalent regarding skin permeability.

61," the ability to characterize phenotypes related to respiration is of vital importance to many areas of biomedicine ranging from pulmonary and infectious disease to drug discovery and biodefense. although such devices can be applied clinically, plethysmographs designed for small animals provides an effective means to study phenotypes that can be expensive or impossible to carry out in humans. there are several variants of plethysmographs which differ in whether the animal is wholly contained within the chamber and whether they are restrained during the measurements. for whole body plethysmographs a common parameter of interest is enhanced pause, which can be considered a measure of airway resistance. some examples of the applications of these devices include studies in asthma, sleep apnea, cystic fibrosis, respiratory viral infection after radiation injury as well as the assessment of host immune response to respiratory syncytial virus after vaccination. in order to easily analyze and share data from a large scale experiment utilizing unrestrained whole body plethysmographs we developed plethy. the plethy package is an r/sqlite based framework that enables the storage and retrieval of subsets of whole body plethysmography data for visualization and analysis. in addition, other measures that can be exported in a similar format, such as metabolic parameters, can also be utilized. implementation program design and data structures the plethy package provides an infastructure for parsing, loading and querying plethysmography data utilizing sqlite databases. currently, we provide parsing code designed to handle files exported from the finepointe software suite bundled with the buxco whole body plethysmographer. an example of such a file is given as part of the example data available at the github repository https://github.com/dbottomly/plethydata. these files are read into memory all at once or in chunks and loaded into an sqlite database. the user can control the number of lines read in at a given time. although this can be useful for limiting the memory consumption of the program at the expense of runtime, there is a limit to its benefit as the data for several entire file sections are currently held in memory at a given time. the use of sqlite provides several benefits in terms of simplicity and portability. these databases can be easily transfered amongst collaborators as stand alone files or as part of an encapsulating r package. this paradigm is one that has been utilized successfully by the bioconductor project for distributing annotations. in addition, the data contained within the database can be queried using sqlite’s own client or through drivers for most programming languages including r. the current schema for these databases is provided in additional file the resulting database can be accessed conveniently through an s object oriented interface where a buxcodb object can be created and accessed through several defined methods. a listing of the available methods is provided in additional file retrieving data for analysis is done most conveniently through the retrievedata method. this method without any arguments will retrieve all the data and return it in a data.frame. this can take a lot of memory and will be a little slower than specifying the data subsets the user is interested in. by passing in character or numeric variables as arguments to the method smaller subsets of the data can be retrieved quickly and then be used for downstream statistical or graphical analysis. the form of the data.frame is described in table description of the fields in the data.frame returned by retrievedata column description multiple files can be imported to the database by simply running the parse.buxco function again and specifying the same database path. alternatively, data.frames generated by retrievedata can be used to create a new database or be merged in with an existing plethy database using the dbimport method. this allows plethy to be extensible enough to be used in a collaborative multi-lab setting where data sharing is essential. parsing and data retrieval is demonstrated in additional file  dataset as a demonstration of the plethy package we used a plethysmography dataset derived from the longitudinal assessment of c57bl/6j mice after influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or mock infection. this dataset is available as an r package at https://github.com/dbottomly/plethydata. demonstration of these features and reproduction of the tables and figures is shown in additional file and additional file as is described in the ‘parsing’ section of additional file the plethysmography files we work with are large and structured. previously sections of these files would be loaded and manipulated in excel by investigators, a process which was both tedious and error prone. the plethy package simplifies this process and enables efficient exploration and analysis of the data with only a handful of r functions. assuming the data has been loaded into a database and a buxcodb object exists, we can first perform qa/qc of the data followed by exploratory data analysis and model fitting. quality control currently our quality control procedures are centered around finding deviations from the expected number and duration of the measurements. for example, the expectation is that the flu, sars and mock infected animals were first allowed an acclimation period of minutes in the chamber followed by minutes of experimental readings. as shown in additional file these data can be labeled with their inferred run type and these labels can then be checked for similarity to the experimental design. if deviations are detected, the data can be re-labeled, keeping the old labels for provenance. the plethy package comes with procedures to provide basic checks of the measurement timestamps. one such check is performed internally while parsing and loading the data. this check emits a warning if observed experimental time intervals are greater than a specified tolerance. similarly, the exact timepoint of an experiment can be computed from the measurement timestamps which are captured in the sqlite database. this enables automatic checking of the labeled experimental timepoint. in the case of the sars, flu and mock data, no such anomalies exist but we provide a simulated dataset where they do in the ‘quality control’ section in additional file these data can then be visualized using several built in methods as well as other visualization functionality in r. visualization visualization is key for plethysmography data as many measurements can be produced for each animal for each time point. this results in a very rich multivariate experimental dataset which is also potentially longitudinal in nature. as our main use case is the change in respiration measurements over time, we provide two key plotting methods for longitudinal data: tsplot and mvtsplot. arguably the most common way to visualize longitudinal data is using a simple line plot of the mean response per each animal and time point as is shown in figure for the penh phenotype which can be produced using the tsplot method. additionally, the mvtsplot method produces an adaptation of the multivariate time series plot which combines a heatmap with boxplot-like summaries and a basic line plot to provide a detailed overview of a given experiment. note that as is shown in both figures and one of the sars samples appears to be anomalous compared to the others in terms of its penh measurements and bears a greater similarity to the mock samples. interface to modeling utilities the simplest approach to analyzing longitudinal data is to summarize the data as a single value for each animal and then perform a t-test or analysis of variance, termed a ‘summary measures’ analysis. we provide a summarymeasures method which can compute a wide variety of summaries for each curve as demonstrated for animal ‘907_b_f’ below in table also as mentioned above, retrievedata can provide the user with a data.frame and similarly data can also be returned in matrix form using the retrievematrix method. importantly, either data.frames or matrices can serve as the input to almost all modelling functions in r. for example, we may be interested in assessing the effect of time and infection status on penh values. as shown in figures and the penh response over time is non-linear showing a peak around day for flu and for sars followed by a decline to roughly the level shown by the mock infected animals. an initial model for this might involve infection status and polynomial terms for time. any such model should also account for the presence of many technical measurements for each sample. for the example code below we make the initial assumption that samples will differ only in terms of the intercept. assuming bux.db refers to a buxcodb object we can fit a cursory mixed effects model as:summary measures for animal ‘907_b_f’ for several buxco whole body plethysmography phenotypes variable_name time_to_max max auc mean as the goal of this section of the manuscript is only to highlight how plethy could be used in conjunction with other r packages we make no claims as to the efficacy of this particular model for a given analysis. as another example of utilizing the data retrieval functions to simplify analysis we can also perform classification. if more samples were accrued, we may also be interested in predicting flu, sars and mock status given measurements from mutliple plethysmography outputs. one approach to this could be the use of linear discriminant analysis. this could be carried out as below by first summarizing each sample by the mean phenotype for a given informative day, say day and running a procedure similar to below to train our model: the predictions and assements of this model could then be carried out using utilities provided in one of many r packages.  our software provides a convenient framework for storage and retrieval of whole body plethysmography data in r. currently we support import of data from the finepointe software of buxco, however the basic framework is amendable to data produced from other vendors. as the software is open source, such support can be requested via the bioconductor mailing list or contributed via the github site for the project. r in conjunction with sqlite allows efficient exploration and summarization of the data. future releases of plethy will include additional built-in plotting and summarization tools. availability and requirements project name: plethyproject home

"," characterization of respiratory phenotypes can enhance complex trait and genomic studies involving allergic/autoimmune and infectious diseases. many aspects of respiration can be measured using devices known as plethysmographs that can measure thoracic movement. one such approach performs unrestrained whole body plethysmography on mice which infers thoracic movements from pressure differences from the act of inhalation and exhalation. while proprietary software is available to perform basic statistical analysis as part of machine’s bundled software, it is desirable to be able to incorporate these analyses into high-throughput pipelines and integrate them with other data types, as well as leverage the wealth of analytic and visualization approaches provided by the r statistical computing environment.  this manuscript describes the plethy package which is an r/bioconductor framework for pre-processing and analysis of plethysmography data with emphasis on larger scale longitudinal experiments. the plethy package was designed to facilitate quality control and exploratory data analysis. we provide a demonstration of the features of plethy using a dataset assessing the respiratory effects over time of sars and influenza infection in mice.  the plethy package provides functionality for users to import, perform quality assessment and exploratory data analysis in a manner that allows interoperability with existing modelling tools. our package is implemented in r and is freely available as part of the bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/plethy.html. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords plethysmographyrespirationmouserissue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",7c8f3ee5-03cf-4be8-af04-13bae111d94f,pubmed
62," escherichia coli have been widely used as a host to produce valuable commercial, industrial, and therapeutic proteins. there are several disadvantages with this system, however, especially for the expression of eukaryotic proteins. for example, when randomly selected full-length genes of caenorhabditis elegans were expressed in e. coli cytoplasm, only 11% of genes yielded significant amounts of soluble material. several different approaches have been taken to resolve the solubility problem in the past and include truncation of long multi-domain proteins into short and separate domains; co-expression of molecular chaperones or foldases; enabled secretion to the periplasm where disulfide bonds can be properly formed with the help of an oxidative environment and dsb protein families; co-expression of aminoacyl trna cognates to amino acids encoded by rare codons; and more recently use of a fusion expression partner. the most efficient method for enhancing solubility and folding efficiencies of recombinant proteins appears to be the latter which includes maltose binding protein, thioredoxin, human ferritin heavy chains, and glutathione-s-transferase. although these fusion partners have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility and folding of some recombinant proteins, they likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining. in the present study, we found that the level of rpos significantly increased during the stress caused by guanidine hydrochloride through proteome-wide mining involving the stress response of e. coli bl as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, rpos dramatically increased the solubility of the following heterologous proteins, human epidermal growth factor, human prepro-ghrelin, human interleukin-, human activation induced cytidine deaminase, human glutamate decarboxylase, pseudomonas putida cutinase, human ferritin light chain, human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and cold autoinflammatory syndrome nacht domain ). we also have demonstrated an increased yield of a biologically active fusion mutant of heterologous bacterial cutinase that is expected to be of significant biotechnical and commercial interest.  guanidine hydrochloride-induced proteome response of e. coli and finding of the aggregation-resistant protein, rpos exogenous stresses including heat shock and gdnhcl often results in the misfolding and aggregation of proteins within the cell. therefore, it would seem reasonable to presume that intracellular proteins which exist in their native soluble forms even under stress conditions have an intrinsic ability to remain efficiently folded compared to proteins that unfold or aggregate under the same stresses. gdnhcl stress facilitates the release of periplasmic proteins through increased membrane permeability and hence could be regarded as an osmolyte. we investigated changes of the proteome profile of e. coli when the stress reagent, guanidine hydrochloride, was added to growing bacterial cultures, by applying 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. compared to non-stress condition, the total number of intracellular soluble proteins was reduced to from which indicates that many proteins aggregated under the stress condition induced by gdnhcl. what was surprising is that the rpos expression level increased 6-fold compared to the non-stress situation. in addition to rpos, we found several other proteins, the expression level of which more than -fold increased in response to the stressor gdnhcl, including hsp chaperonin, chaperone htpg, transcription elongation protein nusa, dna gyrase subunit a, formate acetyltransferase, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit, etc. since the synthesis yield of target protein can be significantly reduced, the molecular mass of proteins to be used as fusion expression partner should not be too high. that is, although the large amount of fusion protein is synthesized, the actual amount of the target fusion-free protein could be very low if the fusion partner is too big. rpos is a relatively small protein among the stress-responsive proteins we found and was highly effective in enhancing the solubility of target proteins. rpos, stress responsive rna polymerase sigma factor is a well-known universal stress regulator controlling many proteins under various stress conditions, e.g. the onset of the stationary phase, and carbon starvation. rpos was previously reported to be induced by osmotic stress and heat shock. we also observed that the rpos expression level increased 3- to 5-fold in response to heat shock. muffler et al. reported that the duration of stability of rpos in response to heat shock stress is maintained by the direct- or indirect-binding of dnak. bound dnak appears to assist the effective folding of rpos and also protect rpos against the action of clpp, a protease that degrades rpos. from this point of view, rpos may serve as a solubility enhancer in e. coli cytoplasm, when used as a fusion expression partner upon the expression of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins. a gene name, accession number, and protein name were obtained from expasy proteomics server. b theoretical values of pi and mw were calculated using ""compute pi/mw tool"". c experimental values of pi and mw were estimated through 2-de gel image analysis in the present study. d sequence coverage and score values were calculated using ""aldente: peptide mass fingerprinting tool"". expression of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins using rpos as fusion partner we used rpos as an n-terminus fusion expression partner for the synthesis of numerous heterologous proteins. stenström et al. reported that the codon following an aug start triplet significantly affects gene expression in e. coli, and the second codon starting with a is most advantageous to achieve an enhanced expression level. the second codon of rpos is agt that seems to be favorable second codon based on the report of stenström et al.. as shown in figure 3b and table all heterologous proteins expressed directly without rpos fusion formed insoluble inclusion bodies resulting in nearly negligible solubility. compared to these results, it seems surprising that when the same heterologous proteins were expressed with the fusion of rpos, the solubility of these foreign proteins dramatically increased, thereby indicating that e. coli rpos is a highly effective solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins. table compares the effect of rpos- and gst fusion on the solubility enhancement for heterologous proteins. in the fusion expression of cut, gad448– and mpins, the effect of rpos fusion was much higher, whereas gst fusion was significantly more effective in the expression of aid, nacht, and hftn-l. this result indicates that there are no universal helpers to solve all protein solubility issues. table also shows that the results of direct- and fusion expression of heterologous proteins are highly reproducible. * the solubility was defined as the fraction of the soluble recombinant protein compared to the synthesized total recombinant protein. average and standard deviation values were calculated based on the results of repeated triplicate experiments. moreover, the plasmid vector for the expression of polyhistidine-tagged fusion mutant of g-csf was constructed to purify fusion-free g-csf. after 6::rpos::::g-csf was bound onto the probond resin column, the enterokinase proteolysis was carried out in a batch mode, and subsequently the digested product was collected and centrifuged. sds-page and western blot analyses of the supernatant show that the recombinant g-csf was easily released from the rpos-fusion protein and was present in the form of soluble protein in the supernatant. bioactivity of the recombinant fusion mutant of cutinase, rpos::cut cutinase has been used as a lipolytic enzyme in the composition of laundry and dishwashing detergents to more efficiently remove immobilized fats. in addition, the oleochemistry industries, and pollutant degradation represent other potential uses of cutinase. in recent years, the esterification and transesterification properties of cutinase have been intensively exploited and could be applied usefully in other chemical synthesis processes. because of these extensive potential applications, we were particularly interested in the production of a bioactive recombinant cutinase. thus, we cloned the cutinase gene from the genome of pseudomonas putida and expressed it in e. coli using the fusion of rpos. cutinase is known for its hydrolytic activity for a variety of esters ranging from soluble p-nitrophenyl esters to insoluble long-chain triglycerides. the hydrolytic activity of cutinase, especially on p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids, is extremely sensitive to fatty acid chain length. previously, lin et al. reported that microbial cutinase lacked a large hydrophobic surface around the active site, in contrast to other lipases and esterases. this structural characteristic of cutinase may be strongly related to high substrate-specificity, i.e. the extremely low activity on p-nitrophenyl ester of a long chain fatty acid such as p-nitrophenyl palmitate. we assayed the enzymatic activity of our fusion mutant of cutinase and demonstrated the same selective bioactivity as native cutinase to degrade p-nitrophenyl butyrate but not to degrade pnp. we also purified rpos::cut-his through ni2+ affinity chromatography and analyzed the purified rpos::cut-his using reversed phase hplc. as shown in figure 6b, rpos::cut-his was analyzed as a single peak, which seems to indicate that the crafted mutant molecules of cutinase have uniform and correctly folded conformation due probably to the help of fusion partner, e. coli rpos.  using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we found that e. coli rpos, rna polymerase sigma factor was gdnhcl stress-responsive and highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer when used as fusion partner for the expression of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli bl the results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase. "," the most efficient method for enhancing solubility of recombinant proteins appears to use the fusion expression partners. although commercial fusion partners including maltose binding protein and glutathione-s-transferase have shown good performance in enhancing the solubility, they cannot be used for the proprietory production of commercially value-added proteins and likely cannot serve as universal helpers to solve all protein solubility and folding issues. thus, novel fusion partners will continue to be developed through systematic investigations including proteome mining presented in this study.  we analyzed the escherichia coli proteome response to the exogenous stress of guanidine hydrochloride using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and found that rpos was significantly stress responsive. while under the stress condition the total number of soluble proteins decreased by about %, but a 6-fold increase in the level of rpos was observed, indicating that rpos is a stress-induced protein. as an n-terminus fusion expression partner, rpos increased significantly the solubility of many aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in e. coli cytoplasm, indicating that rpos is a very effective solubility enhancer for the synthesis of many recombinant proteins. rpos was also well suited for the production of a biologically active fusion mutant of pseudomonas putida cutinase.  rpos is highly effective as a strong solubility enhancer for aggregation-prone heterologous proteins when it is used as a fusion expression partner in an e. coli expression system. the results of these findings may, therefore, be useful in the production of other biologically active industrial enzymes, as successfully demonstrated by cutinase.

63," microarray techniques have revolutionized genomic research by making it possible to monitor the expression of thousands of genes in parallel. due to the amount of data being produced by this technology, gene reduction is extremely important because: it generally reduces the computational cost of machine learning techniques, it usually increases the accuracy of classification algorithms and it provides clues to researches about genes that are important in a given context. related with this domain, the area of gene identification has been previously addressed by furman et al. through the utilization of information theory. several methods have been proposed to reduce dimensions in the microarray data domain. these works include the application of genetic algorithms, wrapper approaches, support vector machines, spectral biclustering, etc. other approaches focus their attention on redundancy reduction and feature extraction, as well as the identification of similar gene classes making prototypes-genes. in addition, there are also several packages implemented in r for feature selection as iterativebma, varselrf or r-svm. iterativebma is a bioconductor r package which performs multivariate feature selection for multiclass microarray data and it is based on the bayesian model averaging approach. the varselrf package implements a method for gene selection based on the measures of variable importance which return the random forest algorithm and it is also suitable for multivariate and multiclass datasets. the r-svm method is similar to the varselrf in the sense that it uses the relative importance of features in svm classifiers to select relevant genes but it is only applicable to binary classifications. finally, it is also considered the ttest function of the genefilter package which implements the conventional t-test method for feature selection. table shows a comparative analysis of these r-based methods and the proposed dfp algorithm. the r package is available from bioconductor the r package is available from cran and its implementation takes advantage of computing clusters and multicore processors the genefilter package is available from bioconductor it is sensitive against outliers which are frequent in microarray data it accounts for the noise in the data because, as a fuzzy-based method, it deals with linguistic categories instead of raw data the implementation is computationally efficient and available from bioconductor in this context, there are many advantages of applying fuzzy logic to the analysis of gene expression data: fuzzy logic inherently accounts for noise in the data because it extracts trends, not crisp values; in contrast to other automated decision making techniques, algorithms in fuzzy logic are cast in the same language used in day-to-day conversation, so conclusions are easily interpretable and can be extrapolated; fuzzy logic techniques are computationally efficient and can be scaled to include a high number of components. based on these assumptions, the aim in writing dfp was to provide a simple-to-use library to perform gene selection and data reduction by the application of a supervised fuzzy pattern algorithm able to discretize and filter existing gene expression profiles. implementation dfp is an extension package for the programming language and statistical environment r. the software has been developed to perform fuzzy analysis and gene reduction using microarray data. it employs object classes and functions that are also standard in other packages of the bioconductor project. the whole algorithm comprises of three main steps. first, it represents each gene value in terms of one from the following linguistic labels: low, medium, high and their intersections lowmedium and mediumhigh. the output is a fuzzy microarray descriptor for each existing sample containing the discretized gene expression values. the second phase aims to find all genes that best explain each class, constructing a supervised fuzzy pattern for each class. starting from the previous generated fuzzy patterns, the package is able to discriminate those genes that can provide a substantial discernibility between existing classes, generating an unique discriminant fuzzy pattern. discretizing microarray data using fuzzy labels in the first step, given a set of n expressed sequence tags or genes belonging to m microarrays, the discretization process is based on determining the membership function of each gene to the previously linguistic labels. in this package, two types of membership functions are used. firstly, a polynomial approximation of a gaussian membership function which achieve smoothness for the degree of membership of'normal' expression levels of a gene, and secondly, a polynomial approximation of two sigmoidal membership functions which are able to specify asymmetric membership functions for the'low' and'high' expression levels. the algorithm defines a threshold value θ, which need to be established in order to discretize the original data in a binary way. for concrete values of threshold θ, specific zones of the gene values domain for which none of the labels will be activated can exist. this fact must be interpreted as the specific value of the gene is not enough to assign it a significant linguistic label at the significance degree of membership fixed by threshold θ. on the other hand, one expression level can simultaneously activate two linguistic labels, since at the significance level given by θ, any assignment of the measure to a linguistic label is significant. assembling a supervised fuzzy pattern of representative genes a fuzzy pattern is a higher concept built from a set of fmds belonging to the same class, and it can be viewed as a prototype of them. the fp corresponding to a given class is constructed by selecting the genes with a label which has a relative frequency of appearance equal to or greater than a predefined ratio π. therefore, the fp captures relevant and common information about the discretized gene expression levels of the fmds that summarizes. the predefined ratio π controls the degree of exigency for selecting a gene as a member of the pattern, since the higher the value of π, the fewer the number of genes which make up the fp. the pattern's quality of fuzziness is given by the fact that the labels, which make it up, come from the linguistic labels defined during the transformation into fmd of an initial observation. moreover, if a specific label of a gene is very common in all the examples belonging to a given class, this feature will be selected to be included in the fp. therefore, a frequency-based criterion is used for selecting a gene as part of the fuzzy pattern. recognizing valuable genes the goal of gene selection is to determine a reduced set of genes, which are meaningful given the existing knowledge. here, the algorithm introduces the notion of discriminant fuzzy pattern with regard to a collection of fps. a dfp version of a fp only includes those genes that can serve to differentiate it from the rest of the patterns. therefore, the computed dfp for a specific fp is different depending on what other fps are compared with it. it's not surprising that the genes used to discern a specific class from others will be different if the set of rival classes also changes. the pseudo code algorithm used to compute the final dfp containing the selected genes can be consulted in additional file 2:dfppseudocode.pdf.  the package dfp has been designated for performing fuzzy analysis and gene reduction from a set of microarray experiments. dfp, like any r package, is command-line driven. the functions are called by the user, possibly with arguments and options. any session using dfp in r starts with the command library which makes the functions of dfp available in the r environment. a very quick start example could be carried out using the artificial data set rmadataset, included in the package data once the data is loaded, the whole algorithm can be executed calling its main function discriminantfuzzypattern which will work out with the default parameter values, or step by step as in the following example mfs<-calculatemembershipfunctions +                               which calculates the membership functions for each gene. these functions can be displayed using the following command plotmembershipfunctions +          dfp can now convert gene expression values into linguistic labels. a gene will have an assigned linguistic label if its expression level exceeds the significance degree of membership fixed by threshold zeta. it is done by the command dvs<-discretizeexpressionvalues +               showing part of the results with the following function showdriscretevalues +                   , +                               c)) the next step involves the generation of a fuzzy pattern that summarizes the most relevant genes of each category. a gene will belong to a fp if its assigned label is present with a frequency higher than pival. it is done by the command fps<-calculatefuzzypatterns +                showing part of the results with the following function showfuzzypatterns the last step calculates the discriminant fuzzy pattern by including those genes present in two or more fuzzy patterns with different assigned labels. the following command performs this operation dfps<-calculatediscriminantfuzzypattern the selected genes can now be shown in both text and graphical mode using the function plotdiscriminantfuzzypattern  dfp is a new bioconductor r package that performs gene selection and data reduction by the application of a supervised fuzzy pattern algorithm. as other bioconductor/r packages, dfp offers a high level of standardized documentation through its vignette and the function help pages. the implemented algorithm has also been coded and tested in genecbr, a multiplatform open source tool for microarray analysis. the results obtained using publicly available data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. availability and requirements

using dna microarray technology generate enormous data sets that are not amenable to simple analysis. the greatest challenge in maximizing the use of this huge amount of data is to develop algorithms to interpret and interconnect results from different genes under different conditions. in this context, fuzzy logic can provide a systematic and unbiased way to both find biologically significant insights relating to meaningful genes, thereby removing the need for expert knowledge in preliminary steps of microarray data analyses and reduce the cost and complexity of later applied machine learning techniques being able to achieve interpretable models.  dfp is a new bioconductor r package that implements a method for discretizing and selecting differentially expressed genes based on the application of fuzzy logic. dfp takes advantage of fuzzy membership functions to assign linguistic labels to gene expression levels. the technique builds a reduced set of relevant genes able to summarize and represent each underlying class. a last step constructs a biased set of genes by intersecting existing fuzzy patterns in order to detect discriminative elements. in addition, the software provides new functions and visualisation tools that summarize achieved results and aid in the interpretation of differentially expressed genes from multiple microarray experiments.  dfp integrates with other packages of the bioconductor project, uses common data structures and is accompanied by ample documentation. it has the advantage that its parameters are highly configurable, facilitating the discovery of biologically relevant connections between sets of genes belonging to different pathologies. this information makes it possible to automatically filter irrelevant genes thereby reducing the large volume of data supplied by microarray experiments. based on these contributions genecbr, a successful tool for cancer diagnosis using microarray datasets, has recently been released.

64," the chromosomal band 17q contains a common inversion polymorphism linked with neurodegenerative diseases including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, parkinson’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease. this inversion of approximately 900 kb is mostly present in populations with european ancestry. this region contains a number of genes, including corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor and microtubule-associated protein tau. two divergent mapt haplotypes, h and h are described with distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns across the region reflecting the inversion status at this locus. the h haplotype is inverted and is relatively common in europeans, however, almost absent in african and asian populations. this configuration is associated with fecundity and appears to be under positive selection in european populations. specific h haplotypes are associated with the neurodegenerative disorders, whereas the h haplotype is linked to recurrent deletion events resulting in the 17q microdeletion syndrome, characterized by developmental delay and learning disability. the h haplotype is linked with an increased expression of mapt, resulting in overproduction and aggregation of hyperphosphorylated protein tau in neuronal cell bodies, which is linked to disease pathology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. however, little is known about the regulation of expression levels of other genes in the region. in this study we used single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data to reconstruct inversion haplotypes in the chromosome 17q region and studied the effect of the inversion status on gene expression of all known genes in the region in whole blood and different regions of the human brain.  regulation of expression in whole blood a principal component analysis was applied to snps in the,001-, region on chromosome the first principal component represents the 17q inversion genotypes homozygous h heterozygous h1/h and homozygous h2/h of the individuals, were excluded because of ambiguity in master genotype call. this resulted in three distinct clusters of individuals, representing h1/h, h1/h and h2/h genotypes, depicted in figure for of the genes in the region, gene expression probes were available in the blood dataset. a linear regression analysis showed a positive association of lrrc37a with the number of h alleles. in contrast, mgc was negatively associated with the h1/h genotype results are given in table we did not detect expression of the mapt gene in blood. the genes found to be associated to the 17q inversion haplotypes are listed in the first column with their corresponding probe ids. the genes have been tested in two datasets and results of linear regression are given, t, b and p-values. the b values indicate the actual change in expression associated with each copy of the h allele. the corresponding unadjusted p-values are listed when significant. not all genes were available or detected in each dataset; n/a = not available on array, dt = did not meet detection threshold in tissue, ns = not significant. all probes for the genes in the 17q region are listed in additional file 1: table s regulation of expression in human brain we consulted a publically available human brain expression dataset consisting of frontal cortex, temporal cortex, cerebellum and pons of individuals. master genotypes of the chromosome 17q inversion were reconstructed using pc values of snps in the,001-, interval. this resulted in three distinct clusters of individuals, representing h1/h, h1/h and h2/h genotypes. for of the genes in the inversion region, expression probes were available in every brain area. a linear regression analysis of allele dosage was performed for each brain area separately. in line with literature, we found a higher expression of mapt to be associated with the h1/h genotype in frontal cortex and cerebellum. in addition, the h1/h genotype was also associated with increased expression of plekhm in cerebellum. in contrast, lower expression of crhr was associated with this genotype in cerebellum, while undetected in the other brain regions. finally, decreased expression of lrrc37a was found to be associated with the h1/h genotype in frontal cortex, temporal cortex and pons. no polymorphic snps were detected in the probe sequence that could have confounded the hybridization signal. when aligning the lrrc37a probe sequence to refseq rna sequences, it was found that this probe aligns significantly with not only lrrc37a, but also lrrc37a, lrrc37a and lrrc37a. therefore, the strong association can be the result of non-specific binding to more than one target gene in this gene family. alignment of all other significant probes sequences, including lrrc37a did not suggest non-specific binding. discussion the chromosome 17q inversion of the mapt locus represents one of the most structurally complex and evolutionarily dynamic regions of the genome. the distinct clades of haplotypes represent the direct and inverted orientation of the inversion, each with different functional impacts. specific h haplotypes are associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy and parkinson’s disease, whereas the h haplotype is associated with recurrent microdeletions resulting in the 17q microdeletion syndrome. neurodegenerative diseases associated with the h haplotype exhibit aggregation of hyperphosphorylated protein tau in neuronal cell bodies. gene expression differences have been described for mapt, but there has been no systematic approach to study the effect of inversion status on expression of the other genes at this locus. we used principal component analysis to identify inversion haplotypes at chromosome 17q, and observed that the effect of inversion status is not limited to mapt expression levels, but also affects several other genes in the 17q region. in line with literature, we found increased expression of mapt to be associated with the number of h alleles in brain. however, we only observed this in frontal cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that regulation of this gene may differ between brain regions. a previous study identified a specific sequence variant in mapt in the 17q region on the h haplotype regulating the expression of mapt in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. in this study we focused on the effect of the entire inversion on gene expression with use of a robust principal component analysis strategy. genotype data of this particular snp was available in the brain dataset but was not significantly associated with gene expression values. importantly, we observed that genes other than mapt are functionally regulated by the inversion haplotypes as well and may therefore be of importance in diseases associated with the inversion region. the expression of crhr is significantly decreased in the h1/h haplotype and that of plekhm member 1) increased. these associations were found in cerebellum only. the plekhm gene is involved in osteopertrosis by affecting vesicular transport and therefore osteoclast-osteoblast cross-talk. currently there is no functional data available on mgc that was found to be differentially expressed due to inversion status in whole blood. mgc consists of exons of which are shared with the long isoform of crhr. it is therefore possible that these are different splice forms of a single gene, which would suggest that the concurrent association findings with inversion status represent a single event. the fact that directionality of mgc expression in blood and crhr expression in cerebellum is the same in this study supports this view. the crhr gene is a critical part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that mediates stress response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders. of the two receptors in this system, overactivity of crhr in anxiety and depression has been a consistent finding in animal studies. in human, there is evidence for an interaction of crhr function and stressful life events on vulnerability to depression and alcoholism through regulation of hpa-axis and possibly additional interaction with serotonin transporter loci. in addition, multiple sclerosis has been associated to hpa-axis activity, specifically genetic variants in crhr. we find increased expression of crhr associated with h configuration, suggesting that crhr activity and/or stress response might also be altered in or contributing to the h related phenotypes such as developmental delay and learning disability. there is no functional data available for leucine rich repeat containing member a expressed in whole blood and lrrc37a expressed in brain. for both genes we observed a significant association with inversion status, however, with opposite effects. it is important to note that the lrrc gene family is located at either inversion breakpoints and is therefore likely to be affected by copy number variation that are associated with 17q inversion status. of the lrrc family, member a in particular has been shown to be most variable in copy number. for these reasons, the association between inversion status and gene expression levels of these genes could be entirely due to differences in copy number linked to h and h haplotypes. a recent study finds a strong association between germline hypomethylation and genomic instability, describing that dna methylation deserts are highly enriched for structural rearrangements. the authors report that rare cnvs that are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders are significantly linked with local hypomethylation. in fact, germline hypomethylation seems to play a more important role in chromosomal rearrangement than the presence of segmental duplications. future studies should address whether inversion status of the 17q region can be linked to changes in epigenetic tags.  in conclusion, our results indicate that the chromosome 17q inversion polymorphism associated with several neurodegenerative disorders affects the expression of multiple genes besides mapt in a tissue-specific manner. it is therefore likely that these other genes may also play a role in pathophysiology of these neurodegenerative disorders. "," chromosome 17q contains a common inversion polymorphism of approximately 900 kb in populations with european ancestry. two divergent mapt haplotypes, h and h are described with distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns across the region reflecting the inversion status at this locus. the mapt h haplotype has been associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, parkinson’s disease and alzheimer’s disease, while the h is linked to recurrent deletion events associated with the 17q microdeletion syndrome, a disease characterized by developmental delay and learning disability.  in this study, we investigate the effect of the inversion on the expression of genes in the 17q region. we find the expression of several genes in and at the borders of the inversion to be affected; specific either to whole blood or different regions of the human brain. the h haplotype was found to be associated with an increased expression of lrrc37a plekh1m and mapt. in contrast, a decreased expression of mgc lrrc37a and crhr was associated with h  studies thus far have focused on the expression of mapt in the inversion region. however, our results show that the inversion status affects expression of other genes in the 17q region as well. given the link between the inversion status and different neurological diseases, these genes may also be involved in disease pathology, possibly in a tissue-specific manner.

65," the isolation of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms from clinical specimens collected from suspected patients serves as the gold standard for the proper diagnosis of tuberculosis in the laboratory. however, false-positive cultures have been reported that result from the cross-contamination of specimens via a contaminated bronchoscope or, more often, by laboratory cross-contamination. the latter situation has been reported at a frequency ranging from % to 3% of m. tuberculosis. laboratory cross-contamination should be suspected when m. tuberculosis is cultured from a smear-negative specimen processed in the same batch as a culture from a smear-positive specimen. the factors that increase the likelihood of cross-contamination include instances when only one of several specimens from the same patient is culture-positive and instances when the clinician is considering a diagnosis other than tuberculosis, which the clinician believes to be more likely based on clinical observations. such false-positives resulting from cross-contaminated specimens are disadvantageous since, besides resulting in a misdiagnosis, they result in unnecessary treatment and delay further diagnostic investigations in an effort to derive a definitive and correct diagnosis. finally, these false-positive cultures lead to an overestimation of the incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis in humans. a definitive demonstration of cross-contamination can be derived from precise molecular analyses of m. tuberculosis isolates. m. tuberculosis isolates harbouring identical genotypes are regarded as clones and are thus epidemiologically linked. the most widely used technique for determining the genotype of m. tuberculosis is a technique known as is6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. rflp analysis requires a large amount of biological material and, thus, poses a risk to laboratory workers due to the harmful nature of this pathogen. moreover, the latter method requires a substantial amount of time due to the fastidious nature of m. tuberculosis. more importantly from, a strictly technical perspective, is6110-rflp analysis does a poor job of indicating the presence of m. tuberculosis when these organisms contain only a few copies of the is sequence. recently, the variable number tandem repeat pcr-based technique and the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit technique have proven to be reliable methods for the resolution of cross-contamination events. we herein report the application of a new pcr-sequencing-based genotyping method, known as multispacer sequence typing, for determining whether specimens have been cross-contaminated with m. tuberculosis in the laboratory. case report a 60-year-old man was admitted for an examination to determine whether he had interstitial pneumonia. the patient had been previously hospitalised for two weeks at a different location with symptoms that included shortness of breath, a fever of °c, and a kg loss of weight within the past month. at the aforementioned hospital, a chest radiograph indicated the presence of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. subsequent microbiological investigations, including ziehl-neelsen staining and a pcr-based assay to test for the presence of m. tuberculosis on expectoration, indicated that there were no signs of such an infection. the patient was then transferred to our department for further evaluation. clinical examination of the patient verified both a body temperature of – °c and dyspnoea with 90% oxygen saturation under l/min oxygen. the medical history of the patient was unremarkable, except for previous treatment for arterial hypertension. the total body tomodensitometry indicated the presence of nodules in both lungs, in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and in a right axilar lymph node. the pertinent laboratory assays were performed and indicated a value of leucocytes/ml with 76% polymorphonuclear cells and platelets/ml. the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined to be mm for the first hour. the lactate dehydrogenase level was iu/ml, the gamma gt level was iu/ml, the bilirubin concentration was μmol/l, the ast level was iu/l, and the alt level was shown to be iu/l. it was suspected that the patient had already begun to develop pulmonary tuberculosis and thus was recommended to receive anti-tuberculosis therapy since it was reported that m. tuberculosis was isolated from an expectoration that was collected days prior during the first hospital visit. due to the observation that the patient's respiratory status had worsened, the patient was admitted into an intensive care unit for a period of four days. the results of direct microscopic examinations using gram and ziehl-neelsen staining of a surgical lung biopsy were negative. this sample, cultured in bactec and in 5% blood agar in slant tubes, remained sterile after a two-month incubation period. subsequent histological examination discovered large b-cell lymphoma and further assessments confirmed that the patient had stage iv lymphoma that involved the lung, liver, and bone marrow. the patient then received the appropriate anti-lymphoma therapy.  our investigation revealed isolation of a total of six m. tuberculosis strains from a laboratory that performed analyses for six different patients within a 2-week period before and after the isolation of m. tuberculosis from the index patient. all isolates were recovered from respiratory tract specimens and identified as m. tuberculosis by phenotypic methods and the etr-d sequencing method. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on april 27th, while isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received on may 3rd, but handled for setting in culture on may 4th. isolate tub was recovered from a specimen received and handled on may 4th, while isolates tub tub and tub were recovered from specimens received and handled on may 8th. ziehl-neelsen staining was performed on all six specimens and the subsequent analyses revealed the presence of acid-fast bacilli for all samples with the exception of the specimen collected from index patient c, which exhibited no acid-fast bacillus. epidemiological investigation indicated that patients a, d, and e resided in the same ward, whereas no epidemiological link was found between the other three patients, including index patient c. eight intergenic spacers were pcr amplified for each of the six m. tuberculosis isolates and yielded pcr products of the expected sizes. sequences derived from these pcr products were combined and assembled for each of the six isolates. mst analysis was completed within four working days. analysis of the sequence combinations determined three new genetic profiles, including profile st which characterized the three isolates derived from patients a, d, and e; profile st which characterized the two isolates derived from patient b and the index patient c; and profile st which was discovered in the isolate derived from patient f. these new profiles resulted from a novel combination of the following spacer alleles: the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 2/mst 1/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst13; the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 2/mst 2/mst 1/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst13; and the st profile combined alleles 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 1/mst 3/mst 3/mst 4/mst and allele 4/mst the profiles for st st and st have been added to our free and accessible mst database http://ifr timone.univ-mrs.fr/mst_mtuberculosis/mst. mst genotyping data were assumed to be authentic based on the observations that the pcr-negative controls remained negative, coupled with the observation that all pcr products were of the predicted size. moreover, analysis of the spacer sequences edited in this work identified three new profiles, clearly indicating that amplicons did not result from laboratory contamination as a consequence of previous experiments. the mst genotyping data provided evidence to support epidemiological and clinical data that confirmed laboratory cross-contamination. specifically, one profile comprised three isolates recovered from epidemiologically-linked patients, whereas a different profile characterized only one isolate from a specimen collected from an unrelated patient f. the profile st was discovered for two m. tuberculosis isolates obtained from the index patient c and one unrelated patient b. microscopic examination of a respiratory tract specimen collected from patient b indicated the presence of acid-fast bacilli, while the same analysis performed for a specimen from the respiratory tract of the index patient c showed no indication of acid-fast bacilli. both of the latter two specimens were handled in the same laboratory, on the same day, and within the same batch of sample preparations, which explains the observation that the specimen recovered from the index patient was contaminated by the specimen collected from patient b. such a situation has been previously observed in cases of laboratory cross-contamination. interestingly, the frequency of false-positive cultures has been shown to be higher for laboratories that do not process high numbers of specimens, as was the case in the present report. as an example, in the laboratory setting, cross-contamination events may occur in the safety cabinet when a smear-positive specimen is handled in parallel with a smear-negative specimen, or during the phenotypic identification of isolates during the niacin test. cross-contamination of respiratory tract specimens by the avirulent m. tuberculosis h37ra reference strain has also been reported. the mst method, which was used in this study in addition to the more commonly used vntr/miru typing method, requires a relatively small amount of sample dna from the patient. in contrast to the conventional is6110-rflp method, which requires a relatively large amount of dna, both the mst and the vntr/miru typing methods require only small dna samples as they are based on pcr amplification of selected genomic regions. the fact that such a small amount of material is handled during these aforementioned procedures is an obvious advantage, since it limits the risk of exposure of laboratory personnel to a dangerous pathogen. since the mst method is based on sequence analysis, is reproducible and is easily exchangeable, we propose and offer a free and accessible m. tuberculosis mst database so that microbiologists may compare the spacer sequence profiles they obtain with previously determined profiles for m. tuberculosis. the requirement for sequence analysis may limit the diffusion of mst to those laboratories that are equipped with an automatic sequencer, which is not a commonality in most laboratories, especially those in resource-limited countries. since mst uses pcr amplification as the first experimental step, it has the advantage of being applicable to dna extracts from inactivated mycobacterial cultures shortly after they are shown to be positive. the mst results were obtained in four working days. a similar, yet slightly longer delay of days between initial analysis and interpretation of results was recently reported when using the vntr/miru method. in contrast, the conventional is technique provided results in a median time of days. the delay period required to complete the mst analysis is certainly short enough to contribute to the interpretation of laboratory data that may have a significant clinical impact on patients.  our report confirms the importance of rapid identification of cross-contamination. indeed, the misdiagnosed patient received unnecessary anti-tuberculosis therapy and the final correct diagnosis was slightly delayed. mst typing proved to be an efficient new tool for the detection of cross-contamination with m. tuberculosis. in addition, mst results may be obtained within a few days, which significantly improves the quality of laboratory processing and, therefore, the quality of medical care for the patient. "," the ability to culture mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical specimens serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. however, a number of false-positive diagnoses may be due to cross-contamination of such specimens. we herein investigate such episode of cross-contamination by using a technique known as multispacer sequence typing. this technique was applied to six m. tuberculosis isolates prepared within the same laboratory over a two-week period of time.  mst analysis indicated a unique and common sequence profile between a strain isolated from a patient with proven pulmonary tuberculosis and a strain isolated from a patient diagnosed with lung carcinoma. using this approach, we were able to provide a clear demonstration of laboratory cross-contamination within just four working days. further epidemiological investigations revealed that the two isolates were processed for culture on the same day.  the application of mst has been demonstrated to serve as a rapid and efficient method to investigate cases of possible cross-contamination with m. tuberculosis.

66," extended spectrum beta lactamases have been reported increasingly often in the last few decades and constitute a serious threat to public health. esbls are enzymes that give a bacterium the ability to inactivate penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams, thereby yielding bacterial resistance to these commonly used antimicrobial agents. usually, the genes that encode these enzymes are found on plasmids. plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that can replicate independently of their host. they consist of double-stranded dna and carry genes that are non-essential for the host’s growth or survival. plasmids are found in virtually all bacterial species. these genetic elements can spread vertically from parent to progeny, or horizontally from cell to cell. the size of plasmids can vary from 1 kb up to 400 kb and depends on the amount of genes they carry. these genes may include, besides the household genes that regulate the autonomous plasmid replication, virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance genes. the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes, and/or virulence genes, and/or toxin-antitoxin genes can result in positive selection of these plasmids in the host and has led to evolution of plasmids over time. in datta and hedges proposed a method of classification for plasmids. this classification is based on the stability of plasmids during their transmission from host to host. the measure for this stability is ‘compatibility’ and is defined as the ability of two closely related plasmids to stably coexist in the same host cell. if a plasmid cannot co-reside with another plasmid they are said to belong to the same incompatibility group. this incompatibility is due to overlap of the plasmid replication machinery. the replication machinery thus determines the inc-group of a plasmid. since inc-typing is time-consuming, replication machinery typing is performed more often. based on this classification, carattoli et al. designed a pcr-based method to identify the replicons of the major plasmid families that are found in enterobacteriaceae. this method allows discrimination between different plasmids in a multiplex pcr setting with a total of reactions. the pcr products are analyzed for size by agarose gel visualization. recently, carattoli further updated the typing scheme. we adapted carattoli’s typing method with the aim to speed up the process of analyzing a great number of enterobacterial isolates for their plasmid content. by adding the fluorescent dye sybr-green to the pcr-mixture and amplification on a real time pcr platform, we increased the sensitivity of the assay, and simplified the product analysis by substituting the agarose gel visualization by melting curve analysis. the sybr-green approach eliminates the time-consuming agarose gels and reduces the risk of contamination.  analytical sensitivity and specificity the analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined with serial concentrations of cloned replicon dna ranging from 5 ng to 50 fg. for all different clones the pcr showed a clear melting curve position ranging from °c to °c. the dna concentrations varied from 5 ng to 5 fg of vector dna. comparison of the melting curve analysis with agarose gel electrophoresis results showed that the sensitivity of the melting curve analysis was tenfold higher than the sensitivity of the agarose method. reference plasmids, sizes and average melting temperatures obtained from at least five crude lysates of the cloned replicon plasmid. the average melting temperatures for replicons from wt strains were identical to those of the cloned replicons. specificity of the method was tested by mixing of different plasmids containing cloned replicons in a multiplex pcr reaction. the mixture of 5 pg of the three cloned replicons fiis, k and t and their six corresponding primers lead to distinguishable melting peaks with melting temperatures corresponding to those found in simplex reactions.the maximum numbers of different cloned replicons that could be detected in one reaction depended on the temperature of disassociation. all primers sets showed a clear specific melting peak, although at concentrations lower than 5 fg additional aspecific peaks appeared. because of the overlap of disassociation temperatures we chose to amplify a maximum of different replicons per reaction. replicon typing of plasmids in wild type strains the same amplification procedure was used on the crude lysates of wild type strains to evaluate applicability in a routine setting. the wild type plasmids were analyzed in fresh crude bacterial lysates. the lysates were tested in a 10- to 10- dilution for each strain. figure  illustrates an example of the results obtained with different concentrations of dna of an e. coli containing replicon fiis. in a range from 10- to 10- the melting curve was clearly visible and the melting temperature was stable. the melting temperature was identical when compared to the melting temperature observed for the cloned replicon. further dilution of the dna yielded a negative result. comparison to agarose gel results showed that the intensity of the bands corresponded with the height of the melting curves. in addition, the presence of more than one plasmid in one strain did not interfere with the accuracy and sensitivity of the melting curve assay. figure  illustrates that the melting temperature of °c and °c from the two positive controls corresponded to the peaks visible in the tested strain. discussion the emergence of esbls has become an imminent threat to public health. this threat is emphasized by the continuous appearance of new β-lactamases. although not all esbl-enzymes pose the same threat, some facilitate a wide resistance to first-line antibiotics. to date, more than different β-lactamases have been recognized. of particular concern is the rapid spread of esbls, which is due to the location of the genes that encode them on transferable plasmids in enterobacteriaceae. identification of these replicons is useful for a better understanding of the epidemiology of the esbl genes. for replicon identification carattoli et al. developed a multiplex pcr-based replicon typing method. the multiplex approach is very useful, because of the large numbers of different plasmids present in enterobacteriaceae. a drawback is that amplicons have to be identified on agarose gels. we have simplified and quickened the carattoli pcr by the incorporation of fluorescent dye sybr-green in a real time pcr. this dye intercalates in the amplicons during the pcr, and is thereby quenched. it is released from the amplicons at specific melting temperature points. upon release, quenching is abolished and fluorescence can be measured. the use of this dye eliminates the need to detect the amplicons by agarose gel electrophoresis, which means that a time-consuming step is eliminated. furthermore, since it is not necessary to open the pcr vials for analysis, the risk of contamination by other pcr replicons is decreased. another advantage of the method we present here is that it is possible to use crude cell lysates in the pcr, with no need to purify plasmid dna, which is also time and cost saving. the use of crude cell lysates has been described in previous studies and has been shown to provide solid data. a third benefit of real time pcr with sybr-green is its high analytical sensitivity. this is desirable because plasmids can be low-copy-number plasmids and because plasmid numbers vary per bacterial cell and growth phase. in for instance, waltner-toews et al. described a wild-type tem-1-carrying strain, where the plasmid occurred at an average of to copies per cell. we have shown that we can detect replicons in samples containing as little as 50 fg of dna, hence even low-copy-number plasmids can be detected. the dry weight of the average e. coli genome of mbp is approximately 5 fg, which means that in theory bacterial cells are needed to be able to detect the replicon. the pcr can be performed with single primer sets or in a multiplex setting. this allows the user to choose between the advantage of high sensitivity or the advantage of multiplexing. moreover, 96-wells plates can be used to test strains for up to different plasmid types. of course, the multiplex setting has its limitations due to an overlap in melting temperatures of some of the replicons. combinations of replicons should therefore be carefully chosen to allow to discriminate between melting peaks. recently, a commercial kit for plasmid typing was introduced. this kit provides the primers and controls needed to run the multiplex pcr, but still requires agarose gels as read out. this makes the kit a less attractive alternative for labs that have access to rt-pcr equipment. the prevalence of the different plasmid types is variable. for high prevalent plasmids several reference strains are available which can be used as positive controls. for the less prevalent plasmids it is difficult to obtain wild type reference strains. the detection of the replicons in wild type strains will permit to obtain a complete collection of all plasmid types that can serve as positive controls. this is preferable because then the plasmids are studied in their natural plasmid-backbone, which can have specific secondary structures that are lost in cloning vectors like pgem-t.  molecular epidemiologic studies of esbl genes require esbl gene characterization, plasmid identification and conjugation experiments, to demonstrate which type of plasmid carries which genes. our real-time pcr with sybr green and melting curve analysis simplifies and speeds up the detection and identification of the plasmids, both in wild-type strains and in transconjugants. "," genes encoding extended spectrum beta lactamases are usually located on transferable plasmids. each plasmid contains its own replication mechanism. carattoli et al. developed an extended pcr-based replicon typing method to characterize and identify the replicons of the major plasmid incompatibility groups in enterobacteriaceae. based on this method, we designed a rapid approach with amplicon detection by real-time melting curve analysis. this method appeared to be fast, sensitive, less laborious, less prone to contamination and applicable in a routine laboratory environment.  we successfully integrated the post-pcr analysis of the replicon typing into a closed system, which leads to a 10-fold increase in sensitivity compared to agarose gel visualization. moreover, the use of crude lysates and sybr-green saves a considerable amount of hands-on time without decreasing the sensitivity or specificity.  this real-time melting curve replicon typing method appears to be fast, sensitive, less laborious, less prone to contamination and applicable in a routine laboratory environment. esblplasmidreplicon typingsybr-green ",e48150aa-4a0b-4ac4-8105-6567160b2f1e,pubmed
67," whole genome doubling is a special case of gene duplication in that everything in the genome, including the genes, regulatory elements, and repetitive regions, is doubled or tripled. this process is more common in plant lineages than in other evolutionary domains and is an important source of gene innovations, contributing to diverse morphological and functional complexities in modern plants. the duplicated genes are very vulnerable to loss after the wgd event via excision of chromosomal segments or pseudogenization. these losses are collectively referred as fractionation. various models have been proposed to explain the details of this process, such as the gene dosage hypothesis and the gene balance hypothesis. these models try to explain the difference in duplicate gene retention pattern based on the traditional models of gene fate: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and pseudogenization, and on the observations on duplicate gene retentions from wgd. we have shown in several groups of plants - rosids, asterids, and monocots that the functional category of a gene is a major determinant of fractionation resistance, with metabolic genes being fractionation prone, and ""response to stimulus"" being fractionation resistant. a recurrent theme in works relating to fractionation is the effect of gene expression. in a comprehensive study of fractionation in paramecium, gout et al. identify a clear relationship between high wgd duplicate gene retention rates and high expression level. they also find that within each major gene functional class, higher expression correlates with higher duplicate retention rates; even if the expression levels of each major functional classes differ from each other. they conclude that expression level is the best discriminator for explaining variable resistance to fractionation. the gout et al. paper is the primary inspiration for this study, where we explore the relationship between of functional class and expression in fractionation resistance in plants. because we have previously shown that functional class can itself influence the fractionation resistance of the duplicates we wish to consolidate these two kinds of findings into one unified framework.  methods we analyze the genomes of peach, grape, and cocoa, constituting the rosids data set. these selected species have not undergone wgd events since their triplicated last common ancestor at the base of core eudicots, which makes them invaluable for studying long term effects of fractionation. to study the effect of fractionation from comparatively more recent wgd events and the effect of fractionation from multiple wgd events, we survey the genomes of tomato, utricularia, and mimulus, making up our asterids data set. the asterids diverged from the rosids a few million years after the triplication event in the core eudicots ancestor some million years ago and each of the selected species of the asterids has since undergone more recent wgd events. we will show that even if individual species of each data sets have evolved and fractionated independent of each other, the overall trend of fractionation remains highly parallel. due to the still scarce availability of high-quality expression data, we make use of rna-seq data from grape to represent expression in the rosids and rna-seq data from tomato to represent expression in the asterids. tomato gene expression values are about three to four times higher than grape values because of different technology platforms and depth of sequencing. this prevents the meaningful comparisons of absolute gene expression values between grape and tomato. normalized comparisons, however, are valid. we are interested in comparing functional categories, expression levels and fractionation among thousands of genes but the inclusion of a few extremely highly expressed genes could swamp some of these comparisons. thus we filter out the genes in the top 1% of expression levels. the filter is most pertinent to the more specific go categories such as individual enzyme classes where the number of genes in each class may be small. filtering is not necessary for the top level categories since they contain thousands of genes, but for consistency we keep the filter for all the expression analysis. to take into account varying plant tissues having different expression profiles as well as plant responses to different environments and stimuli, we use the highest reported expression value for any given gene rather than the median or the mean. the rationale for this is that the rna-seq data we are using distinguishes different expression level in different tissues as opposed to responses to a particular stimuli. many genes are only expressed in specific tissues, so the maximum expression level of a gene is a better indication of its importance in the organism. data in this comparative study we first categorize genes into distinct homology sets, where each set represents the ancestral gene of the rosids or the asterids ancestor just prior to the wgd event. categorization is based on both gene sequence similarities and positional conservation and is done using synmap with genomic resources obtained from coge. the homology sets are refined using algorithms by zheng et al.. these homology sets then allow for the calculation of levels of fractionation resistance. the fractionation resistance of a homology set is determined by the number of species that still have the genes of the set in duplicates in the form: f = n + the higher the number of species still retaining wgd in duplicates, the higher the fractionation resistance. a gene that has been returned to singleton in all species has f = each homology set is then annotated with gene ontology terms using blast2go to classify their functional class. all the terms associated with any of the genes in a homology set are retained. in addition, by design of the gene ontology if a gene is annotated with a particular go term, it automatically inherits all the parent go terms which are more general. some of our analyses include individual genes rather than whole homology sets; for these we propagate go annotation by having all genes of a homology set inheriting particular go terms if one of the genes is annotated with them. go terms are divided into three domains ""biological process"", ""cellular component"", and ""molecular function"". a homology set may not always be annotated in all three domains. most of our analyses will focus on the mutually exclusive top level categories within each domain. since most of the homology sets have fractionated to be single copies in surveyed species, we use normalized proportions to fairly compare enrichment of functional classes. we set hit = the number of ""hits"" in category c by homology classes within fractionation level f. p=hit/ ∑c′hit where the sum is taken over all category c' in the top level domain including c. as we plot p against f, we will deem c to be fractionation resistant if p increases with increasing f. we deem c to be fractionation prone if the reverse case is observed, where p deceases with increase in f. a similar formula is used to normalize the distribution of gene expression as well. log transformed expression level of genes is collected into bins of similar expression levels. functional expression e is a simple average expression of all genes of homology sets of f and c. pb=numberofgenesinbinbfromf/ ∑b′numberofgenesinf e=averageexpression functional analysis expression analysis using means and medians to summarize the expression levels of different fractionation resistant homology sets, which may be represented by one or more genes in grape we also find a trend where more highly expressed sets tend to be more resistant to fractionation. this is true regardless if we plot all genes or plot genes of specific top-level functional class. investigating more specific functional categories such as enzyme classes reveal similar findings where higher expression within each class contribute clearly to increase in fractionation resistance. this correlation of higher gene expression to fractionation resistance confirms results reported by gout et al., as reproduced in figure the startling parallelism between the rosids and the asterids is also present in figure and the trend of increase in expression level with increase in f is the same in both rosids and the asterids. the ranking of functional class by expression to f is also the same in both data sets. the effect of expression on f appears to be universal. however, the change in expression levels of sets from the least fractionation resistant to the most fractionation resistant is smaller in our rosids and asterids data sets than in. functional classes with lower number of genes are still suggestive of the trend but are no longer statistically significant in both data sets. these differences may be due to sample size rather than the differences between the protist paramecium and plants. an important difference between our results and those on paramecium is that a significant number of genes with low expression level are highly retained in the plants whereas in the paramecium, genes with high retention rates are very unlikely to have low expression level. there also exist functional classes that have widely varying expression levels across fractionation resistant class, such as genes from go term ""nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity"". however, using the distribution of gene expression to compare the different fractionation categories instead of using means of categories reveals that the highest and the lowest expression bins distort the general expression pattern of the rest of genes. therefore, the data still suggest that higher expression levels result in higher likelihood of being retained in duplicate form. on the other hand, functional class appears to have greater influence than expression on determining whether a homology set is fractionation resistant or not. both go terms ""metabolic process"" and ""catalytic activity"", which are reported to be very fractionation prone, have similar expression levels to ""response to stimulus"", a very fractionation resistant go term. the go term ""biological regulation"", one of the most fractionation resistant terms, has on average lower expression levels than any of the above-mentioned terms in both of the rosids and the asterids datasets. discussion and  how can we reconcile the relatively small effect of gene expression on fractionation resistance with the claim that gene expression levels are fundamental to copy number variations and fractionation resistance. one of the more plausible explanations is rather than just the fitness cost of gene expression controlling fractionation resistance, the fitness cost of disruption of the intended function of the gene or the gene network is a greater contributing factor. highly connected genes have been reported to be preferentially retained and are predicted to be more retained by both the gene balance hypothesis and the gene dosage hypothesis. as such, genes in a functional class that generally has low expression levels may still have high fractionation resistance level due to the importance of the function or the functional network. it should be noted that many other factors have been proposed to explain variable fractionation rates. moghe et al. showed that gene sequence features such as longer amino acid length and higher gc level, contribute to fractionation resistance in raphanus raphanistrum, arabidopsis thaliana, arabidopsis lyrata, and brassica rapa in addition to functional class. they also report that in different wgd events the degree of enrichment from gene sequence features and functional classes may vary, though the directionality of enrichments remains mostly the same. we were unable to replicate these results on our data using multiple regression; only expression level was consistently predictive of fractionation. of interest, a recent study makino et al. reports the effect of fractionation from ancient vertebrate wgd on the biased distribution of genes with copy-number variations in humans. this paper claims that retained duplicates suppress changes in copy number in their vicinity. in conclusion our result agrees with current models that expression does play a role in fractionation resistance although by itself it can not explain the enrichments of functional classes. it is likely that systemic analysis on more genomes will be needed to clarify the role of expression and other sequence feature in explaining fractionation. at the present time a good predictor of fractionation resistance should still contain both expression and functional class and may even include how connected a gene is in the genome. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions both authors participated in the research, wrote the paper, read and approved the manuscript.

68," porcine circovirus associated disease, also known as porcine circovirus disease and previously as post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, emerged in the early 1990's and soon became a major animal health problem in many swine-producing regions worldwide. the disease has several clinical presentations and can result in high mortality in growing pigs. most frequently, pcvad clinically manifests as excessive and rapid weight loss in growing pigs, respiratory illness, and increased mortality. post-mortem findings frequently include generalized lymphadenopathy on macroscopic examination, and lymphoid depletion and/or histiocytic replacement of follicles in lymphoid tissues on microscopic examination. porcine circovirus type has been recognized as a necessary cause of pcvad, but several other infectious and non-infectious factors have been identified as component causes acting through various mechanisms. studies of epidemics at the herd-level within distinct geographical regions are disproportionately rare, relative to the impact that pcvad had on production, possibly due to diagnostic uncertainty and availability of geographical and temporal information required to make inferences about the spread. reports describing large-scale extensive investigations of pcvad involving trace-back and trace-out are limited, likely reflecting the epidemiology of pcv infection, and the non-reportable nature of the disease. management changes and vaccination have been used to control the disease. in north america, commercial vaccines first became available during and since then became one of the most commonly used vaccines in growing pigs. studies conducted in different regions before vaccine introduction identified spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal trends as factors contributing to patterns of the disease spread, although not under all conditions. in our accompanying article, we have identified spatial trends in pcvad risk and described the nature of spatio-temporal dependence. this dependence was interpreted as the existence of a pattern of local spread. on the basis of this exploratory analysis, we have postulated further hypotheses about local spread and investigated them here. the primary objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for incidence cases of reported pcvad. the main exposure of interest was local spread, which in this manuscript was defined as the unidentified mechanism of pcvad spread from infectious to susceptible premises located within km of the euclidean distance.  *sd = standard deviation, iqr =

method. c estimates of the local spread where obtained from the exact logistic regression after adjusting for the herd prrs status and easting as a binary variable. adjustment for the easting as a continuous explanatory variable could not be evaluated. d best median unbiased estimates. discussion in the accompanying article, spatio-temporal clustering at the small spatial and temporal scale was detected, suggesting that local spread was a possible pattern of pcvad spread. specifically, using the space-time k-function, we detected considerable spatio-temporal clustering of cases up to approximately km of spatial and mo of temporal distance to a pcvad case, with the highest increase at km of spatial and mo of temporal distance. in contrast to the previous method, the approach taken here required that we define local exposure using fixed spatial and temporal distance, recognizing that this could lead to some misclassification of exposure. we aimed to use cutpoints that would provide a balance between specificity of defining exposures and number of herds that would be classified as exposed. thus, three km of spatial distance was selected subjectively and used as the only analytical approach for geographical distance, while a temporal distance of mo was used as the most important, but not the only, temporal cutpoint. this spatial cutpoint was in concordance with how local spread was defined in a field during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the uk. our assumption was that the causative agent of pcvad from the initially infected premises would not be more contagious to neighboring farms than the foot-and-mouth disease virus. the limitation of our original finding of the existence of apparent local spread was that the results were not adjusted for factors that could facilitate such a conclusion, even in the complete absence of radial spread of a causative agent from an infected farm to a neighboring susceptible herd. one such factor is ownership of the premises. in at least some ontario regions, premises under the same ownership cluster geographically, and finding a pattern of spatial or spatio-temporal clustering of infectious disease might be facilitated by introducing infected animals from the same source, concurrent change in management, or frequency of other component causes, or simply by recall bias of the interviewee. it was therefore of interest to explore the nature of local spread after adjusting for ownership, and a time-matched case-control study was considered a suitable design for this objective. of interest for this investigation was finding that cle was not associated with the emergence of incident pcvad cases. thus, even if local spread existed, the farms that reported a ""historical"" pcvad problem did not contribute to the emergence of incident pcvad cases in the neighborhood, at least in this study. on the other hand, the existence of spatio-temporal clustering at the small geographical and temporal scale - described in the accompanying article - was confirmed in this study by having a significant variable that was indicative of hrle. the results suggested that pcvad-positive herds were more likely to have neighboring herds involved in a recent pcvad outbreak, than the pcvad-negative herds. it is also noteworthy that this local exposure showed some limited dose-response relationship, with odds of being a case higher for herds that had two infectious herds within a 3-km distance than for herds with no infectious herds or only one such herd. interaction of hrle with time was biologically plausible and in agreement with previously reported results of pcvad spread. woodbine et al reported that radial spread was important in the later period of pcvad spread in great britain. when considered as the only term in the model, local spread has a time-varying nature. the variable indicative of local spread became statistically significant in october of corresponding approximately to the 50th percentile of reported pcvad outbreak times, and remained significant until the end of the study. however, when hrle was partitioned into within-ownership and outside-ownership, it was obvious that the likelihood of local spread was determined primarily by the co-existence of neighboring herds under the same ownership that experienced a pcvad outbreak at concurrent times. the point estimate for the odds ratio of ""high-risk local exposure within ownership"" in the final model was very high and with very wide confidence intervals. this certainly is a limitation of this analysis and is a consequence of absence of this exposure in the control herds, as visible from descriptive statistics. however, collectively these results suggest that it is possible that such a mechanism of ""local spread"" could be driven by mechanisms that do not involve any type of spatial interaction between the neighboring farms. we have no information that would allow us to further investigate these hypotheses. our results, however, suggest that exploratory spatial and spatio-temporal analysis should be substantiated by additional analyses that will take ownership or pig movement into consideration, particularly in zones where spatial clustering of premises under the same ownership exists. we defined ownership at the highest possible level, and this might have some impact on the results. large systems might have had several independent pig flows, and, theoretically, neighboring premises might belong to different flows. in such situations, the nature of high-risk exposure would likely be incorrectly classified as within-ownership. we believe that the latter scenario is relatively infrequent and would likely have a low impact on overall results and general interpretation. this issue of ownership, however, does warrant access to suitable ownership and movement databases that would allow epidemiologists to adjust their analysis for the proper ownership and the contact structure. in addition it is important to note that the interaction of hrle with time was not significant once the ownership was accounted for. although the interaction of hrle with time was a biologically plausible term to include in the final model, the owhrle was selected instead because we considered these results were more insightful in explaining the underlying biological processes. the final model also contained two additional confounders: herd prrs status and the linear effect of easting. prrs infection in individual pigs has been identified as a factor contributing to pcvad due to its effect on the immune system, and as a risk factor for pcvad expression in observational studies. also of interest was the finding that the frequency of direct contacts, including through breeding animals for a subset of suitable herds, was not identified as a risk factor. this was a surprising finding because introduction of infectious agents through live animals is considered an important component of pcvad emergence. two factors might have contributed to this. first, the frequency of visits used as a covariate in this analysis does not necessarily correspond to the time prior to a pcvad outbreak in a herd. it is possible that the frequency of direct contacts changed in response to the pcvad outbreak or an outbreak of another disease. while short-term change in frequency of movements can be expected as a part of outbreak control, a long-term change is much less likely because it would require a change in the type of farming system, typically associated with high cost. the second possible explanation is that emergence of pcvad is linked with the specific pcv source, and not with the general measure of frequency of incoming visits or movements. this is of note because either pcv as a necessary cause, or prrsv or other agents as component causes, could spread through movement of animals and have an impact on disease emergence. although frequency of feed deliveries was identified as the only significant factor related to visits, this was most likely a chance finding, on the basis of the following rationale. the significance of this association was influenced by one herd that reported a very high frequency of feed deliveries, but the feed was delivered from the farm's own feed mill. this would contrast with the logical explanation that a causative agent was distributed either through feed from an external point source, or indirectly through delivery trucks between farms. feed has been discussed as a possible source previously. evaluation of pcv transmission through feed containing contaminated porcine plasma yielded opposing results under experimental conditions. case definition was the largest limitation of this study, and the rationale for including it in the analysis is given in the accompanying article. briefly, preliminary analysis with more specific case definitions gave us similar results. additionally, the evaluation of epidemic spread under current conditions using complete set of diagnostic criteria is not possible because of high vaccination usage and endemic presence of pcv- infection in many herds. introduction of commercial pcv vaccines likely influenced the development of this outbreak. a major supplier gradually introduced its product to canada in april of. we fitted the final model only with cases that reported pcvad prior to april of and found results similar to our final model. we thus believe that results reported here were not influenced in a substantial manner by vaccination.  in conclusion, the spread of pcvad due to high-risk local exposure was primarily driven by herd ownership. it was therefore impossible to distinguish local spread from common direct or indirect sources that contributed to the emergence of disease concurrently in different premises under the same ownership. surprisingly, frequency of direct or indirect contacts did not differ between case and control herds. this also applies to frequency of feed delivery, which, although statistically significant, was driven by a single highly influential point, which in itself did not align with a biological rationale for spread through feed deliveries. two risk factors that remained stable were herd prrsv status and directional spread in a western direction. multivariable analysis following exploratory spatial analyses proved to be a useful complement for this study. after completion of this analysis, our conclusions about disease spread have changed. accounting for ownership and contact structure will become increasingly important in swine populations because investigation of spatial and temporal information alone would have yielded incomplete results and different recommendations. "," the emergence of porcine circovirus associated disease was associated with high mortality in swine populations worldwide. studies performed in different regions identified spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal trends as factors contributing to patterns of the disease spread. patterns consistent with spatial trend and spatio-temporal clustering were already identified in this dataset. on the basis of these results, we have further investigated the nature of local spread in this report. the primary objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for incidence cases of reported pcvad.  a time-matched case-control study was used as a study design approach, and conditional logistic regression as the analytical method. the main exposure of interest was local spread, which was defined as an unidentified mechanism of pcvad spread between premises located within kilometers of the euclidean distance. various modifications of variables indicative of local spread were also evaluated. the dataset contained swine herds from ontario originally sampled either from diagnostic laboratory submissions or directly from the target population. a pcvad case was defined on the basis of the producer's recall. existence of apparent local spread over the entire study period was confirmed, and was further identified to be time-varying in nature - herds experiencing outbreaks in the later part of the epidemic were more likely than control herds to be exposed to neighboring herds experiencing recent pcvad outbreaks. more importantly, the pattern of local spread was driven by concurrent occurrence of pcvad on premises under the same ownership. other significant factors included prrsv status of a herd, after adjusting for geographical location by including the binary effect of the easting coordinate.  these results preclude any conclusion regarding the existence of a mechanism of local spread through airborne transmission or indirectly through contaminated fomites or vectors, as simultaneous emergence of pcvad could also be a result of concurrent change in contributing factors due to other mechanisms within ownerships.

69," with the rapid growth in the number of sequenced genomes has come a corresponding proliferation of computational tools for viewing, comparing and searching genome sequences and annotations. tools can be divided into two broad categories, database-client and stand-alone. in general, database-client tools offer static visualizations of small sets of predefined genomes, while stand-alone tools allow interactive visualizations of locally stored genomes. stand-alone tools can serve as graphical front ends for displaying the output of locally run calculations. a high level comparison of common features for these stand-alone tools is shown in table and reveals several trends and patterns. almost all of the tools are implemented in an interpreted language. while this provides for cross platform portability, the responsiveness of these applications is poor. while all of the tools can display genome annotations, additional functionalities vary widely between programs. aprograms that use java, tcl/tk and perl are expected to run on any operating system. bcommon file formats include the genbank flat file, embl flat file, nucleic acid sequence file, general feature format and protein table file. a complete list of genome annotation file formats can be found on the genomorama project webpage. cthe graphic output format labeled ""printer"" indicates direct output to an attached printer. not content with the performance or feature set of existing programs, we wrote genomorama, a stand-alone tool originally developed to assist in computational signature design for bacterial and viral pathogen detection. genomorama allows users designing dna-based hybridization assays, such as pcr or dna probes, to easily identify the regions of a genome targeted by a given assay. it is distinguished from existing tools by dna hybridization-based sequence searching, its rapid execution speed, and ability to read and export a diverse set of common file formats. despite its origins as a viewer for viral and bacterial genomes, genomorama can also visualize large eukaryotic genomes. implementation genomorama is a software program for interactively displaying and analyzing multiple genomes. it provides a powerful yet easy to use interface that leverages the visualization power of modern computers and the substantial bioinformatic infrastructure provided by the ncbi. genomorama is written in portable, highly optimized c++ and comes in three ""flavors"" that allow it to run natively on modern operating systems: os x, microsoft windows and linux. the motif version allows any x-windows client that supports opengl to remotely run genomorama. executables and source code are freely provided for all flavors.  to visualize and compare annotated genome features at all relevant size scales, genomes are displayed on the computer screen as linear, scale-dependent maps. the user interacts with a map using the mouse, keyboard and scroll bars. semantic zooming is used to display genomic features which occur at a wide range of scales, i.e. ~ bases for a mammalian gene, ~ bases for a pathogenicity island, ~ bases for a bacterial gene, ~ bases for a trna, ~ bases for a transcription factor binding site and for a single nucleotide polymorphism. optional 2d graphs, including %g+c, gc skew and external data sets, can be superimposed on genome maps. publication quality, wysiwyg images can be saved in either gif or postscript formats. genome annotations and sequences are available in a large number of file formats and genomorama can read a substantial subset of these formats, including genbank, european molecular biology laboratory, abstract syntax notation one, protein table and fasta. unlike existing programs, genomorama can read the multi-part gbk, embl and asn. files used to store annotations and sequence for partially assembled sequences for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. the ability to load multipart annotation files allows access to preliminary annotation information provided by sequencing centers during the whole genome shotgun sequencing of an organism. a screen shot of five contigs and associated sequencing quality scores from the genome sphingopyxis alaskensis rb is shown in figure genomorama can load large genomes. support for large genomes is crucial for visualizing entire eukaryotic chromosomes. a comparison between loading times for genomorama and two java-based visualization tools is shown in figure conservative memory usage and efficient c++ implementation enable genomorama to load the sequence and annotations for human chromosome substantially faster than either of the java-based programs on a range of desktop computers. to assist in experimental design and analysis, genomorama provides dna hybridization-based searches to identify probe binding locations and pcr amplification products. given a pair of pcr primers, genomorama will display all corresponding pcr amplicons from a target sequence. both traditional pcr primer and padlock probe queries are supported. these searches employ a sequence similarity criteria defined by dna melting temperature, which allows for non-watson and crick base pairing, and an optional number of exact matching bases at the 3' end of each primer. all possible combinations of the forward and reverse pcr primers are tested. in contrast, existing in-silico pcr tools are either inflexible or rely on heuristic similarity measures. genomorama also performs primer prediction by computing all potential forward and reverse pcr primers that satisfy primer length, melting temperature, %g+c and heuristic base composition requirements. an example of pcr primer based searching, using the b. anthracis specific primers, is shown in figure finally, sequence searching is sensitive to the topology of the target dna molecule and, as a result, can identify query matches that span the start/stop of circular genomes.  genomorama is an easy to use computational tool for a number of genome comparison tasks, including real time display of multiple genomes, high quality output and novel hybridization based sequence searching.

70," the use of gene expression profiling for the classification of human cancers has been widely investigated. previous works were successful in predicting tumor types in the context of binary problems. many algorithms for feature extraction and sample classification have been proposed. more recently, a method for addressing the potential mislabeling in the training set was proposed for binary classification of cancer samples. as there are over a hundred types of cancers, and potentially even more subtypes, it is essential to develop multi-category methodologies for molecular classification for any practical application. multi-category prediction can be achieved using binary classification algorithms via the one-versus-one and/or one-versus-rest partition of the training data set. however, in a cancer type prediction, multi-category problems proved to be more challenging than simple binary problems, and the reported results were less than satisfactory. on one hand, when the available resource is limited and the sample size of a given category is small, classifiers based on the ovr partition of the data set potentially suffer from severe over-fitting, leading to low predictive ability and robustness. furthermore, the substantial noise introduced by implementing the numerous classifiers under an ovo scheme and the asymmetric training sets caused by ovr partitioning of the data will inevitably weaken the classification system. on the other hand, the effects of biological and technical noise together with the genetic heterogeneity of samples within a clinically defined tumor class decrease the predictive power in a multiple setting. in disease diagnostic, a measurement of confidence or uncertainty reported with the type determination is always desirable. however, some well-established statistical criteria often become less credible and of little biological meaning for highly heterogeneous cancer types, especially in the context of multiple cancer types. a potential reason is that the winning classifier used to discriminate one cancer type from others could be weak or unstable due to limited training samples. although this phenomenon was alluded to in previous studies, it has not received appropriate attention. figure presents a graphical illustration of the problem. using an ovr binary classifier, all samples of a homogeneous cancer type were classified correctly and with high confidence. all other cancer type samples in the group have probabilities of being cancer type a close to zero. however, the situation was very different when a heterogeneous cancer class was considered. in fact, some samples of cancer b type had classification probability lower than. such low classification probability could lead to misdiagnosis if a hard classification rule is applied. it is possible that such low probability is due to the weakness of the classifier that is established with a highly heterogeneous training set. the jackknife is a well known, non-parametric method often used for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic. given a sample dataset and a desired statistic, the jackknife works by computing the desired statistic with an element removed from the equation. the process is repeated for each element in the dataset. the application in cancer classification with gene expression profiling has been reported in the context of binary problems. in that study, the individual maximum difference subsets of genes identified from a set of jackknife subsets of samples were aggregated to generate the ""overall mdss"" in order to return the expected classification. in other words, jackknife was used for feature selection rather than for training multiple sub-classifiers. in this study, a new learning method called paired-samples test algorithm, which is based on the jackknife method, was used to classify multiple tumor types using gene expression data. the proposed method is designed for solving multi-category problems under an ovr scheme with a very limited training data set, and it is similar to the bootstrap aggregating procedure, which proved to be helpful in improving weak classifiers. in order to get a relative measurement of uncertainty in the prediction of a sample category, the training sample being removed each time was predicted together with the training samples. the procedure was implemented in a parsimonious way, making its integration with a computationally intensive algorithm, such as the stochastic, regulation-based binary regression, feasible. the performance of the proposed method was evaluated under several scenarios of gene selection criteria using two well known and challenging datasets: the gcm and nci datasets containing and cancer tumor types, respectively.  determination of the optimum number of genes to be used by the classification algorithm is usually a difficult task that depends on several factors, including the classification algorithms and the complexity of the data set. for the used binary regression algorithm, previous studies have shown that a feature set of one to two hundred top genes is adequate for a simple two category problem. in this study, the size of the feature set used was or genes for the gcm dataset and or genes for the nci dataset. gcm data the prediction accuracy of the validation samples, using different gene selection procedures, is summarized in figure the results showed that fold change and penalized t-statistic based methods for feature selection outperformed the t-statistic-based procedure. in most cases, the application of pst improved the prediction accuracy or maintained the high accuracies that had been obtained prior to its application, except in the scenario of genes and penalized t-statistic. the largest improvement occurred when genes were considered using different feature selection criteria, resulting in an increase in accuracy ranging from % to %. the combination of genes, fold change-based feature selection and pst had the highest prediction accuracy of %. additionally, almost 50% of the % incorrectly classified samples had their true tumor type predicted as the second possible classification in this scenario. it should be noted that while the largest improvements were seemingly coming from the weaker gene selection mechanisms, the application of pst made the binary regression algorithm more robust in relation to the gene selection methods and the size of the gene set to be used. these prediction results are, in general, better than those obtained by several previous studies using the same data set. using a recursive feature elimination procedure and a support vector machine classification algorithm, ramaswamy et al. obtained their best result with tumors correctly predicted among the test samples, corresponding to an accuracy of 78%. using a feature selection algorithm based on the overlaps of gene expression values between different classes in conjunction with the covering classification algorithm, a modification of the k-nn method, bagirov et al. achieved a prediction accuracy of around 80%. based on the concept of gene interaction, antonov et al proposed a maximal margin linear programming procedure that combines linear programming and svm. using mama, only eight test samples were misclassified. although slightly superior to our method in the overall accuracy, the lack of information about confusion profiles of the prediction and the secondary classification of non-correctly predicted samples make the direct comparison between both methods difficult. recently, sheng and tan reported a prediction accuracy of around 83% by using error correcting out codes, svm and a recursive feature elimination procedure. the output coding based approach is very costly in implementation and the result was highly sensitive to the decoding functions and the length of the random code. a in parenthesis are the assigned tumor types for the misclassified samples. it is possible that the superiority of the proposed method over svm and other learning algorithms could be related to the difference in gene selection methods used in this study and by ramaswamy et al and bagirov et al. however, our preliminary work as well as readily available information demonstrated that svm outperformed k-nn, nn, pnn and the decision tree in general does not support such a claim. in fact, the highest accuracies obtained using svm occurred when 200- genes were selected based on fc, t-statistics, penalized t-statistics and non-parametric anova, ranging from % to %. these were well below the results obtained using our approach. as indicated in table it seems that some tumor types are easily predicted. for example, ly, ut, me and csn tumors had 100% prediction accuracy using all three methods. meanwhile, other types, such as br, had a high misclassification rate ranging from to 75%, indicating potential excess heterogeneity. additionally, the profile of misclassified samples was very different between the four studies. in fact, among the four br tumors, two were misclassified as ov and pa in ramaswamy et al, three were misclassified as lu, lu and bl in bagirov et al, and three were misclassified as le, pa, and ut in the current study. to further validate the results behind the use of the independent test samples, a four-fold cross validation was conducted for the training samples. the results of this validation are presented in figure in most scenarios, the prediction accuracy was improved when the proposed jackknife method was used. the highest value was %, which was achieved from several combinations of the gene selection method and gene number, including the case of fc-based gene selection and genes. this accuracy value was similar to the best performance of % obtained using the independent test samples, and it is % higher than the accuracy obtained by ramaswamy et al.the np-anova feature selection performed marginally better in the cross validation than in the independent test with the highest prediction accuracy of %. ppp rediction uncertainty uncertainty of the correctly classified test samples from the best result is graphically presented in figure among these samples, eight tumors had high f and nearly 3/ of the tumors had their prediction confidence <. for the classification algorithm used in this study, f was defined as the aggregate probability that the test sample t belongs to the assigned tumor type. in this context, considering f alone makes the current prediction results seem unexpected. however, when taking r values into account, confidence measurement, or f, appears to be in better agreement with the results of this study. of those samples with lower prediction confidence, the majority had their r between - and, suggesting that their lower prediction confidences were mainly due to the potential weakness of the classifiers and/or some moderate heterogeneity. in addition, the profile of the four metastatic prostate samples was interesting. although they were predicted with 100% accuracy, their relative confidences were low. this suggests the metastatic tumors can be distinguished from the primary tumors of the same type by using the proposed relative confidence criterion. nci data there were no independent test samples in the nci dataset. consequently, ten-fold cross validation was conducted as in statnikov et al. the results are summarized in figure in most scenarios, the prediction accuracy ranged from % to %. the improvement due to the use of the pst algorithm was not as significant as with the gcm data. a modest improvement was observed when the number of used genes was relative small. one explanation is that, because some tumor types had a very limited number of samples available for training the classifiers, holding out one sample from the training set as is required for the implementation of pst sharpened sample shortage and weakened the trained classifiers. nevertheless, the prediction accuracy obtained was comparable to the best reported results using this dataset. according to statnikov et al., svm-based methods performed much better than k-nn, pnn and other non-svm methods with an accuracy ranging from % to %. furthermore, it was evident from our study that breast cancer samples were unpredictable. this result is consistent with ross et al, in which the br samples could not be clustered together. the reason could be that the br samples contained estrogen positive and estrogen negative subtypes.  in cancer type predictions, multi-category problems have proven to be more challenging than binary cases, not only in the classification accuracy but also in the assessment of uncertainty. in this paper, a jackknife-like classification method, called paired-samples test algorithm, was proposed and applied to two bench datasets of multiple tumor types. the results showed that the proposed method has improved the prediction accuracy of test samples in the gcm dataset, especially when t-statistics were used for primary feature selection. for the nci dataset, improvement was observed only when the number of used genes was relative small. these improvements made the binary regression algorithm more robust to gene selection and the number of genes used. the core idea of the proposed method is to repeatedly test a certain known tumor type with a blind test sample while withholding an associated training sample; in this way, not only can the prediction be made but also the relative confidence r of the prediction can be accessed by measuring the difference between the prediction probability of the test sample and the corresponding value of the withheld training sample. r provided insight into the sources of the uncertainty in the statistical classification by revealing the loss in confidence due to the utilization of weak classifiers or heterogeneity in a given tumor type. it is possible to combine the measurement f and r to make a better score for type determination. our continuous work will consider this possibility in regards to penalizing a negative r value. "," the use of gene expression profiling for the classification of human cancer tumors has been widely investigated. previous studies were successful in distinguishing several tumor types in binary problems. as there are over a hundred types of cancers, and potentially even more subtypes, it is essential to develop multi-category methodologies for molecular classification for any meaningful practical application.  a jackknife-based supervised learning method called paired-samples test algorithm, coupled with a binary classification model based on linear regression, was proposed and applied to two well known and challenging datasets consisting of and tumor types. the results showed that the proposed method improved the prediction accuracy of the test samples for the gcm dataset, especially when t-statistic was used in the primary feature selection. for the nci dataset, the application of pst improved prediction accuracy when the numbers of used genes were relatively small. these improvements made the binary classification method more robust to the gene selection mechanism and the size of genes to be used. the overall prediction accuracies were competitive in comparison to the most accurate results obtained by several previous studies on the same datasets and with other methods. furthermore, the relative confidence r provided a unique insight into the sources of the uncertainty shown in the statistical classification and the potential variants within the same tumor type.  we proposed a novel bagging method for the classification and uncertainty assessment of multi-category tumor samples using gene expression information. the strengths were demonstrated in the application to two bench datasets.

71," vaccination is a highly effective approach to disease control in human and veterinary health care. a vaccine is a molecular or supramolecular agent which elicits specific, protective immunity; that is an enhanced adaptive immune response to re-infection by pathogenic microbes through the potentiation of immune memory. vaccination ultimately mitigates the effect of subsequent infection and disease. thus, the immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and subsequently'remembers' them. when the pathogenic microorganism is encountered again, the immune system has been primed to respond, by neutralizing the target before it can enter cells, or/and by destroying infected cells before the microorganism can grow and cause damage. vaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, the near eradication of polio, and the control of a variety of diseases, including rubella, measles, mumps, chickenpox, typhoid. vaccines from the pre-genomic era were based on killed or live, but attenuated, microorganisms, or subunits purified from them. subunit vaccines contain one or more pure or semi-pure antigens. in order to develop subunit vaccines, it is critical to identify those proteins which are important for inducing protection and to eliminate others. an antigen is said to be protective if it is able to induce protection from subsequent challenge by a disease-causing infective agent in an appropriate animal model following immunization. the empirical approach to sub-unit vaccine development, which includes several steps, begins with pathogen cultivation, followed by purification into components, and then testing of antigens for protection. apart from being time- and labour-consuming, this approach has several limitations that can lead to failure. vaccines can not be developed using this approach for microorganisms which can not easily be cultured and only allows for the identification of those antigens which can be obtained in sufficient quantities. in some cases, the most abundant proteins are not immunoprotective. in other cases, the antigen expressed during in vivo infection is not expressed during in vitro cultivation. genomics has revolutionized vaccine research. the ability to sequence the whole genome of a virulent microorganism has led some to screen in silico for the most probable protective antigens before undertaking confirmatory experiments. this approach, known as reverse vaccinology, was first used to identify antigens as potential candidate vaccines against serogroup b meningococcus. apart from obvious advantages – such as speed and low cost – the success of this approach is dependent on the accuracy of antigen prediction, and many bioinformatics tools are available to facilitate this process. they can identify surface-associated or outer membrane proteins, signal peptides, lipoproteins, or host-cell binding domains. most algorithms use sequence alignment to identify antigens. this is problematic for several reasons. some proteins formed through divergent or convergent evolution lack obvious sequence similarity, although they may share similar structures and biological properties. in such a situation, alignment-based approaches may produce ambiguous results or fail. moreover, antigenicity, as a property, may be encoded in a sequence in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification by sequence alignment. likewise, the discovery of truly novel antigens will be frustrated by their lack of similarity to antigens of known provenance. to overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence similarity methods, we propose a new alignment-independent method for antigen prediction based on auto cross covariance transformation of protein sequences into uniform equal-length vectors. acc is an protein sequence mining method developed by wold et al., which has been applied to quantitative structure-activity relationships studies of peptides with different length and for protein classification. the acc transformation accounts for neighbour effects, i.e. the lack of independence between different sequence positions. in the present study, we applied acc pre-processing to sets of known bacterial, viral and tumour antigens and developed alignment-independent models for antigen recognition based on the main chemical properties of amino acid sequences. the principal properties of the amino acids were represented by z descriptors, originally derived by hellberg et al. to describe amino acid hydrophobicity, molecular size and polarity. the models were implemented in a server for the prediction of protective antigens and subunit vaccines, which we call vaxijen. this is freely accessible via the world wide web. our method is the first alignment-free bioinformatics tool for the in silico identification of antigens.  three datasets were used in this study: one for bacteria, one for viruses, and one for tumours. each set consisted of known antigens and non-antigens, collected as described in the methods section. each amino acid in the protein sequence was represented by three z descriptors: z z and z each protein was transformed into a uniform vector, which consisted of acc terms, by applying acc pre-processing, as described in the methods section. the new matrices were imported into simca-p and were subject to a two-class discriminant analysis using the partial least squares technique. the models were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation on the whole sets and by external validation using test sets. the test sets were selected randomly to include 25% of the whole sets. then models were developed based on the remaining 75% and tested on the excluded proteins. the validation results were assessed in terms of aucroc, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, as described in the methods section. additionally, five negative sets were compiled, and subsequently combined with the positive set to generate five new training sets. they also underwent da-pls and their aucroc, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are given as mean values. within the server, the final model for each type was derived as a mean of the best five models, as assessed by loo-cv. vaxijen model for prediction of protective bacterial antigens the loo-cv of the bacterial model had 82% accuracy, 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity. as expected, the external validation showed a lower value but was still satisfactory. the roc curves are shown in figure the average values for the additional sets

excellent performance both in the loo-cv and in the external validation, exhibiting more than 85% accuracy. the roc curves are shown in figure the additional models had lower sensitivity but similar specificity and accuracy. sequence similarity of training set potential similarity between sequences in the antigen and non-antigen sets was assessed as described. the viral and bacterial protective antigen sequence sets show very little sequence similarity. this reflects their diverse species origins. the tumour set, derived from a single proteome, exhibits a higher internal degree of self-similarity, but is still clearly highly diverse. vaxijen server the loo-cv bacterial, viral and tumour models were included in the vaxijen server. protein sequences can be submitted as single proteins or uploaded as a multiple sequence file in fasta format. a single target organism can be selected. additionally, acc coefficients can be output. this option makes the server useful for general acc calculations of proteins. the results page lists the selected target, the protein sequence, its prediction probability, and a statement of protective antigen or non-antigen, according to a predefined cutoff. since more of the models had their highest accuracy at a threshold of, this threshold value was chosen for all types. discussion vaxijen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens of bacterial, viral and tumour origin. the server contains models derived by acc pre-processing of amino acids properties. the predictive ability of our models was tested by internal leave-one-out cross-validation on training sets and by external validation on test sets. accuracies of internal and external validation for the three models lie in the range 70% to 89%. the models showed remarkable stability, as tested by combinations of the positive set and five different negative sets. thus, vaxijen is a reliable and consistent tool for the prediction of protective antigens. it can be used singly or in combination with other bioinformatics tools used for reverse vaccinology. the z descriptors are highly condensed descriptors, and are derived from a principal component analysis of experimental or calculated physicochemical properties of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids. they correspond to the first three principal components explaining the variance in the set: z represents hydrophobicity, z steric properties, and z polarity of the amino acids. since their creation, z descriptors have been widely used for the characterization and classification of proteins, and in qsar studies on peptides. recently, we have found that z descriptors are good predictors of mhc binding peptides. in the present study, z descriptors represent the main physicochemical properties important for the recognition of antigens. acc transformations were used to remove irrelevant information, such as sequence length, and to amplify the class-discriminating properties. sjostrom et al applied the acc transformation to z scale values in order to assign successfully the subcellular location of bacterial proteins. more recently, a similar method was applied to g-protein coupled receptors and succeeded in classifying them into their major classes. as antigenicity is not a simple, readily-interpreted linear property, it is unsurprising that acc pre-processing of the physicochemical properties of antigens and non-antigens allows for a good discrimination between them. the recognition of protective antigens arises synergistically from a combination of intermolecular interactions which involves a diverse variety of underlying features – steric, electrostatic and hydrophobic – which are explained well by the three z descriptors. the most important result of the present work is the ability of the models to predict whether a protein sequence will, or will not, be a protective antigen. such antigens form the basis of subunit vaccines. in order to facilitate the use of the derived models, a server, named vaxijen, was developed to allow users to assess a protein's ability to induce protection. the server deals with single proteins as well as whole proteomes submitted in fasta format. as the method is general, models for parasite and fungal antigens will be developed in the future and included in the vaxijen server.  vaxijen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. it was developed to allow antigen classification based solely on the physicochemical properties of the protein irrespective of sequence length and the need for alignment. vaxijen is an open system: new models will be included in the future, old ones will be improved. the server can be used singly or in combination with alignment-dependent prediction methods. "," vaccine development in the post-genomic era often begins with the in silico screening of genome information, with the most probable protective antigens being predicted rather than requiring causative microorganisms to be grown. despite the obvious advantages of this approach – such as speed and cost efficiency – its success remains dependent on the accuracy of antigen prediction. most approaches use sequence alignment to identify antigens. this is problematic for several reasons. some proteins lack obvious sequence similarity, although they may share similar structures and biological properties. the antigenicity of a sequence may be encoded in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification by sequence alignment. the discovery of truly novel antigens will be frustrated by their lack of similarity to antigens of known provenance. to overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent methods, we propose a new alignment-free approach for antigen prediction, which is based on auto cross covariance transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties.  bacterial, viral and tumour protein datasets were used to derive models for prediction of whole protein antigenicity. every set consisted of known antigens and non-antigens. the derived models were tested by internal leave-one-out cross-validation and external validation using test sets. an additional five training sets for each class of antigens were used to test the stability of the discrimination between antigens and non-antigens. the models performed well in both validations showing prediction accuracy of 70% to 89%. the models were implemented in a server, which we call vaxijen.  vaxijen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. it was developed to allow antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment. the server can be used on its own or in combination with alignment-based prediction methods. it is freely-available online at the url:.

72," central to life functions, protein expression in normal and diseased states is essential for quantifying altered patterns of gene expression. this is especially true in the era that the sequencing of human genome has been finished. to gain insights into protein expression, we have to transfect cells with kinds of expression vectors, based on plasmid, viral vector, or transposon, etc. transfection may be one of the commonest but indispensable procedures for cellular biology. however, in the process of evolution, eukaryotic cells tend to have low transfection efficiency in order to protect their genomes from exogenous insults. transfection difficulty manifests itself, especially in the cotransfection of mammalian cells. theoretically, if the transfection efficiency of single kind of plasmid is e, which ranges from to the efficiency of double and triple cotransfection may decline to e and e respectively. therefore, it is of great importance to improve efficiency. in order to enhance the transfection, several kinds of strategies are developed, which are categorized into two types: viral gene delivery carriers and non-viral gene delivery carriers. in non-viral gene delivery carriers, cationic liposomes has the widest application. cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged dna molecules to form a stable complex. cationic liposomes consist of a positively charged lipid and a co-lipid. a variety of positively charged lipid formulations are commercially available and many other are under development. lipofection, one of the most frequently cited cationic lipids, was first reported by felgner in to deliver genes to cells in culture. lipofection has been used to deliver linear dna, plasmid dna, and rna to a variety of cells in culture. liposomes offer several advantages in delivering genes to cells. liposomes have the ability to combine both with negatively and positively charged molecules. liposomes offer a degree of protection to the dna from degradative processes. liposomes carry large pieces of dna, potentially as large as a chromosome. liposomes can be targeted to specific cells or tissues. in addition, liposomes overcome problems inherent with viral vectors – specific concerns over immunogenicity and replication competent virus contamination. liposomes resulted in a highly adaptable and flexible system capable of gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. current limitations regarding in vivo application of liposomes revolve around the low transfection efficiencies and transient gene expression. also, liposomes display a small degree of cellular toxicity and appear to be inhibited by serum components. the ability to overcome these problems should greatly facilitate their application to a variety of gene delivery mechanisms. several factors have significant effects on the transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes, such as vigor of the host cells, the amount of plasmid, the amount of transfection agent, and the density of cells. however, it is hard to control vigor of host cells which has not a quantitative index. the other three factors are controllable in transfection, which can be adjusted according to the host cells and transfection agents. however, the adjustment of these three factors is a time and energy-consuming work. for most researchers, they may spend two to three months on optimizing transfection. fortunately, several mathematical methods offer promising avenues to the resolution of this issue. there are several ways to perform computer experiments, such as latin hypercube sampling and uniform design. lhs was brought up by three scholars in the north american. uniform design, abbreviated as ud, was first developed by fang et al in nineteen eighty. ud seeks design points that are scattered uniformly on the domain. it has been popular since the main advantages of ud may be generalized as the following: first, it has the ability to greatly reduce the number of experiments while not to alter the representativeness; second, it generates a regression model based on the results and it's able to predict at what independent variables the dependent variable may gain the maximum. as a relatively new algorithm used for classification and regression, support vector machine was developed in the 1990s. it is a desired method for estimation based on finite-sample and therefore is able to solve a lot of practical problems in case of limited samples. their practical successes may be attributed to solid theoretical foundations based on vapnik chervonenkis theory, and to the minimization of structural risk. in order to implement the svm into our transfection optimization, the least squares support vector machines was used, which has a growing popularity for regression problems. it can be argued that ls-svm would yield better generalization for regression problems on finite samples.  as was shown in table and figure transfection efficiency varied greatly with the changes of the amount of plasmid, lipofectamine, and the number of seeded cells. if these three independent varies did not match, transfection efficiency would decline sharply. in table and figure experiment l has the lowest efficiency for the ration of plasmid to transfection agent is too low, while experiment k has the highest efficiency owing to the designed ratios between the three independent factors. according to the established model, transfection efficiency would gain the maximum if × of cells, μg of plasmid and μg of lipofectamine were used. and this was accord with the observed data. more than that, there was a high degree of coincidence between calculated transfection efficiency and the deduced date from the model. thus, by virtue of ud and ls-svm, only experiments, which can be performed in two 24-well plates, are needed to get the optimal transfection conditions whereas more than experiments are needed to attain the expected purpose by using traditional method. what's more, if more accurate conditions were demanded, the number of experiments would greatly exceed *: in these independent variables, the numbers outside of round brackets refer to serial numbers of their levels, and the numbers inside of round brackets refer to the actual dosages. the proper setting of ls-svm model training parameters was tuned by grid search. the most common performance assessment method is probably the k-fold cross-validation and the leave-one-out procedure. in the k-fold cross-validation, the training data are randomly split into k mutually exclusive subsets with approximately equal sizes. the resulting ls-svm model is obtained by training on k- subsets and then the model is tested on the remaining one subset. this procedure is repeated for k times and in this fashion each subset is used for testing only once. by averaging the test errors over the k trials it gives an estimate of the expected generalization error. the leave-one-out procedure can be viewed as an extreme form of the k-fold cross-validation with k equal to the number of examples. leave-one-out is known as an unbiased estimation method for small-samples problems, such as our application. therefore, fifteen times of training and test repeated on a pair of parameters and each mse value for a pair of parameters were reported by the leave-one-out procedure. part of results was listed in table as was shown in table the minimum mse is found at a pair of parameters, and then the ls-svm model obtains a peak estimated performance. after the optimal parameters for model construction are known, the according model is validated by predicting the validation data and comparing these predictions with the real observations. the discrepancy between the predicted value and their respective observed data was listed in table from table it could be find that the maximum of observed data was n and the maximum of predicted values based on ls-svm was also n. the error ratio between observed data and predicted value of ls-svm was less than 10%. thus, ls-svm has an excellent predicted ability on our problem. the mutual influence between the predicted value and two of all the three variables was shown in figure and in a three dimensional surface, each mesh point in the -plane stood for a variable combination and the z-axis stood the predicted value. figure and showed that the change of ls-svm predicted value on ten test samples was consistent with observed data. the contribution of a specific independent variable was also evaluated. table showed the average mse when one specific variable was ignored. as is indicated by table and figure and amount of plasmid has the most significant effect on transfection efficiency, followed by amount of lipofectamine, while the density of seeded cells has the least effect on transfection efficiency. and this result coincided with our experience. x1: density of seeded cells; x2: amount of plasmid; x3: amount of lipofectamine owing to ud, the amount of test points required can be enormously reduced, especially when the experimental region has many factors and multiple levels, while the results that reflect the major characteristics of the experimental system are ensured. as an efficient fractional factorial design, ud has been widely applied in manufacturing, system engineering, pharmaceutics, and natural sciences in the past decades. the ud was used in this research to describe factors that significantly influence transfection efficiency to obtain a smaller, more manageable set. to perform a computer experiment, in order to have a wide coverage of the entire design region with a limited number of runs, ud is a good recommendation. the svm is a machine learning technique with a strong theoretical foundation that has been used to improve classification accuracy in biological applications. the svm is a maximum margin classifier that can solve non-linear classification problems by learning an optimal separating hyperplane in a higher-dimensional feature space. by use of non-linear kernel functions such as a gaussian kernel, complex and non-linear decision functions can be learned by the svm. ls-svm is a reformulation to standard svm. it is closely related to regularization networks and gaussian processes but it additionally emphasizes and exploits primal-dual interpretations from optimization theory. in our experiment, ls-svm mapped the original input space into a high dimension feature space by a gaussian kernel and then learns a smoothest hyperplane to fit the training data. from statistical learning theory, it can be expected that this hyperplane would have excellent generalization ability and has minor local extreme value. together, ud has the ability to greatly reduce the number of experiments while not to alter the representativeness and ls-svm would yield better generalization for regression problems on finite samples. thereupon, the integrated application of ud and ls-svm would have high prediction accuracy and would contribute to transfection optimization.  this paper investigates the integrated application of ud and ls-svm to transfection, for obtaining precise information on the optimal conditions. based on our experiments, ud and ls-svm appear to have high efficiency and perform well even when undergone experiments are extremely scarce. with the established model, we are able to gain the optimal transfection conditions and the highest transfection efficiency that can be reached. thus, the required time and experiments to improve transfection efficiency can be greatly reduced while the achieved efficiency may even be higher than traditional methods. it seems that ls-svm has higher accuracy in the prediction of optimal transfection conditions than it does in the prediction of highest transfection efficiency; nevertheless, we usually have higher stringency of the information on optimal transfection conditions. it should be pointed out that the vigor of host cells and the purity of plasmid have crucial effect on the transfection efficiency too. however, these factors are uncontrollable in most settings. further interpretation of the results obtained from other host cell lines is required. these issues are part of our ongoing research. "," transfection in mammalian cells based on liposome presents great challenge for biological professionals. to protect themselves from exogenous insults, mammalian cells tend to manifest poor transfection efficiency. in order to gain high efficiency, we have to optimize several conditions of transfection, such as amount of liposome, amount of plasmid, and cell density at transfection. however, this process may be time-consuming and energy-consuming. fortunately, several mathematical methods, developed in the past decades, may facilitate the resolution of this issue. this study investigates the possibility of optimizing transfection efficiency by using a method referred to as least-squares support vector machine, which requires only a few experiments and maintains fairly high accuracy.  a protocol consists of experiments was performed according to the principle of uniform design. in this protocol, amount of liposome, amount of plasmid, and the number of seeded cells h before transfection were set as independent variables and transfection efficiency was set as dependent variable. a model was deduced from independent variables and their respective dependent variable. another protocol made up by experiments was performed to test the accuracy of the model. the model manifested a high accuracy. compared to traditional method, the integrated application of uniform design and least-squares support vector machine greatly reduced the number of required experiments. what's more, higher transfection efficiency was achieved.  the integrated application of uniform design and least-squares support vector machine is a simple technique for obtaining high transfection efficiency. using this novel method, the number of required experiments would be greatly cut down while higher efficiency would be gained. least-squares support vector machine may be applicable to many other problems that need to be optimized.

73," next generation sequencing technologies are generating massive sequence data, and different platforms can introduce varied level of sequence reads error. among them, the illumina platform is the most widely used for genome sequencing with the least error rate per base. however, due to the nature of the method, it still presents a considerable amount of errors that has its specific errors pattern. the device performs sequencing by dna synthesis on clusters of identical dna molecules simultaneously. when elongation of some dna molecules is stopped accidentally, it creates disturbance of the cluster’s fluorescent signal, resulting sequencing errors. such errors accumulate during the process of sequencing, and cause reads quality decreasing while the length grows. besides, deficiency on sequencing chips and the existence of air bubbles on chip surface can cause failure on reads from a whole tile. to get reliable result in downstream analysis, it is necessary to remove low quality reads avoiding mismatches in read mapping, and false paths during genome assembly. currently there are several reads quality control software tools. however, all these software tools lack of function versatility or run-time efficiency. for example, piqa and fastqc only create reports on reads quality, but provide no tool for reads filtration. solexaqa and bigpre provide only read trimming utility. furthermore, many of these software tools are implemented using perl language, which as a dynamic-typed script language, provides ease on developing mini programs, but causes severe loss on run-time performance. therefore, a high performance sequence reads qc toolkit is needed for a faster assessment and versatile functionality. implementation the htqc toolkit consists of six programs that can perform reads quality assessment and filtration. to improve run-time performance, the time-consuming programs are implemented using c++. the fastq format is used for sequence data input and output, and the qc report is generated as tab-separated plain-text file. to create graphical charts of qc report, a perl script is included. the gnu glib is used for base utilities such as command-line parser, portable support for threads and asynchronous queues. all programs of htqc toolkit are capable of single-end or paired-end sequencing experiments, 33-based or 64-based quality score encodings and fastq sequence identifier format from different version of casava tools. the quality control pipeline begins with a quality assessment on raw reads. program ht_stat generates qc report from raw sequence reads in different aspects. on each position of the sequence reads, a heat map and a box chart are presented with quality distribution. the stacked bar chart that represents the base composition on each position is shown at the same time. the cycle-specific errors and the rapid-falling quality on reads tail can be viewed on these three charts. to find tile-specific problems like high error rate or low data production, a stacked bar chart shows the number of reads in different quality ranges using different color, each tile in one bar. the other charts that show the distribution of reads with varied length and reads with varied quality can provide an overview of sequencing quality. for paired-end reads quality assessment, the ht_stat program is used to create separate charts for each end, and to calculate the correlation between reads quality of two ends. all these results generated by ht_stat program are written to a series of tab-delimited plain-text files, which can be visualized using ht_stat_draw.pl, or any spreadsheet software like microsoft excel or libreoffice calc. after the assessment of sequence reads quality is obtained, low quality reads should be removed. the htqc tool kit provides four different programs that include ht_tile_filter, ht_trim, ht_qual_filter and ht_length_filter, to perform reads filtration. the ht_tile_filter is designed to remove reads from problematic tiles that may not be reliable due to sequencing chip quality; the ht_trim cuts low quality bases at the beginning or the end of the reads until the quality score reaches a given threshold; the ht_qual_filter remove reads with low quality and the ht_length_filter remove short reads. when only one end of the paired-end reads is of acceptable quality, it is stored in a separate file. the cutoff value of these programs, such as the thresholds on the minimum reads quality or minimum read length are user defined.  workflow demonstration to demonstrate the function of htqc, a paired-end sequence data of human gut metagenome was used as an example. to reduce the time cost, one tenth from a total of, paired-end reads were randomly picked. the reads length was 120bp. the quality assessment was performed using ht_stat, which shows the reads quality in a series of charts that were described above in implementation. when quality assessment was done by base position, there was a gradual decrease of reads quality towards the 3’-end that can be observed in figure 1a and 1b. the tail trimming would be routinely applied to cut the low quality reads using the program ht_trim. in figure 1c, there was at least 10% of reads that have an invalid nucleotide sequence represented by contiguous ns. the bad reads that contained these ns can be filtered with the program ht_length_filter or ht_qual_filter. when the quality assessment was done by tiles, we observed tiles produced reads with very low quality that can be removed using ht_tile_filter. for the quality assessment of any paired-end reads, if the quality of read was worse than read such quality imbalance can be picked up by ht_stat. program run-time efficiency to compare the time cost of htqc with existing tools, quality assessment on the above dataset was performed using ht_stat, solexaqa version, fastqc version. and bigpre version. the benchmark was performed using a dell poweredge server with two amd opteron cpus. the server’s operation system was fedora linux for solexaqa, it by default only uses a part of the input sequences from each tile, thus we input the size of the test dataset as the tile sample size to ensure all reads were used. for bigpre, due to its inability to parse the newest version of header format produced by casava, or to work on quality records with “@” character, we modified its source code to allow it work properly with the test dataset. the solexaqa and the modified bigpre programs were executed using perl version. contained within the fedora linux system. the c++ source code of ht_stat was compiled using gnu gcc version. with optimization flag “-o2”. for the performance test of multiple threads, benchmarks for ht_stat and fastqc were carried out in two groups: one benchmark using worker thread, the other benchmark using worker threads. therefore, we have six benchmarks in total: one each for solexaqa and bigpre, two each for ht_stat and fastqc. all benchmarks were run times repeatedly to overcome any random disturbance of the computer system, and the amount of real time, system time and user time were recorded using the time command that is a part of the linux base system. when compared with the other two perl programs, both benchmarks of ht_stat used one order of magnitude fewer amount of user time, which showed the advantage of c++ language. the parallel comparison with fastqc, a java program, ht_stat was about three times faster in both single thread and three threads test. however, the higher amount of system time in our program shows the cost of the use of threads, which indicates our parallel processing model needs further improvements. when comparing the two benchmarks of ht_stat, the time cost of the three-threaded benchmark is only one third of the one-threaded benchmark, which indicates the efficiency of multiple threads. furthermore, there is no significant difference in the amount of user time and system time between 1-thread and 3-thread benchmarks of ht_stat, which indicates the use of more threads does not produce additional system cost.  the htqc tool kit provides convenient utilities for illumina sequencing qc. it can process sequencing data faster than the existing tools, and generates quality assessment report both in plain-text and graphical representation, which can help in making decisions about further reads filtration. the htqc package also provides four programs that can perform reads filtration using different methods. unlike previous tools in which only single filtration method is allowed, user can choose the method they prefer to remove the low quality reads, and combine several filtration methods in any order.

74," what evolutionary mechanisms are responsible for differences in the relative size of body parts among organisms? this basic question has long been confronted by biologists, for example, by j. s. huxley, in his problems of relative growth. when considering the tetrapod limb, one might ask why the forelimbs are relatively larger or smaller than the hindlimbs in some species, and how these differences have arisen during evolution. tetrapods exhibit great diversity in limb structures among species and in differences between fore- and hindlimbs within species, which typically are correlated with locomotor modes and life history. among mammals, the relatively large wings of an adult bat exhibit a striking contrast in size and proportions to its legs, whereas the disparity in most other living eutherians is more modest. kangaroos represent the opposite situation, having relatively massive hindlimbs. these differences are not restricted to mammals but characterize tetrapods as a whole, as evidenced when considering a bird or a frog or a turtle, or fossils such as tyranosaurus rex, which has huge hindlimbs and tiny forelimbs. a largely unanswered question is how these differences are reflected in the ontogenetic development of the limbs. limbs are one of the best studied systems in both evolution and development and display a sequence of well-defined temporal events, such as formation of the apical ectodermal ridge and the chondrification of skeletal elements. we examine here the extent to which features of early limb development, especially chondrogenesis, might be associated with obvious differences in forelimb and hindlimb size or function in the adult. we concentrate on heterochrony, the evolutionary change in developmental timing, a process which is thought to be important and common in evolution. in particular, we examine the relative timing of developmental events during ontogeny across the phylogeny of the species examined.  the average event-pair score was plotted for each species. the two anurans show average eps scores significantly less than one, indicating that hindlimb development generally precedes that of the forelimb. the two birds also tend to show an advance in hindlimb development – small differences between fore- and hindlimb timing can be detected visually – but are not significantly different from forelimb-hindlimb synchrony together with the remaining diapsids lacerta and emys. among mammals, the marsupials and eulipotyphlan insectivores all show significant advances in forelimb development. the generally smaller forelimb advances among the remaining eutherian mammals were not significantly different from synchronous development. the event-pair score may range from to. two-tailed student's t-tests were used to determine if the eps was significantly different from n is the number of stages of limb development identified and avg. stage is the mean number of events that occurred at each stage. an analysis of variance in combination with fisher's plsd test detected four major clades among the tetrapod species we examined: anuran amphibians: strong, significant hindlimb acceleration with an average eps of ±; diapsids: slight, but insignificant hindlimb acceleration with an average eps of ±; eutherian mammals: slight, but insignificant forelimb acceleration with an average eps of ±; marsupial mammals: strong, significant forelimb acceleration with an average eps of ±. discussion the relative timing of fore- and hindlimb development is labile in evolution, but with the observed pattern of change in timing showing a strong phylogenetic component. different clades each have evolved characteristic timing relationships that show no apparent correlation to the diverse lifestyles and adult morphologies of the species within each clade. the relative conservation of timing relationships within clades in the face of disparate adaptive needs is particularly striking among eutherians, which included a flying species, a glider, and a terrestrial species. although the eulipotyphlan insectivores erinaceus and talpa do show a significant forelimb advance within and with respect to other eutherian mammals, this pattern is also consistent for the clade despite the different locomotory modes of the exemplars. in short, the strong selection for modification of the adult limb morphology in eutherians did not produce correlated changes in the relative timing of forelimb-hindlimb development. the only exceptions to the general pattern of clade-dependent conservation across tetrapods that we are aware of occur in lissamphibians. in anurans, the limbs develop approximately in synchrony in rana temporaria in contrast to the hindlimb acceleration found in the two species we examined. among other lissamphibians, it is known that in some urodeles such as the smooth newt triturus vulgaris, the forelimb is so accelerated relative to the hindlimb that it is chondrified before the bud of the latter has even appeared. forelimb advanced over the hindlimb also characterizes the iberian ribbed newt pleurodeles watl. in other urodeles, such as the siberian newt salamandrella keyserlingii and the clawed salamander onychodactylus japonica, the forelimb is only marginally advanced if at all or, as in the mexican plethodontid chiropterotriton magnipes, the two limbs reportedly develop more or less simultaneously. increased species sampling may reveal yet additional variation within lissamphibia. altogether, there was little evidence that adaptations of the adult tetrapod limb were associated with fore-/hindlimb sequence heterochrony during chondrogenesis. instead, it appears that post-chondrogenic differences in growth rate play a more deciding role in shaping the final adult morphology of the tetrapod limb. a cogent example are marsupials, which often display a much larger hindlimb in adults despite the extreme acceleration of forelimb development in embryos. similarly, the bat actually displayed the least degree of forelimb acceleration among the eutherians studied, despite the forelimbs being greatly enlarged and modified as wings in the adult. this morphology appears to derive from allometric heterochrony instead: the initially conserved pattern of chondrogenesis is followed by accelerated chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, with increased bmp expression and bmp signalling. a similar phenomenon of allometric and not sequence heterochrony was hypothesized by jeffery et al. to account for eye development in the spectral tarsier, a nocturnal primate with the largest relative eye-size among mammals. an important question, therefore, is what is driving the changes in the early pattern of chondrogenesis among the major tetrapod clades, especially in light of the apparent conservation of this trait within most of them. similar developmental pathways are responsible for the patterning and growth of fore- and hindlimbs, and covariation between both has been recorded statistically at different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy in adults. yet, our study shows that heterochronic changes and dissociation have still occurred across major tetrapod clades and within lissamphibians to occasionally override the common mechanisms underlying limb development. one possible explanation for the inferred transformations is that the different patterns are directly adaptive for the embryo. this has been hypothesized for marsupials and monotremes, where the greatly accelerated forelimb development has been linked to the necessity for the embryo to climb to the mother's marsupium to attach to a teat for further development. similarly, marsupials show another one of the few, clear instances of sequence heterochrony in mammals, with many cranial structures associated with feeding in the pouch also showing advanced development. similar adaptive explanations are lacking for the remaining species, however. this is particularly true for the two anurans examined here, which show a conserved pattern despite their very different developmental modes. altogether, adaptive explanations seem difficult to postulate in general and for the amniotes in particular, the embryos of which develop in the protected environment of the cleidoic egg and so might be evolutionarily'privileged' and shielded from diversifying selection. an alternative, but not mutually exclusive, explanation is the presence of developmental'constraints' or that the overall pattern is the'by-product' of other developmental processes. although our findings are consistent with the existence of such constraints, they in no way can be taken as evidence of their existence. we would add that the general pattern of fore- and hindlimb developmental timing we present based on developmental landmarks belies its actual complexity. in dasyurus, for example, although the forelimb buds appear before those of the hindlimb, a clear hindlimb bud is present throughout most of forelimb development. however, chondrogenesis does not start in the hindlimb buds until forelimb development is nearly complete. the initial timing difference between the appearance of fore- and hindlimb buds correlates with the strong craniocaudal developmental gradient observed at early stages of development. however, the failure of the hindlimb bud to progress after its initial formation, is likely to be caused by more local factors, effectively maintaining a viable limb-bud whilst temporarily suspending outgrowth.  we find that the relative timing of forelimb versus hindlimb development varies widely between major vertebrate clades. however, such forelimb-hindlimb sequence heterochronies are largely absent within major clades, the lissamphibia forming a notable exception. the sequence differences that we did note between fore- and hindlimbs were not easy to explain in terms of morphological differences in the adult fore- and hindlimbs. rather, the latter were more likely explained by allometric growth differences. the apparently conservative nature of forelimb versus hindlimb timing may mean that of skeletal chondrogenesis sequences could provide useful phylogenetic characters at higher taxonomic levels in tetrapods. our data, and those summarized in rabl and richardson allow an initial attempt to reconstruct the evolution of forelimb-hindlimb heterochrony across tetrapods. the primitive tetrapod condition appears to be for the forelimb to be advanced over the hindlimb. this condition characterizes the primitive condition for the homologous structures in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes. thereafter, the evolution of this trait is equivocal, with two equally parsimonious solutions. one solution is for the forelimb advance to be retained ancestrally throughout tetrapods, with the individual groups independently deviating from this pattern. the other solution is for a hindlimb advance to be a shared derived feature of amniotes, with marsupials and eulipotyphlan insectivores independently regaining the primitive tetrapod hindlimb advance. additional data will help clarify this picture, both by testing the reality of the apparent clade-specificity of forelimb-hindlimb heterochrony and by hopefully resolving outstanding regions of uncertainty. key among the latter is within urodeles, where there is evidence that the pattern we present might not hold in unsampled species. "," tetrapods exhibit great diversity in limb structures among species and also between forelimbs and hindlimbs within species, diversity which frequently correlates with locomotor modes and life history. we aim to examine the potential relation of changes in developmental timing to the origin of limb morphological diversity in an explicit comparative and quantitative framework. in particular, we studied the relative time sequence of development of the forelimbs versus the hindlimbs in embryos of tetrapod species spanning a diverse taxonomic, ecomorphological and life-history breadth. whole-mounts and histological sections were used to code the appearance of developmental events comprising landmarks of development from the early bud stage to late chondrogenesis in the forelimb and the corresponding serial homologues in the hindlimb.  an overall pattern of change across tetrapods can be discerned and appears to be relatively clade-specific. in the primitive condition, as seen in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, the forelimb/pectoral fin develops earlier than the hindlimb/pelvic fin. this pattern is either retained or re-evolved in eulipotyphlan insectivores and taken to its extreme in marsupials. although exceptions are known, the two anurans we examined reversed the pattern and displayed a significant advance in hindlimb development. all other species examined, including a bat with its greatly enlarged forelimbs modified as wings in the adult, showed near synchrony in the development of the fore and hindlimbs.  major heterochronic changes in early limb development and chondrogenesis were absent within major clades except lissamphibia, and their presence across vertebrate phylogeny are not easily correlated with adaptive phenomena related to morphological differences in the adult fore- and hindlimbs. the apparently conservative nature of this trait means that changes in chondrogenetic patterns may serve as useful phylogenetic characters at higher taxonomic levels in tetrapods. our results highlight the more important role generally played by allometric heterochrony in this instance to shape adult morphology.

75," it is clear that sporadic colorectal cancer - as well as other cancers - is largely the product of acquired somatic mutations. though many of these mutations are functionally relevant to the tumor, the most well-studied cancer driver gene remains apc, thought to be the first hit in the majority of nonhereditary colon cancers. while apc is commonly known as an antagonist to β-catenin and wnt signaling, a growing body of evidence points to the importance of apc in a variety of other cellular contexts - from microtubule polymerization to cell migration. apc also plays important roles in chromosome segregation and stability, localizing to spindles, kinetochores, and centrosomes in mitosis. the myriad aspects of apc signaling may not be relevant in all cellular contexts, however, as signaling depends upon the background gene expression program and, in cancer biology, is often the result of multiple mutations. in fact, mouse models mutated at two driver genes simultaneously have shown a synergistic increase in tumor burden, such as in pten-apc, kras-tgfb, and apc-trp double mutants. such genetic synergy suggests that the pathways emanating from the two genes intersect downstream, supporting the idea that only a subset of all possible pathways are involved in a tumor harboring a mutation in apc. we hypothesize that these mutations have distinct synergistic effects on the cancer phenotype, such that the activities of these networks are greatly associated with the measured downstream changes in the proteome of the intestine. we argue that these measured molecular changes can be leveraged to elucidate which pathways are most relevant to the disease model at hand. in order to prioritize the various pathways associated with a cancer driver gene, we have developed a computational framework to first predict the set of pathways functionally related to apc signaling in mouse models. our algorithm mines chains of proteins from a protein-protein interaction network; these paths are then filtered by tissue-specific mrna coexpression and gene ontology annotation rule mining. to identify biologically relevant paths, we constrain our search space to pathways connected to previously identified cancer driver genes, as many of these pairings are expected to be simultaneously mutated. the set of paths linking apc to each can-gene comprises a subnetwork, which we refer to as a petal in the apc blossom. as each petal is based on in silico predictions, we then use publicly available functional genomic and proteomic data from the intestine of the apc1638n+/- mouse to assess the biological relevance of each petal in this mouse model. as proteins themselves are the mediators of cellular functions, we mapped proteome-level measurements identified through d differential in gel electrophoresis to each petal, using mrna-level coexpression to quantify the strength of the relationship. we chose to use 2d-dige - a widely used d gel electrophoresis based method - to illustrate our approach. however, our methods can utilize a variety of proteomics data, protein antibody chips etc.). though transcriptional activity does not strictly correlate with translational activity, coexpression information can still be helpful in uncovering regulatory hot spots in protein networks. testing each petal against such functional data correlates gene and protein expression readouts with specific driver gene relationships, thereby allowing the experimenter to identify the petal most likely to be operative in this particular mouse model.  in this paper, we present a method to capture the likely signaling pathways of a cancer driver gene, focusing on the signaling related to apc as an example. the initial set of pathway predictions are mined from protein-protein interaction networks, coupled to mrna coexpression data and gene ontology association rules. we refer to this data-mining process as the blossom algorithm, as it produces a network connecting a driver gene to a set of putative signaling partners, referred to as the apc blossom. the apc blossom is then pruned using biological evidence to identify a candidate petal, or subnetwork, most likely to be involved in apc signaling. the apc blossom: a petals network to study can-gene pathways operative in the apc1638n+/- mouse model, we used the blossom algorithm to identify pathways connecting apc to other can-genes. in summary, the blossom algorithm mines publicly available protein-protein interaction networks to uncover paths - i.e. chains of proteins - likely to be ""functional."" as evidence of a path's functionality, we use mrna coexpression and gene ontology association rules. as our current knowledge of molecular networks is incomplete, we use sequence homology to infer these missing data. the details of the blossom algorithm follow below. first, likely false positives from the underlying ppi network are filtered out. next, using this filtered ppi network, we were able to find paths linking apc to of the can-genes, forming subnetworks, which we refer to as petals. after imputing interaction edges using sequence homology, this number was increased to however, filtering out paths whose average mrna coexpression was low and support of go annotation association rules based on known signaling pathways and functional annotations was weak, the number of apc-can-gene petals was reduced to. the petals identified vary in the number of nodes and edges they contain, with some nodes beings shared among multiple petals. a blossom can be constructed for a wide variety of genes, with the stipulation that corresponding microarray data is available. in our case study of apc, we employ mrna expression data from intestinal tumors harvested from apcmin/+ mice. as multiple mutations are present in these samples, coexpression measurements calculated for this dataset are representative of the tumor microenvironment; as such, both apc signaling, as well as additional can-gene signaling, are likely to be active simultaneously. while the presence of these multiple, active pathways increases the signal associated with cross-talk within in each petal, it does not allow us to determine which pathways are most strongly associated with apc signaling alone. to answer this question, as outlined in the next section, we used mice with a particular heterozygous mutation in apc - 1638n - that results in a mild intestinal cancer phenotype, thereby minimizing the noise arising from the many pathways activated in a full-blown tumor. since we are interested in assessing the systems-level effects of such mutations, we focus on measuring the downstream effects of these genes via'omic experiments. plucking petals: testing the bimodality of coexpression the apc1638n+/- mouse model represents a perturbation of the stamen in the apc blossom, and such a perturbation is expected to have far-reaching molecular effects. this was supported by the 2d-dige proteomic experiments that identified proteins with a variety of cellular functions from the intestinal epithelium of compared to wild-type. we hypothesized that if one of the petals in the blossom truly reveals signaling associated with this mutation of apc, then the nodes of this petal are more likely to associate with the 2d-dige targets than a random group of proteins. to gauge this association, we used a map of coexpression compiled from the corresponding apc1638n+/- intestinal epithelium mrna-expression profile. assuming that the signaling molecules in a petal are upstream of the 2d-dige targets, strong coexpression between a petal and the 2d-dige targets can help to identify the causative signaling events that led to these measured changes in abundance of the proteome. since coexpression is most informative when it relates to differentially expressed nodes, we modulated the coexpression values associated with the nodes in each petal by their respective levels of differential expression. this allows for the identification of nodes where any individual node may have a low level of expression, but the collective level of expression across nodes may be high. we further posited that, if a group of proteins truly is coregulated, then we expect to see deviations in the tails of the coexpression distribution when compared to the expected distribution. to gauge this deviation, we introduced the bimodality, β, of coexpression: a measure based on the mass of the cumulative distribution functions' and the distance of the mass from the origin. this allowed us to prioritize the petals by their respective p-values and the top three petals are shown in figure. in figure the 2d-dige targets are shown on the periphery of the petal, ranked by their degree of absolute coexpression. this representation also facilitates the prioritization of 2d-dige targets, placing emphasis on those targets whose regulation is supported by multiple elements of the candidate petal. much of the coregulation can be explained by a few key signaling intermediates - notably, tgfb which has both a high level of differential expression, as well as strong coexpression links. signaling molecules like tgfb are hypothesized to lie upstream of'omics measurements, and, thus, the petal at the heart of figure represents a potential set of intermediaries by which the signal arising from a mutation in apc blossoms into proteome-level manifestations.  to understand how a mutation affects information flow in a tumor, one must consider both the proximal and distal signaling effects. proximally, a mutation in a gene may result in a truncated protein product that affects physical interactions, or it may result in a hyperphosphorylated and active state. these small, upstream effects are then amplified and result in distal changes in signaling, affecting mrna and protein levels of tens to hundreds of seemingly unrelated nodes. while the field of cell signaling is adept at dissecting the proximal effects of a mutation - mechanistically mapping out perturbed pathways - it has not yet developed the tools to fully understand the distal effects and, more importantly, their connection with more proximal signaling. indeed, currently available commercial software for network analysis can only associate these distal effects amongst themselves, with no regard to the upstream causative mutation. in this study, we present a method by which the distal effects measured in two'omics experiments - microarray and proteomics - can be simultaneously leveraged to test network-based hypotheses. after testing the hypotheses against proteomic evidence, the refined petal subnetworks we present not only reveal the relationship between upstream genetic interference and its downstream effects at the proteomics level, but also allow us to prioritize other cancer-driver genes that are likely to act cooperatively with apc to drive tumorigenesis. this new approach - linking in silico predictions with experimental measurements - provides a way forward in mining context-specific pathways that may prove to be useful in identifying pathways active in individual cancer patients. "," colon cancer is driven by mutations in a number of genes, the most notorious of which is apc. though much of apc's signaling has been mechanistically identified over the years, it is not always clear which functions or interactions are operative in a particular tumor. this is confounded by the presence of mutations in a number of other putative cancer driver genes, which often synergize with mutations in apc. computational methods are, thus, required to predict which pathways are likely to be operative when a particular mutation in apc is observed.  we developed a pipeline, petals, to predict and test likely signaling pathways connecting apc to other can-genes, where the interaction network originating at apc is defined as a ""blossom,"" with each apc-can-gene subnetwork referred to as a ""petal."" known and predicted protein interactions are used to identify an apc blossom with petals. then, using a novel measure of bimodality, the coexpression of each petal is evaluated against proteomic measurements from the apc1638n+/-mouse to test the network-based hypotheses.  the predicted pathways linking apc and hapln exhibited the highest amount of bimodal coexpression with the proteomic targets, prioritizing the apc-hapln petal over other can-gene pairs and suggesting that this petal may be involved in regulating the observed proteome-level effects. these results not only demonstrate how functional'omics data can be employed to test in silico predictions of can-gene pathways, but also reveal an approach to integrate models of upstream genetic interference with measured, downstream effects.

76," colostrum is vital food for the newborn of all mammals within the first 5- days after parturition. colostrum contains various nutrients as well as many biologically active substances such as immunoglobulins, antimicrobial factors, growth factors and others. the quality of colostrum has a strong relationship with colostral immunoglobulin level. the most abundant cil in the ruminants' colostrum is the igg, followed by igm and iga. calves are born without blood immunoglobulins, so they depend on their mother's colostrum in order to obtain immunity. transference of passive immunity throughout the colostrum is essential for the calf's health and survival during its first days of life. because colostrum is very important to the newborn, producers must often make provision to have a source of colostrum available if and when the dam does not provide enough high quality colostrum for the calf. in addition, numerous studies suggest that oral administration of bovine colostrum preparations may contribute to human health care both as part of a health promoting diet and as an alternative or supplement to the medical treatment of specified human diseases. the colostrum composition and its quality are influenced by a variety of factors, including maternal age, parity, breed, nutritional status, season, premature parturition, premature lactation, colostral handling factors, induction of parturition and health status. during transition from colostrum to normal milk, gradual or sometimes sudden changes may occur in composition and properties. knowing the composition and physical properties of colostrum and post-colostrum secretions will help establish when such milk is suitable for processing and determine the best use for that milk. several studies have evaluated the changes in the chemical composition of cow colostrum after parturition, but there is not available information about buffalo colostrum which represents approximately 49% of lactating ruminants in egypt. so, the aim of this study was to follow the changes in colostrum composition of egyptian buffaloes and holstein cows after parturition. methods animals and management egyptian buffaloes and holstein cows were selected from open nucleus herd from cattle information system of egypt and technology centre of agricultural production, faculty of agriculture, cairo university. all animals were in the second lactation and their milk production level in the first lactation was kg/parity for buffalo and kg/parity for cow. they fed clover misqawi, rice straw and concentrate, and housed in free stalls. this study was approved by the university of cairo animal care committee. collection of colostrum samples colostrum samples from buffaloes and cows were collected during the winter seasons of and 2011;

77," large-scale protein interaction network data have now been collected in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. it has been suggested that these networks provide an integrative perspective on cellular processes and considerable effort has been invested into their functional and evolutionary analysis. at the moment molecular network data sets are still plagued by noise – this is especially true for protein interaction networks – and incompleteness, but nevertheless considerable progress is being made in the analysis of complex cellular phenotypes in light of such networks. below we will introduce an novel method for the construction of confidence intervals for network quantities. this new approach is able to fuse different lines of biological information and generate conditional confidence intervals; these can be applied as an alternative we can employ it in addition to demonstrate it in an analysis of the saccaromyces cerevisiae pin. a number of studies have investigated whether characteristics of interacting proteins are more similar than those of proteins for which no interaction has been reported, and how the network structure affects properties – such as the evolutionary rate – of interacting genes or proteins. other studies have looked at structural properties, such as network motifs. because of the dependence introduced by the network it is, however, not possible to use the conventional confidence measures, e.g. for the correlation coefficient of some property of pairs of interacting proteins. rather, a network-aware null model has to be used which compares the actual network with some suitably randomized version of it. in order to incorporate network aspects these studies have used either straightforward bootstrapping of nodes in order to create random pairs of nodes, bootstrapped nodes based on their degree, or randomly rewired the network while keeping the degree of each node fixed. the first approach has been shown to underestimate the size of the confidence intervals, while the second and third yield statistically similar results ) for measures of pair-wise similarity of the properties of interacting nodes. in order to assess the cis for motifs, however, an explicit incorporation of the network is generally necessary and only the third approach can be used. all of these three approaches above rely, however, implicitly on the assumption that the network is uniform and not structured in any particular way. such procedures also ignore any other information that is increasingly becoming available for many species, and which may affect the organization of the network. while bootstrap or rewiring approaches are parsimonious – and undoubtedly should be preferred for general cases where no other information is available – it opens up the question as to whether such approaches are still satisfactory when additional, potentially co-variate, data is available. here we provide statistical tools for incorporating such additional information into the statistical analysis. using such information can have considerable effect on the construction of network confidence intervals, and our procedure, gocardshuffle, constructs randomly rewired instances of networks that incorporate the degree sequence exactly, and additional information statistically. thus, for example, if in a given protein interaction dataset, proteins in the mitochondria interact predominantly with other mitochondrial proteins but not at all with proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, then gocardshuffle will construct only instances of randomly rewired networks which reflect the relative importance of intra-category versus inter-category connections. in addition to go annotations, any other biological annotation may act as confounding variables, e.g. when expression levels differ between categories. there is a rich statistical literature on confounding variables and their role in the statistical interpretation of primary effects. scenarios, where the effects of known or unknown confounding variables result in inconsistencies unless properly accounted for, are known as examples of simpson's paradox in statistics. on a much more subtle scale there will undoubtedly be confounding variables in many of the processes studied in systems biology. these, at least in principle, can be accounted for in a framework such as gocardshuffle; if the approach is used in addition to random rewiring then it may be possible to detect such potentially confounding hidden variables.  here we illustrate the use of gocardshuffle by contrasting statistical confidence intervals obtained under different null models for network rewiring. correlation of node properties in both cases, however, we notice that the full annotation as used in gocardshuffle results in distributions of correlation values that cover the observed value of the correlation. thus, once the rewired network instances are conditioned on go annotations the observed correlation appear to be covered by the new, conditioned null model. in figure in additional file we show that the effects of conditioning on presently available functional information in the context of presently available protein interaction data does result in a shift of the distribution obtained under the null model away from zero to finite positive values. depending on the dataset and correlation measure, however, the gocardshuffle histogram may not overlap the observed value. quite generally, we expect that conditioning such analyses on additional available data will result in a shift in the expected null distribution if such data does explain some aspects of the variability in the measures to be correlated. that is, we observe the shift in the null distributions, precisely because some of the variation in evolutionary rate and mrna expression levels are captured by go annotations. network motifs in order to illustrate the use of gocardshuffle on motif-analysis we counted the numbers of each possible motif of size four present in the original protein interaction network and in each of the rewired networks. the statistical significance of motifs is assessed by their z scores. for the simple null model, and the gocardshuffle null model using all three annotation categories, these are shown in figure changing the null model against which significance is assessed naturally changes the observed z-scores of the motifs. perhaps the most interesting result is that the relative excess of the fully connected motif in the true network compared to the ""random networks"" decreases as the annotations are taken into account. another way of looking at this is that incorporating the coarse structure of the pin cannot account for the local network patterns across the network. discussion we have shown that it is possible to condition the rewiring process by which confidence intervals on networks are constructed on biological information such as gene ontology data. integrating such known biological information into the statistical analysis of protein interaction network data may result in changes to the null model if such data is correlated with network organization. we demonstrated the effect of conditioning on go data by analyzing the correlations among interacting proteins: several studies had reported that properties of interacting proteins are significantly more similar than those of non-interacting proteins. applying gocardshuffle to yeast pin data and conditioning on different combinations of go categories suggests that this may at least partially be because the protein interaction networks of real biological organisms are inhomogeneous and show a level of local and functional organization, which has been ignored in previous statistical analyses. in light of the conditional null models, however, the similarity of evolutionary rates and expression levels of interacting proteins in the yeast pin dataset used here, is just as would be expected for a network with the same biological characteristics. since these protein characteristics differ between different categories – even if sometimes only slightly – and since within-category interactions are more frequent than between category interactions, similarity of properties of interacting proteins are readily understood. presently go annotations have to be treated with some care and caution. there is the danger of circular arguments if in-silico annotations are used. as we outline in the methods section uncertainties and different levels of support for different annotations are straightforwardly incorporated into the gocardshuffle algorithm. the source code of the python and r routines of the implementation of gocardshuffle are available from the authors' website.  our novel network resampling approach allows the construction of confidence intervals under a statistical null model of network organization which conditions on available biological information. if used in addition to conventional rewiring procedures then this approach can be used to detect potentially confounding hidden variables or relationships in systems biology data. gocardshuffle allows the refinement of the statistical null model for network structure based on available biological data: the rewired network instances may now capture probabilistically the modular aspects of these molecular networks. this appears to be the case for go annotations of yeast proteins, and as we have shown, such stratification of the network – where within-category interactions are more frequent than between-category interactions – may lead to correlations among properties of interacting proteins. once this has been accounted for, there is no strong additional evidence for interacting proteins to be more similar than would be expected by chance. the present approach is readily extended to include other information on functional and structural properties of the network. quite generally, gocardshuffle, can be applied in the statistical analysis of coloured graph problems. "," in the analysis of networks we frequently require the statistical significance of some network statistic, such as measures of similarity for the properties of interacting nodes. the structure of the network may introduce dependencies among the nodes and it will in general be necessary to account for these dependencies in the statistical analysis. to this end we require some form of null model of the network: generally rewired replicates of the network are generated which preserve only the degree of each node. we show that this can fail to capture important features of network structure, and may result in unrealistic significance levels, when potentially confounding additional information is available. methods we present a new network resampling null model which takes into account the degree sequence as well as available biological annotations. using gene ontology information as an illustration we show how this information can be accounted for in the resampling approach, and the impact such information has on the assessment of statistical significance of correlations and motif-abundances in the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction network. an algorithm, gocardshuffle, is introduced to allow for the efficient construction of an improved null model for network data.  we use the protein interaction network of s. cerevisiae; correlations between the evolutionary rates and expression levels of interacting proteins and their statistical significance were assessed for null models which condition on different aspects of the available data. the novel gocardshuffle approach results in a null model for annotated network data which appears better to describe the properties of real biological networks.  an improved statistical approach for the statistical analysis of biological network data, which conditions on the available biological information, leads to qualitatively different results compared to approaches which ignore such annotations. in particular we demonstrate the effects of the biological organization of the network can be sufficient to explain the observed similarity of interacting proteins.

78," it is well known that the teflon event involving the dupont company of usa drew serious international attention to perfluorooctanoic acid; pfoa is formed from the raw materials used in the production of teflon-lined non-stick cooking appliances. fluoropolymers such as teflon have very good performances e.g. as fire retardants and for oil and fat resistance; their byproducts such as pfoa can be formed by cooking, burning and environmental degradation. pfoa is still widely used in basic processes in the aviation, automobile, building materials, chemicals, electronic, semiconductor and textile industries. it is persistent and non-biodegradable and becomes widely distributed in nature, e.g. water, biological bodies, human tissues and foods. it can certainly enter the gastrointestinal tract via the intake of foods and water and then it is absorbed and permeates into the blood and various tissues. sampling studies have revealed the presence of pfoa in the bloods of over 90% of us residents. it may have serious effects on the endocrine, immune and nervous systems and it can be delivered to the fetus through the umbilical cord and can accumulate. it can also cause cancers of the liver, testis, pancreatic and mammary glands, and can lead to embryonic deformities and other diseases. in recent years, pfoa has become a significant issue in many aspects of environmental ecology, toxicology, pathology and life sciences. human serum albumin is a major protein component of blood plasma but is also found in the interstitial fluid of body tissues. in mammals, albumin is synthesized by the liver and has a half-life of days in the circulation. it is the major contributor to the oncotic pressure of the blood plasma. it is called a multifunctional plasma carrier protein because of its ability to bind an unusually broad spectrum of ligands e.g. inorganic ions, various drugs, amino acids, fatty acids, etc. binding to hsa facilitates their transport throughout the circulation. without doubt, interaction of any toxicant with hsa influences the transport of nutrients and drugs. recently, studies have been conducted on the binding of organic contaminants or toxins to hsa e.g. arazine, ochratoxin, methyl parathion and arsenic. bindings of pfoa to biomacromolecular such as rat and human plasma proteins, rat liver-form and kidney-form alpha 2u-globulins, have been investigated at room temperature. the interaction of organic contaminants and hsa is always affected by various environmental conditions such as ph, strength and temperature. in this work, we investigated the interaction of pfoa with hsa by equilibrium dialysis, fluorospectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry and circular dichroism under normal physiological condition, ph and m electrolyte and 37°c. the object is to analyze the interaction forces, sites and type and then further understand the toxigenicity of pfoa.  equilibrium dialysis of pfoa the equilibrium dialysis method was used to investigate the interaction of pfoa with hsa. the pfoa concentration in the dialysis solution was measured at 37°c at various dialysis times with no protein in the membrane. the pfoa dialysis rate approaches 90% at h and exceeds 98% after h. pfoa passes freely through the semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium reached. hsa solution was put into the dialysis membrane as dialysate instead of pfoa, but it was found only in the dialysis bag. therefore, the equilibrium dialysis is suitable for investigating the interaction of pfoa with hsa. the dialysis solution was sampled and measured spectrophotometrically to determine the pfoa concentration after more than h of dialysis. characterization of the interactions of pfoa with hsa the interaction of pfoa with hsa is summarized as follows: both cl and cm are the initial mole concentrations of pfoa and hsa, cl is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa described above. n is the saturation binding number of pfoa. the effective fraction of pfoa bound to hsa and its molar binding ratio are calculated by the relations: f = 1-cl/cl and γ = fcl0/cm the γ value will approach n with increasing pfoa. in fact, ph varies widely among normal tissues in the human body. for example, less than ph in gastric fluid, ph in liver and saliva, ph – on the skin and around ph in blood and intestinal tract. normal human temperature is 37°c and the electrolyte concentration is between and %. in this present work, the experiments were conducted in m nacl at ph at 37°c. by measuring a series of pfoa solutions containing known concentrations of hsa at ph, the f and γ values were calculated according to the above equations. the f decreases linearly with increasing pfoa concentration from curve in fig. but γ increases from curve the binding of pfoa approaches to a constant maximum at when cl0/cm is more than from curve the number of amino acid residues positively charged e.g. lys, his and arg is in hsa, which is no correlation with such an n value. different from a sulfonic azo ligand, the pfoa binding to hsa doesn't results from ion-pair attraction. strong intermolecular forces e.g. hydrogen bond, van der waals forces and hydrophobic interaction may be involved. the temkin isothermal model, was used to fit the above experimental data. from curve, the interaction of pfoa with hsa corresponds to chemical monolayer adsorption. both Δq and ka were calculated to be - kj/mol and × m- the adsorption of pfoa on hsa is exothermic and non-covalent, i.e. no strong bond was formed between pfoa and hsa. in order to understand the mechanism of pfoa-hsa binding, some detailed thermodynamic data are needed. the itc measurement may provide information on thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy and heat capacity changes during the molecular interaction directly from the heat produced by the reaction, and have been used to study, for example, protein interactions, dna triplex formation and hiv protease activity. fig. 3a depicts a typical isothermal titration profile obtained by injecting pfoa into the itc cell containing hsa. the resulting values were plotted as a function of cl0/cm and fitted to a two-step sequential binding model by a nonlinear least squares method. values for the equilibrium constant, enthalpy change and entropy change of the pfoa-hsa reaction were obtained and calculated by the gibbs free energy equation: Δg = -rtlnkb = Δh-tΔ s. the thermodynamic parameters derived from this curve are summarized in table because both Δhi values are much less than kcal/mol, the non-covalent binding of pfoa to hsa is confirmed. pfoa is more lipophilic in aqueous solution and it decreased obviously the aqueous surface intensity. fifteen electrophilic f-groups in pfoa can attract strongly the lone pair electrons of polar side groups of peptide chain, e.g. f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding. hsa is consisted of three homologous all α-helical domains, each divided into two subdomains. all the helixic subdomains are distributed round a hydrophobic intracavity and the hydrophilic side groups of hsa exposed on the outer surface. in the first step, only one pfoa molecule bound on hsa. the f of pfoa is always more than 90% from curve in fig. when the cl0/cm is less than therefore, the first step is complete at approximately of cl0/cm hsa binding pfoa caused the entropy decreasing in this step. the refolding of hsa occurred by resuming the released heat. from Δg value, the pfoa-hsa reaction is spontaneous. moreover, the higher kb, value indicated that the binding of the first pfoa molecule to hsa is firmer. from curve to in fig. the blue shift of peak emission wavelength from to nm indicated that the static quench of the hsa's intrinsic fluorescence occurred in the presence of pfoa, specially obviously when cl0/cm is less than thus, the first pfoa molecule may bind to the side group of tyr. as a result, the deformable linear pfoa may insert into the hydrophobic intracavity of hsa and bridge between subdomains iia and iib across trp by f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding with the polar side groups of asn, gln, asp, glu, arg, his, tyr and trp and hydrophobic interaction with the non-polar side groups, e.g. val, leu, met, ala and ile. the first step binding of pfoa to hsa is similar to that of long chain fatty acids to hsa. besides a long carbon chain, pfoa has strong extensibility on interface of water – particles so that it may spread on the exposed outer surface of hsa. when cl0/cm is more than pfoa began to bind on the hydrophilic surface of hsa till a saturation via the polar bonds e.g. ionic interaction, hydrogen bond and f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding. by comparison of n obtained by equilibrium dialysis and that obtained by itc, two methods achieves the same result. from the higher Δh value, the binding sites of pfoa may bridge between any two helixes all over the outer surface of hsa. from Δg value, the pfoa-hsa reaction is spontaneous. in the 2nd step, the binding of pfoa to hsa caused an obvious entropy decreasing, i.e. more negative Δs, the hsa structure changed refolding. by comparison of the emission spectra in fig. the obvious blue shift of peak wavelength was found when cl0/cm is more than this indicates an obvious change of hsa conformation, too. as a result, the interaction of pfoa with hsa is assignable under normal physiological condition. in addition, the β-pleated sheet content of hsa decreased obviously and its α-helix increased by 15% in the presence of pfoa from the change of cd spectra of hsa. thus, the second step in pfoa binding changed a substantial part of the β-pleated sheet of hsa into α-helix form. without doubt, such a binding would cause a great change of hsa structure and affect the function of hsa in blood.  the current work investigated the interaction of pfoa with hsa in the normal physiological acidities of blood and intestinal tract tissue where pfoa molecules may be present. the interaction of pfoa with hsa accorded with the langmuir isothermal model in two-step sequence, in which only one pfoa molecule entered the hydrophobic intracavity in the first step and pfoa molecules binding on the hydrophilic outer surface in the second step. the interaction of pfoa and hsa is spontaneous and the non-covalent bond results in change of hsa conformation. the possible binding sites were also speculated. the present work proposed a determination and characterization method for the intermolecular weak interaction. if combined further with the other experiments e.g. biomolecular function effect, cell membrane transport of contaminant and toxicological testing, it is more helpful for elucidating the toxigenicity of perfluorochemicals.

79," potato virus x, a potexvirus, is a filamentous rod-shaped virus which contains a single plus-sense rna molecule. the rna is capped, polyadenylated, and encodes five open reading frames. pvx was designed to express foreign genes. its coat promoter was duplicated in the vector to drive the foreign orf transcription. the pvx vector has been used to express foreign genes in many host plants, in translation studies, and for investigating gene silencing. in the current study, the pvx vector was used to express the gp gene of bvdv singer strain and vp of cpv- for vaccine development in a plant vector. the construction of the pvx vector required the new plasmid to be amplified in e. coli before inoculating plants, which would be necessary to construct a plant virus vectored viral genes for a vaccine for these two viruses. in molecular cloning, plasmids need to be amplified in e. coli to produce enough plasmid dna for molecular manipulation. the foreign gene in the expression vectors is not expressed until it is in a eukaryotic host cell; thus, it was surprising to find, when the plasmid was amplified in e. coli, the foreign gene was expressed and it killed the bacteria. cryptic promoter is the promoter homologous sequence that distribute randomly. it was previously reported that there was a cryptic promoter associated with a toxic gene in potato virus y that interrupted cloning work in e. coli. the cryptic promoter in pvx has not been reported before. when the eukaryotic expression vectors are derived from viruses, certain viral sequences might be recognized as promoter elements. we tried to sub-clone two animal viral genes into the pvx vector; however, only the gp orf from bvdv was successfully sub-cloned. the other gene, the cpv- vp could not be sub-cloned into the pvx vector, probably because it was toxic to e. coli when expressed. if vp had not been expressed in e. coli, the cloning would have been possible and the cryptic promoter in the pvx vector would not have been found, as occurred when the gp orf was sub-cloned in the pvx vector and transcribed. the transcription initiation site was determined with rt-pcr. the cryptic promoter activity from pvx was compared with that of the t promoter with real-time rt-pcr.  comparison of the pvx cryptic promoter with the conserved prokaryotic promoter the similarity of the end element of the triple block sequences in pvx and the prokaryotic conserved sequence of - and - were compared. the conserved promoter sequences of prokaryotic organisms are - tataat and - ttgaca, separated by 16– base pairs. the prokaryotic homologous element in the pvx vector matched over 50% of the prokaryotic conserved promoter sequence. the homologous element was considered as the cryptic promoter sequence and it was hypothesized to drive the transcription of foreign genes. transcription of foreign genes driven by the cryptic promoter on the pvx vector both the bvdv gp and the cvp- vp foreign genes were sub-cloned into the pvx vector. however, only the gp orf in the plasmid could be expressed. in the pvx vector, the cloned vp fragment always had a mutation near the start codon. we hypothesized that there was a cryptic promoter driving the foreign gene to be transcribed, which lead to expression of a toxic vp protein that killed the e. coli during plasmid amplification. in order to demonstrate the existence of cryptic promoter, e. coli was transformed with the pvx vector, pgr106gp plasmid. after a four hour culture, the total rna was isolated. northern blots showed the foreign gene gp was transcribed. with the gp specific probe in northern blots, the pgr106gp transformed e. coli showing a band of about kb; whereas, the plasmid pgr106-transformed e. coli did not. this suggests that cryptic promoter activity existed. determination of the site of transcription initiation if the hypothesis regarding the cryptic promoter position was correct, the gp rna in e. coli should have a 5' untranslated region from the pvx vector. based on the sequence behind the cryptic promoter, three different primers in front of the gp orf and an antisense primer from gp sequence were designed to run rt-pcr. only primer could amplify the cdna of gp the 5'utr is about base pairs long. a negative control plasmid transformed e. coli, did not have any pcr product, using gp specific primer. the mrna control showed that the rna was not contaminated with plasmid dna because no dna fragment was amplified. this demonstrated that transcription was initiated at approximately base pairs downstream of the cryptic promoter. comparison of the cryptic promoter with the t promoter using real-time rt-pcr the activity of both the cryptic promoter and t promoter were compared using real-time rt-pcr. this method uses mathematical formulas to calculate relative expression levels compared to a calibrator. the amount of target gene expression is also normalized to an endogenous housekeeping gene, in this case, 16s rrna. the cryptic promoter activity was significantly higher than that of the t promoter.  even though the cryptic promoter sequence did not perfectly match the conserved prokaryotic - and - elements, it matched 50% and 66%, respectively. it has been reported that certain foreign elements can be recognized as a promoter by e. coli. promoter homologous sequences are widely distributed in the genomic sequence of e. coli. cryptic promoters are those sequences that are promoter homologous sequences driving transcription. the cryptic sequences might also interrupt expressions of foreign genes in plants. an example is that the homologous intron sequence within a gene can also interrupt expression of foreign gene. in the current study, a prokaryotic cryptic promoter drove transcription during plasmid amplification. the sequence of the cryptic promoter in pvx is different from that in pvy. the interruption was different because the toxic gene is not from the virus itself as in pvy but from the foreign gene. cryptic promoters in eukaryotic cells can have different functions, such as increased enzyme expression; tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific gene expression. a reporter gene, such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase when sub-cloned behind different promoters could be used to compare the promoter activity. the enzyme expression driven by promoters can reflect the promoters' activities. however, with real-time rt-pcr, the transcribed rna could be used as an indicator to show the promoter activity. with real time rt-pcr, the cryptic promoter activity was compared with that of t promoter, an inducible promoter. although the pvx vector is an expression vector in plants, it needs to be amplified in e. coli for molecular manipulation. during the dna amplifying stage, the foreign genes should not be expressed; however, the foreign genes in the pvx vector were transcribed. if vp were not toxic to bacteria its transcription would not influence the cloning work. the failure to sub-clone the vp cistron, suggested that vp was toxic to bacteria. the toxic pressure prevented the non-mutated vp from being sub-cloned into the pvx vector. a number of plant viruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus and pvx, have been reported to contain mrna regions that possess a high degree of homology to both chloroplast rrna and prokaryotic 16s rna, which are closely related. it has been demonstrated that a triple block sequence located upstream from the coat protein gene of pvx facilitated the translation of the pokeweed antiviral protein gene in e. coli. even though unexpected expression of a foreign gene can interrupt downstream cloning work, the cryptic promoter makes the pvx vector an expression vector in e. coli, able to express foreign genes in both e. coli and plants. this ability to express foreign genes either in a prokaryotic organism or a eukaryotic organism makes the pvx vector a potential useful tool to study the differences in transcription and translation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms without changing the vector. "," potato virus x has been developed into an expression vector for plants. it is widely used to express foreign genes. in molecular manipulation, the foreign genes need to be sub-cloned into the vector. the constructed plasmid needs to be amplified. usually, during amplification stage, the foreign genes are not expressed. however, if the foreign gene is expressed, the construction work could be interrupted. two different viral genes were sub-cloned into the vector, but only one foreign gene was successfully sub-cloned. the other foreign gene, canine parvovirus type vp could not be sub-cloned into the vector and amplified without mutation.  a cryptic promoter in the pvx vector was discovered with rt-pcr. the promoter activity was studied with northern blots and real-time rt-pcr.  it is important to recognize the homologous promoter sequences in the vector when a virus is developed as an expression vector. during the plasmid amplification stage, an unexpected expression of the cpv- vp gene can interrupt the downstream work.

80," metabolomic profiling in general aims to identify or confirm biomarkers that are represented by specific metabolite intensity profiles in the context of different physiological and/or experimental conditions. these conditions may represent different phenotypes of a species, disease or environmental and genetic perturbations, or a time course comparing different developmental or physiological stages of an organism. high-throughput analytical measurements, as obtained from mass spectrometry experiments, provide a large number of intensity profiles for accumulation of different metabolites. these data sets show an even higher complexity when repeated measurements for each condition have been performed. for an interpretation based on the experimental conditions these replicas need to be aggregated using e.g. the corresponding mean or median value. for comparative analysis of relative metabolite concentrations it is usually necessary to normalize the resulting intensity vectors, e.g according to a unit euclidean or ""city block"" norm. in the following, the aggregated and normalized multivariate intensity profiles are referred to as marker candidates. clustering is a well-established technique in the context of gene expression analysis and coexpression studies. intensity-based clustering by analogy aims to group similar intensity profiles in order to identify interesting groups of marker candidates and visualize them in a convenient way. a major problem with the application of clustering algorithms is that an adequate number of clusters can often not be inferred automatically. a purely data-driven approach always bears the risk of over- or under-clustering because the correct number of clusters usually depends on task-specific constraints. one-dimensional self-organizing maps realize a linear array of prototypes that correspond to local averages of the data, ordered according to their similarity. in metabolomic analysis the visualization of ordered prototypes provides a quick overview on relevant intensity patterns in the data and allows to easily merge neighboring groups of marker candidates into meaningful clusters. for example, in we detected a significant number of clusters representing different physiological stages during a plant wounding time course as described in. the 1d-som realizes a robust and reproducible ordering in particular with regard to changing data quality. unlike the classical two-dimensional self-organizing maps, which are utilized in a number of software tools for gene expression analysis and metabolomics, 1d-soms allow a simultaneous visualization of the clustering and the underlying intensity profiles by means of the topologically ordered prototype array. this visualization corresponds to a two-dimensional color-coded matrix, where the first dimension represents the prototype order and the second dimension represents the experimental conditions. while 2d-soms can be used to visualize the two-dimensional variation in a single condition, 1d-soms provide a complete view on the one-dimensional variation in all conditions simultaneously. therefore, 1d-soms provide a convenient overview of highly complex metabolomic data sets. beside a number of general software packages, like the well-known som toolbox or the ""clustering for business analytics"" and som packages for the r-project, several more specific tools provide functions to order and visualize multivariate intensity profiles along a one-dimensional array. though, none of them provides a specialized interface for convenient 1d-som visualization and analysis of metabolomics data. in the following, we introduce the marvis tool, which implements the concept of 1d-som clustering and visualization. based on an example workflow, the functionality and utility of marvis is demonstrated. implementation marvis was written in the matlab® programming language and has been compiled for microsoft® windows xp/vista and linux x execution of the software requires installation of the matlab® compiler runtime, which is provided with marvis. the installation packages and the documentation can be downloaded from the project home page. for data import and export marvis uses the csv file format, which can easily be processed by statistical analysis software and spreadsheet applications. besides data set meta information and customizable headers, a csv file for use with marvis consists of marker candidate-specific lines. each line contains data fields with intensity measurements for all conditions and replicas. by default, marvis performs an aggregation of repeated measurements for each condition using the corresponding mean or median value. the resulting intensity vectors are normalized before clustering using the euclidean or ""city block"" norm or a z-score transformation. if alternatively normalized intensity profiles should be used for clustering, these user-normalized profiles can be stored as additional data in the csv file. it is also possible to store additional marker candidate properties, which are displayed by marvis as text. for high-contrast visualization of prototype and marker candidate profiles marvis uses customizable colormaps, which map original and normalized intensity values to a broad color spectrum. the colormapping for original and normalized intensities is calculated independently according to the respective minimum and maximum intensity values.  in the following, the functionality of marvis is demonstrated on the basis of a metabolomic case study of a plant wounding experiment analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with an orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer as described before in. the data set contains marker candidates for the wound response of the thale cress arabidopsis thaliana under conditions. the first four conditions reflect the metabolic situation within a wounding time course of wild type plants starting with the control plants followed by the plants harvested, and hours post wounding. the conditions to represent the same time course for the jasmonate deficient mutant plant dde 2-. each condition contains replica samples. the corresponding data set is supplied with the marvis tool as a csv file. file import the data set is imported using the open for clustering entry in the file menu. after choosing the input file, marvis displays the import dialog, where the delimiter character, the start row and column of the header, the number of conditions, and the number of samples for each condition are specified. in this example, we use the mean intensity value for aggregation of replicas and the euclidean norm for normalization of intensity profiles. clustering after confirmation of the import options, the clustering dialog is opened. here, a title and the number of prototypes have to be specified. marvis starts the iterative clustering process and displays the intermediate prototype intensity profiles for each clustering state and the number of currently associated marker candidates in a separate window. the clustering process for the example data set only takes a few seconds on a standard pc. after the clustering process has been finished, the clustering state can be selected according to the desired degree of prototype smoothing by adjusting a scrollbar. here, we choose the final clustering state corresponding to a minimal amount of smoothing, which is suitable for analysis in most cases. visualization and analysis after selection of an appropriate clustering state for analysis, marvis returns to the main window and displays the prototype profiles and the number of associated marker candidates in the upper right region. after mouse click on a column corresponding to a particular prototype, further information regarding this prototype is displayed in the other regions of the main window. the prototype plot shows the array of prototypes according to the current colormap and additional information on the associated marker candidates. the vertical axis of region 1a represents the number of data set conditions, while the horizontal axis corresponds to the prototype numbers. a cursor marks the current prototype under investigation. by default, the displayed prototype profiles are equally spaced and region 1b shows the associated cluster sizes as a bar diagram. clicking on the toggle view button changes between different graphical representation modes. besides the default view, the prototype profiles can be spaced according to the size of their associated clusters, which helps to identify dominating intensity profiles. in this case, region 1b contains the original or normalized intensity profiles of the marker candidates associated with each prototype. the title above region 1a indicates, which graphical representation mode is currently activated. by clicking on one of the columns corresponding to a prototype the associated cluster can be activated. for the data set of the wounding case study the prototype plot reveals • a block of marker candidates that show high intensities in the conditions representing wt plants only • an intermediate block of different profiles representing high intensities across wt and dde 2- mutant plants • a block of prototypes that show high intensities in the jasmonate deficient mutant plants only • and a block of candidates that particularly represent high concentrations in the third and eighth condition. the first block corresponds to clusters in that contain wound induced markers exclusively associated with wild type plants as described in. in addition, clusters related to the third block contained markers that seem to be dependent on the jasmonate deficiency. the corresponding bar diagram shows that a number of clusters contain just a few or no marker candidates at all. these ""sparse"" clusters result from the restriction of the prototypes on a 1d-topology and usually indicate the use of too many prototypes. the cluster plot shows the intensity profiles of marker candidates in the activated cluster. each column represents the intensity profile of a single marker candidate displayed according to the current colormap. a cursor indicates the currently activated candidate. by clicking the toggle view button, marvis switches between normalized and original intensities. by default normalized intensities are shown. the example data set shows large differences regarding the original intensity values. this results in a colormapping, where low original intensities cannot be visually distinguished. when the logarithmic intensities checkbox in the view menu is activated, the colormapping for original intensity profiles is calculated logarithmically. this improves the visibility of small intensity differences significantly. the logarithmic transformation is only used for the visualization of original intensity profiles and does not affect the clustering results. the marker information box shows a table of available information on all marker candidates in the currently activated cluster. each candidate is represented by one row. apart from marker candidate id, retention time and mass-to-charge-ratio, also the values for additional data attributes are displayed. in this example, the column kwpvalue represents p-values obtained from a kruskal-wallis test. these values have been used as a quality measure for selection of marker candidates in. by pressing the up and down cursor keys or selecting a particular row via mouse click, the specific candidate can be highlighted. within the marker information box, the candidates are sorted by retention time. marvis keeps this order of the input file when displaying the candidates of single clusters. the marker scatter plot displays the rt vs. m/z values of each marker candidate in the currently activated cluster using big red dots. the currently activated candidate is represented by a big blue dot. in the background all marker candidates of the data set are plotted as small gray dots. by clicking into the plot a particular candidate can be activated. using the scatter plot, putative isotopomers or adducts of compounds can easily be identified by vertical stacks of candidates that do not differ in retention time. the active-prototype/marker plot by default displays the magnified prototype of the activated cluster according to the current colormap. additional functionality marvis stores a list of selected marker candidates in memory. single candidates or entire clusters can easily be added to or removed from this list. the selected marker candidates can be exported as a csv file for further analysis, e.g. for identification of related metabolic pathways based on mass values of candidates. the candidates may also be re-clustered using a lower number of prototypes in order to avoid sparse clusters. in addition to the export of selected marker candidates, marvis can save the entire clustering result as a csv file. this includes the marker data with additional values for normalized marker candidates, cluster number, and intensity profiles of the associated prototypes. the current settings, which include the data set and all user-specific parameters, can be saved and restored. for details on the above-mentioned functions see the marvis documentation.  marvis provides a graphical user interface for exploratory data analysis, well-suited for the visualization of metabolomic intensity profiles. the realization of 1d-soms gives a convenient overview of multivariate data sets. in particular, the specialized visualization effectively supports researchers to cope with the problem of an unknown number of biologically meaningful groups of intensity profiles. in that way, interesting groups can easily be identified based on their intensity patterns and their position in the prototype array. additional data attributes that support the analysis and interpretation of marker candidates can be integrated in marvis using customized data fields in the csv input file. by using the csv export functions, the clustering results can be imported and processed by other statistical analysis software. the customizable csv file format also allows to import, cluster and analyze experimental data from other than metabolomic studies, e.g. from gene expression experiments. an example application on gene expression data is shown in the marvis documentation. availability and requirements • project

"," a central goal of experimental studies in systems biology is to identify meaningful markers that are hidden within a diffuse background of data originating from large-scale analytical intensity measurements as obtained from metabolomic experiments. intensity-based clustering is an unsupervised approach to the identification of metabolic markers based on the grouping of similar intensity profiles. a major problem of this basic approach is that in general there is no prior information about an adequate number of biologically relevant clusters.  we present the tool marvis for data mining on intensity-based profiles using one-dimensional self-organizing maps. marvis can import and export customizable csv files and provides aggregation and normalization routines for preprocessing of intensity profiles that contain repeated measurements for a number of different experimental conditions. robust clustering is then achieved by training of an 1d-som model, which introduces a similarity-based ordering of the intensity profiles. the ordering allows a convenient visualization of the intensity variations within the data and facilitates an interactive aggregation of clusters into larger blocks. the intensity-based visualization is combined with the presentation of additional data attributes, which can further support the analysis of experimental data.  marvis is a user-friendly and interactive tool for exploration of complex pattern variation in a large set of experimental intensity profiles. the application of 1d-soms gives a convenient overview on relevant profiles and groups of profiles. the specialized visualization effectively supports researchers in analyzing a large number of putative clusters, even though the true number of biologically meaningful groups is unknown. although marvis has been developed for the analysis of metabolomic data, the tool may be applied to gene expression data as well.

81," it is essential to elucidate the relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity to understand the genetic causes of phenotypic variation among natural populations. visible and chemical variations associated with genomic diversity provide the information required to identify key genes associated with such phenotypic changes. patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms and a population structure figured in a natural population have allowed us to understand the evolutionary significance of genetic variation under the influence of geographic factors or different environments. the technical development of metabolite profiling has provided quantitative phenotypic information on the metabolome among strains and identified genes involved in metabolic networks. therefore, a comprehensive exploration of the correlations between metabolic and genomic diversity, achieved by superimposing data from these two ""omics"" approaches, could provide information regarding both the broad and specific relationships between metabolo-phenotypes and genotypes. this information would aid the identification of genetic associations between the metabolic and/or visible phenotypes. metabolite quantitative trait loci analysis using segregated populations has been applied to various plant species as a popular forward genetics approach. although mqtls analysis has been used to dissect the genetic loci involved in metabolo-phenotypic changes in mapping populations of various organisms, no methods have been developed to identify the correlations between genetic polymorphisms and metabolo-phenotypic differences in divergent accessions or individuals from natural populations. to date, several attempts have been performed to find correlative relationships between genetic and metabolic diversity in various organisms. it is still unclear whether it is possible to discover such correlations between each metabolite and the polymorphic pattern found at each chromosomal location to explain natural variation. combinatorial approaches of population genomics coupled with metabolo-phenotyping should play a significant role in the exploration of the association of genetic variation with metabolic changes that have a significant impact on evolution and adaptation. in this study, to assess the correlative relationship between metabolic and genomic diversity found in rice accessions selected from the world rice collection, we compared the distance relationships of accessions for these two omics patterns, globally, with marker polymorphisms vs. the metabolomic fingerprints of nmr spectra, as well as locally, for each chromosomal region vs. each spectra. to perform these analyses, we developed a robust procedure to explore the relationship between metabolic and genomic diversity. as a result, we present the first correlation map of metabolic and genomic diversity among rice accessions.  to select the appropriate rice accessions for the comparison of metabolic profiles with patterns of genetic polymorphisms, we initially investigated the population structure of the world rice collection. the accessions of the world rice collection have been classified into three major groups, japonica, indica i, and indica ii. to determine in greater detail the genetic structure of these populations, we performed population structure analysis using structure software on data generated by genotyping restriction-fragment-length polymorphism markers. this analysis showed that the japonica type accessions were composed of sub-groups; temperate, and tropical i, ii, and iii. for the twoindica groups, the members of indica i were not divided, while those of indica ii were divided into two sub-groups; indica iia and indica iib. we chose rice accessions from representative sub-groups to cover a diverse range of cultivated rice populations, on the basis of population structure, to avoid regional bias. the rflp genotyping data were also used to generate global and local genetic distance matrices along each chromosome in combination with physical allocation data on the rice genome. soluble extracts of seeds from each accession were analyzed by 1d 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis to elucidate the metabolic diversity among the accessions. to assess the global correlation between metabolic and genomic diversity, we calculated spearman's coefficient of correlation between the distance matrices calculated from the - to -ppm 1h chemical shifts and genetic distance among accessions with polymorphisms at the rflp markers. we found no correlation between global metabolic diversity and the phylogenetic relationships among the rice accessions. although the phylogenetic tree of the genetic distance matrix showed the expected typical clusters, the metabolic diversity tree showed no identifiable clusters corresponding to the phylogenetic clusters. this result indicates that there are no relationships between the genomic and metabolic diversity of solution metabolites of rice grain in the comparison of holistic data. in higher plants, the diversity of the metabolome might tend to be unrelated with genomic diversity. in sesame, which has been an example for the comparison of metabolic and genomic diversity in higher plants, the relationship patterns generated for the aflps and the seed metabolic profiles also differed. seed metabolic profiles are derived from the transcriptome that is specifically activated in the embryo and endosperm during seed development. genes involved in the abundance of solution metabolites of rice seed might consist of small members expressed in seed specific transcriptome. although there have been few examples of the global assessment of correlations between metabolic and genomic diversity in higher plants, the recent updating of the infrastructure for population genomics and metabolomics should allow us to determine correlation patterns at different levels i.e., from genomic segments to small chromosomal regions in each organism along with their evolutionary patterns. in arabidopsis, a large number of metabolic qtls were identified in a recombinant inbred line of two parental ecotypes, which had been selected from ecotypes based on their metabolic profiles. most of the metabolic variation observed among the ecotypes was successfully mapped using this ril population, indicating that metabolic variation can be associated with simplified polymorphic patterns at specific chromosomal regions. we then calculated the rs of euclidian distance matrices derived from each -ppm integral region of the 1h chemical shift against the genetic distance matrices derived from sets of three adjacent markers along each chromosome. the results of these local analyses are presented as a 2d correlation map. to assess the statistical significance of each correlation coefficient value in this dataset, we calculated the p-value for each rs value and determined the relationship between the rs value and the p-value for all combinations. as a result of this analysis, an rs value of was supported with a p-value of e-07; the value of rs at the % level of the p-value was between ≥ and ≤. we also calculated the correlation coefficient values between each genetic distance matrix of three randomly sampled rflp markers and the metabolic profile of each of the nmr spectra in trials to estimate the probability of a high correlation by random chance. the results showed that the probability of a correlation coefficient rs ≥ in the randomized data was less than 1%. therefore, in this analysis, we applied rs = as the threshold to detect correlative combinations between metabolic and genomic diversity. the presentation of the correlations as a 2d heat map showed large non-correlative areas studded with correlative areas, which can be explored in omics-wide comparisons. the heat map showed clear correlations between the profiles of soluble metabolites and local genomic diversity at each chromosomal location. to identify metabolites, we performed 2d 1h-13c nmr analysis. diversity in the choline profile showed a high correlation with genetic diversity around the r rflp marker, located at cm on chromosome. the lipid methylene signal showed correlations with polymorphic sites at multiple chromosomal locations, with the highest located around the c rflp marker at cm on chr., and the second highest around r at cm on chr.. the correlation peaks corresponding to each of the lipids with chr., chr., and chr. were in good accordance with the covalent bond networks within molecules of each compound. furthermore, sucrose with chr. and chr. also showed good accordance. similar intramolecular covalent bond networks were reported in nmr experiments of biological metabolite mixtures, including covariance total correlation spectroscopy analysis of insect venom and tocsy analysis of intact human gut biopsies. local comparison between the dendrogram based on the correlative rflp polymorphisms and nmr spectra showed a similar tree structure between both genetic and metabolic variation among the accessions. for example, the dendrogram of genetic polymorphisms around the c rflp marker and the diversity of the lipid methylene signal indicated the genetic and metabolic divergence between indica i and two other groups, japonica and indica ii. to display the chromosomal locations of the correlative regions at rflp markers, the results of the correlation analysis were superimposed onto a genetic map of rice. this genetic map should allow us to identify metabolic qtls associated with each of the metabolic abundances allocated on a genetic map. it would be beneficial if future genetic analyses narrowed down candidate genes and/or isolated such metabolic qtls in combination with other genomic resources for rice such as genetic marker systems and genome annotation databases. throughout this study, we developed a robust approach to explore the correlation between genomic and metabolomic diversity observed in natural variation, which is shown as a schematic flow in additional file the procedure is summarized as follows: selection of appropriate accessions based on population structures; acquisition of the metabolic profile of selected accessions using various types of metabolomics platforms and the calculation of the distance among accessions on the basis of metabolite abundance or spectrum intensities; genotyping of selected accessions using dna markers covering the whole genome and the calculation of local genetic distance among accessions from genotype data of adjacent marker sets; to discover the correlative relationships between each metabolite and chromosomal region and the coefficients of correlation for metabolic and genetic distances in all-against-all combinations and to display their distribution on a genetic map. in this analysis of rice, we did not find a correlation between metabolic and genomic diversity as observed in previously reported studies. on the other hand, local correlation analysis allowed us to identify small correlative areas mostly in non-correlative spaces. this suggests that local correlation analysis could be an effective method to discover such correlative areas allocated to chromosomal regions together with linkage maps or variation data of genomic sequences. this study illustrated a new integrative approach to explore the links between metabolomics and genomics. the procedure could be extended to a higher resolution by using denser polymorphic marker maps in various species.  this study assessed the correlative relationships between genetic and metabolic diversity among rice accessions. the data presents the first correlative relationship for the chromosomal distribution of each metabolic profile in rice. the combinatorial use of genomic and metabolomic data demonstrated here should facilitate the elucidation of complex regulatory networks and those of evolutionary significance in plant metabolic systems. "," it is essential to elucidate the relationship between metabolic and genomic diversity to understand the genetic regulatory networks associated with the changing metabolo-phenotype among natural variation and/or populations. recent innovations in metabolomics technologies allow us to grasp the comprehensive features of the metabolome. metabolite quantitative trait analysis is a key approach for the identification of genetic loci involved in metabolite variation using segregated populations. although several attempts have been made to find correlative relationships between genetic and metabolic diversity among natural populations in various organisms, it is still unclear whether it is possible to discover such correlations between each metabolite and the polymorphisms found at each chromosomal location. to assess the correlative relationship between the metabolic and genomic diversity found in rice accessions, we compared the distance matrices for these two ""omics"" patterns in the rice accessions.  we selected accessions from the world rice collection based on their population structure. to determine the genomic diversity of the rice genome, we genotyped restriction fragment length polymorphism markers to calculate the genetic distance among the accessions. to identify the variations in the metabolic fingerprint, a soluble extract from the seed grain of each accession was analyzed with one dimensional 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance. we found no correlation between global metabolic diversity and the phylogenetic relationships among the rice accessions by analyzing the distance matrices and the genetic distance on the basis of the rflp markers. however, local correlation analysis between the distance matrices against genetic distance matrices, generated clear correlations at rflp markers.  this combinatorial approach will be valuable for exploring the correlative relationships between metabolic and genomic diversity. it will facilitate the elucidation of complex regulatory networks and those of evolutionary significance in plant metabolic systems.

82," anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction is a major process determining deep-sea geochemistry and cold-seep ecosystems. first of all, it controls the atmospheric methane efflux from the ocean floor, consuming more than 90% of the methane produced in marine sediments. moreover, it fuels the deep sea ecosystem by channelling thermal generated and biogenetic methane into organic matter and carbonate. finally, sr-aom shapes the sea floor landscape by contributing to bicarbonate and alkalinity production, resulting in massive carbonate precipitation. the overall sr-aom reaction is: two groups of microorganisms are the key players in sr-aom process: anaerobic methanotrophic archaea with three groups and sulphate reducing bacteria. all anme groups discovered so far are related clades of methanogens, while their srb partner was always found in the same environment with or without forming spatial closely related consortia. however, neither anme nor srb from sr-aom active spots has been obtained in pure culture yet. the main difficulty lies on the extremely long doubling time and low growth yield of anme and srb from in vitro incubations. to stimulate the in vitro sr-aom activity and to enrich the sr-aom community, different types of bioreactors, which can be operated at ambient/high pressure in continuous/batch mode, have been developed by different research groups. due to the extremely low affinity for methane and the low methane solubility at ambient pressure, high-pressure bioreactors have the advantage of permitting a higher sr-aom activity. nevertheless, it is still unknown if the high-pressure bioreactor also confers advantage on biomass enrichment, and if it has an effect on selective enrichment of certain groups of anme. moreover, the information is lacking on the community architecture inside the high-pressure bioreactor, meaning if the microbes live as single cells or form consortia. through high-pressure incubation, we have obtained an enrichment originating from a mud volcano from the gulf of cadiz, performing anaerobic oxidation of methane. the sr-aom activities at different incubation conditions have been described previously. in this study, the community structure and architecture of this enrichment were investigated. the potential growth of anme and srb under high pressure has been evaluated.  community architectural distribution to access the community architectural distribution, a dapi staining was applied on the samples s and s. based on dapi staining cell counts, both single cells and aggregates were commonly observed in s and s the aggregates had different sizes ranging from to μm in diameter. in both s and s single cells were 1- orders more abundant than the aggregates. among all the aggregates, the ones with diameter from to μm were the most abundant ones. few spherical aggregates bigger than μm were observed in s or s. for some aggregates we observed that it was dividing into two smaller spherical aggregates in both s and s. this was also reported in another enrichment from a semi-continuous bioreactor operated under mpa methane pressure. it is an indication that these large aggregates may have reached a ""critical size"" during growth, which then may disintegrate into smaller aggregates for further growth. cell aggregates accounted for the major part of the biovolume. the middle size aggregates contributed for about half of the total biovolume. although the big size aggregates had very low concentrations, they also contributed for large part of the biovolume. enrichment of total biomass the total biovolume concentration increased from * μm3/ml slurry in s to * μm3/ml slurry in s. since the reactor volume was fixed and the biomass washing out during reactor operation was negligible, the total biomass inside the reactor increased times within days. this reactor system was the first system that was able to accumulate total biomass while maintaining high sr-aom activity-- mmol sulfide production per day while the reactor was operated at batch mode under mpa methane pressure. in the systems previously reported by other authors, either only specific groups but not the total biomass was quantified or there was major loss of biomass due to sampling and decay. the biovolume data was converted into cell dry weight for a comparison with vss data. taken the same assumption as described by nauhaus et al., there was about g cell dry weight/ml biovolume in the sediment sample with sr-aom activity. therefore the biomass concentration in the high-pressure bioreactor increased from in s to in s however, this value was one order lower compared to the g/l of vss as reported by zhang et al.. one possibility is that the assumption g cell dry weight/ml biovolume was based on analysis of two strains of small marine microorganism, which could be not representative of the cells enriched in the reactor. another possibility would be the extracellular polymeric substances contributed large part of vss. for example, for granular microbial aggregates enriched in an oland reactor, as much as 50-80% of the space occupied by bacteria was constituted of eps. for the deep-sea sediment, the presence of eps has been reported both from in situ sediment and in vitro enrichments at different locations. however whether the production of eps was stimulated during high-pressure incubations and what was the mechanism behind still needs to be further investigated. community structure to identify the cells and aggregates observed under microscope, catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes on anme- and srb was applied on s and s based on card-fish counts, anme- and srb were the most abundant ones compared to other types of anme, especially in the form of aggregates. among the free-living cells, only less than 10% belonged to anme- or srb. the number of anme- aggregates accounted for ± % of the total aggregates in s and ± % in s while srb accounted for ± % of the total aggregates in s and ± % in s however, it has to be taken into account that the card-fish in this study was performed with single probe hybridization. aggregates with anme- are most probably also containing srb as well, because they tend to live closely and form consortia. no anme- was detected in s and s about 2% of anme- was detected in the aggregates. the average value and standard error were calculated based on fields of view on each hybridization. no anme- cell or aggregate was observed based on our method. detection limit of × cells/ml slurry. detection limit of × cells/ml slurry the card-fish result showed that a large part of biomass in s and s especially single cells, did not belong to anme or srb. there was growth of other unknown microbes within a mixed community of anme/srb. therefore a clone library analysis was performed on s to approach to the complete archaeal and bacterial communities. archaeal community had extremely low diversity, where anme-2a and mbg-d were the only two groups of archaea detected. anme-2a was the dominant, which accounted for 88% of the archaeal community. no 16s rrna gene from anme- was detected. the absence of anme- in the archaeal clone library was contradictory to card-fish result. the size of the clone library was not large enough to detect the rare anme- or the hybridization experiment may have led to mis-hybridization, thus giving false positive signal. dissimilar from archaeal community, the bacterial community was highly diverse. gammaproteobacteria were the most dominant followed by the deltaproteobacteria, which includes the srb. among total bacteria population in s 8% was belonging to seep-srb1a subgroup of deltaproteobacteria, which were found to be specifically associated with anme-2a in other enrichments mediating sr-aom process. most of the gammaproteobacteria found in the community were closely related to methylophaga sp. and methylobacter sp., which are known to use reduced one-carbon compounds, such as methane, methanol or dimethylsulphide. the presence of such bacteria in our anaerobic reactor is intriguing since methane and sulphate were the only electron donor and acceptor supplied. the presence and even production of sulphide was an indication of anaerobic condition inside the reactor. however we cannot exclude the possibility of a limited amount of dissolved oxygen in the reactor influent, which could explain the presence of aerobic. further tests need to show if these gammaproteobacteria are playing an important active role in the reactor. enrichment of anme- and srb card-fish results showed that percentages of anme- and srb biovolume increased from ± % and ± % in s to ± % and ± % in s. by combining with the total biovolume data from dapi staining, the biovolume of anme- in s was: * % = * μm3/ml slurry the biovolume of anme- in s was: * % = * μm3/ml slurry therefore after days incubation, the anme- population increased for times. following the same method of calculation, the srb population increased for times after days incubation in this high-pressure bioreactor. the populations of anme- and srb both increased faster than the total biomass, which indicated that anme- and srb were selectively enriched in the system. this selective enrichment of anme- and srb was another proof that the incubation condition inside this high-pressure bioreactor was favourable for sr-aom community. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the enrichment of sr-aom community under high methane pressure, although potential growth of anme- anme- and srb has been reported in other engineered systems at ambient or low methane pressures. the different inocula showed different doubling times. when anme- and anme-2c were incubated in continuous flow bioreactors under ambient methane partial pressure, anme- had doubling time of months while anme-2c had doubling time of months. high methane partial pressure appeared to have advantage on stimulating the growth of anme. in the experiment of krüger et al., the methane-dependent uptake of 15n-nh by aom community dominated by anme- was higher at mpa methane pressure than at ambient methane pressure. if we assume the anme-2a cells in our system were following a logarithmic growth curve, a doubling time of months can be estimated based on anme- biovolume in s and s which is shorter than the result obtained by meulepas et al.. the increase of energy gained from sr-aom process by increasing methane pressure may favour the biomass growth. continuous flow also stimulated growth: anme-2a/2c had longer doubling time in a fed-batch bioreactor than in continuous flow bioreactors.  after days incubation in a simulated cold seep environment under high methane pressure, anme- and srb in the sediment from captain arutyunov mud volcano were enriched. based on biovolume calculation, the populations of anme- and srb increased for times and times. within total biomass volume, % was accounted from aggregates. therefore the incubation condition apparently favoured the cells to form aggregates, especially in small size, rather than to live as single cells. no aggregate bigger than μm in diameter was observed; they apparently divided after reaching a critical size. based on the 16s rrna gene clone library, the archaeal diversity was low, and contained only anme- and mbg-d. in contrast, the bacterial community was highly diverse. "," anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction prevents more than 90% of the oceanic methane emission to the atmosphere. in a previous study, we demonstrated that the high methane pressure stimulated in vitro sr-aom activity. however, the information on the effect of high-pressure on the microbial community structure and architecture was still lacking.  in this study we analysed the long-term enrichment of this microbial community, which was mediating sr-aom in a continuous high-pressure bioreactor. % of the total biovolume represented cells in the form of small aggregates. an increase of the total biovolume was observed. after days, the anme- and srb increased with a factor and, respectively.  this paper reports a net biomass growth of communities involved in sr-aom, incubated at high-pressure.

83," peutz-jeghers syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder typified by hamartomatous polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract and melanin pigmentation of the oro-facial region. although germline mutations in the coding sequence of the serine-threonine kinase gene stk11/lkb have been found to cause pjs, such mutations only account for up to 80% of cases. in addition to locus heterogeneity mutations in regulatory sequences of stk11/lkb may cause pjs. identifying regulatory genomic sequences through functional assays is time consuming and problematic. as natural selection is more likely to tolerate sequence changes in redundant, non-functional sequence than in functionally important sequences, regulatory elements in non-coding sequence will be highly conserved through evolution. comparison of sequence between both closely related and highly divergent species therefore allows for the identification of non-coding sequence that has a high probability of being important to the regulation of gene transcription. this alternative approach to the identification of promoter elements is termed ""phylogenetic foot printing"". here we describe the phylogenetic foot printing of the 5' upstream region of stk11/lkb and the sequence analysis of this region in a series of pjs cases in whom exonic and splice site mutations in the gene had been excluded.  additional analysis using the tfbs prediction programs transplorer and proscan v identified binding sites between nucleotides - and - and binding sites between nucleotides - and - respectively, confirming the presence of regulatory elements within the consensus region. ecr browser/ rvista and consite have previously been shown to correctly identify 88% and 66% of tfbs in functionally verified promoter elements respectively and it is highly likely, therefore, that the consensus region encompassing nucleotides - to - contains stk11/lkb promoter elements. dna from a series of pjs patients that did not harbour germline stk11/lkb mutations was studied for mutations in the region between nucleotides - to - encompassing all tfbss predicted by rvista and consite. seven of the cases had a documented family history of pjs. the diagnosis of pjs in all cases was based on established criteria. three sequence changes were identified. the change g → c at position - was found in four cases and represented a previously documented single nucleotide polymorphism. an additional single nucleotide change at position - was identified in eight cases. a single sample of control dna used as a sequence reference was also found to be homozygous for the change. finally, a two base pair deletion coupled with a single base pair insertion at position - was identified in one case. a series of healthy population controls was screened by high performance liquid chromatography and one individual was found to harbour the sequence change. none of these three sequence changes identified were therefore deemed to be potentially pathogenic. there is a high degree of redundancy in promoter elements of genes, however point mutations in promoter regions of pten and mlh have been reported to be disease causing. to investigate the possibility of large-scale deletions or insertions undetectable by straightforward pcr primers p1fwd and p3rev were used to amplify an bp fragment with products visualised on a 2% agarose gel. no large-scale deletions or insertions were detected in any of the patients.  as understanding of the contribution of coding sequence changes to disease becomes clearer, attention will focus on regulatory elements of genes. phylogenetic foot printing using programs such as ecr browser and consite present potentially powerful tools in identifying regulatory elements, enabling the analysis of these sequences without time consuming functional studies. although the efficiency of in-silico delineation of promoter elements has not been rigorously evaluated, ecr browser/ rvista and consite have been shown to correctly identify 88% and 66% of tfbs respectively. on the basis of our findings, however, it appears unlikely that mutations in the promoter region of stk11/lkb are responsible for pjs cases not attributable to exonic sequence changes. "," germline mutations or large-scale deletions in the coding region and splice sites of stk11/lkb do not account for all cases of peutz-jeghers syndrome. it is conceivable that, on the basis of data from other diseases, inherited variation in promoter elements of stk11/lkb may cause pjs.  phylogenetic foot printing and transcription factor binding site prediction of sequence 5' to the coding sequence of stk11/lkb was performed to identify non-coding sequences of dna indicative of regulatory elements. a series of pjs cases in whom no mutation in stk11/lkb could be identified were screened for sequence changes in the putative promoter defined by nucleotides - to - two novel sequence changes were identified, but were found to be present in healthy individuals.  these findings indicate that promoter sequence changes are unlikely to contribute to pjs.

84," the sequencing and in-silico analysis of messenger rna is now routinely being applied to complex microbial communities in diverse eco-systems, including, but not limited to: soil, marine and intestinal habitats. the typical goals of metatranscriptomics are to taxonomically classify transcripts, predict their functions and quantify their abundances, and to relate these to environmental data in order to reveal how environmental conditions impact microbial communities in different habitats. metatranscriptome data sets typically consist of hundreds of thousands of sequences, or, more recently tens of millions of illumina sequences per sample. low taxonomic diversity and/or highly expressed genes can lead to a high degree of data redundancy; that is multiple identical or nearly identical sequence fragments. in an investigation into the proportion of artificial and natural duplicates in pyrosequenced metatranscriptome data, niu et al. reported that as much as 60% of all sequences in an early metatranscriptome data set were likely natural duplicates. therefore, some form of data reduction strategy is beneficial before running computationally intensive homology searches. two approaches that are commonly employed to reduce redundancy in large data sets are assembly: where sequences are assembled into longer contiguous fragments and clustering: sequences are grouped into clusters sharing a defined degree of similarity. the decisions as to whether to perform data reduction and which method to employ are influenced by several factors: the availability of reference genomes: if sufficient reference genomes are available for a small number of dominant species then the sequences can be mapped to them and taxonomy and function inferred and the relative abundance of the transcripts calculated. read length - are the unprocessed reads long enough to return annotations? current illumina platforms produce shorter reads than and are likely to return a lower hit rate to protein databases compared to longer reads. the diversity of the sample: although assembly can produce longer sequences and increase the accuracy of subsequent annotations, the variable coverage of transcripts in metatranscriptomics data sets and the presence of closely related organisms can lead to chimeric contigs. indeed, for highly diverse metagenomic samples it has been recommended that assembly not be performed at all. the aims of the analysis: if the read length is adequate for annotation and the intention is to count features then clustering at high identities is a recommended alternative. with the lower coverage but higher read length of metatranscriptome data, assembly is relatively uncommon and instead authors tend to either cluster or annotate sequences individually. clustering is regularly used for detecting and removing sequencing artifacts from data, grouping rrna data into operational taxonomic units, and grouping proteins into families. in addition to the known benefits of a reduction in the size of the data set and therefore computation time, we set out to assess whether, by clustering translated metatranscriptome sequences and transferring protein domain annotation from cluster representatives to cluster members - some of which may only partially cover protein domains used for classification, we can accurately increase the number of classifiable reads. more specifically, we investigated some popular data reduction tools and assessed their performance on simulated and illumina metatranscriptome data in terms of the accuracy of resulting protein annotations. note that although several approaches have been described to simulate metagenomic data sets and rna-seq data, to date only small scale attempts have been made to simulate metatranscriptome data sets based on a small number of species.  simulated data the simulated data sets contained sequences each, totalling ~ megabases of sequence per diversity level. between and 14% of sequences from each data set returned matches to pfam-a. when compared to the theoretical domain content, the correlation coefficients for all read annotation were, and for ld, md and hd respectively.table correlation coefficients between simulated data set annotations and known protein domain content all clustered contigs debris assembly 1 clustered assembly summary of pearson correlation coefficients between processed data sets and the known domain content of sample for low diversity, medium diversity and high diversity simulated and illumina metatranscriptomes. 1assembly includes annotation from both contigs and debris sequences. then, taking the parameter set that provided the largest increase in true positives minus false positives, compared to the annotation of all unclustered reads, we found that the best clustering parameters were: ≥ 60% overall similarity and 100% coverage of cluster member sequences for the ld data set; ≥80% similarity and 100% coverage of the cluster members for the md data set; and ≥60% similarity, ≥25% coverage of the cluster representative and between 0-50% minimum coverage of cluster members for the hd data set. while the best performing clustering parameters produced a net gain of between and domains, the correlation coefficients were slightly lower than for all read annotation ). the mira assemblies incorporated ~50% of all sequences into and contigs for the ld and md samples respectively, and ~30% of sequences into contigs for the hd sample. the average contig lengths were, and base pairs for ld, md and hd, respectively. the average contig entropy was, and for ld, md and hd respectively with %, % and % of contigs possessing an entropy of zero.figure contig entropy for assembled simulated metatranscriptomes. contig entropy plotted against contig length for a) mira assembled simulated data sets and b) trinity assembled simulated illumina data sets. plots represent, from left to right: low diversity, medium diversity and high diversity data sets. for the ld and md data sets, the net gain of true positives was a ~100% increase, and for the hd data set an increase of ~20% was achieved. the contigs alone had a weaker correlation with the theoretical domain content than all read or clustered read annotation. when combined with the debris sequences, the correlation coefficients for all three samples were higher than for all all-read or clustered annotations ). this could be due to two factors: firstly the low proportion of sequences incorporated into the contigs, and secondly the assemblies may be biased towards high-abundance transcripts.figure results from pfam-a annotated simulated metatranscriptomes. percentage of true positives, false positives, true negatives and potential domains based on a comparison with the known domain content of the data sets for all reads, best clustering, assembly and clustered assembly. a) results for simulated data sets, from left to right: low, medium and high diversity. b) results for simulated illumina data sets from left to right: low, medium and high diversity. correlation between high diversity simulations and known protein domain content. correlation plots of pfam-a annotations of each processed data set compared to known domain content for a) high diversity simulated data set and b) high diversity illumina simulated data set. top row, left to right: all reads unprocessed;

with the high diversity simulations producing the weakest correlations with the known domain content of the sample. with a highly diverse population of organisms and transcripts, the average coverage of each transcript will decrease, thus clustering will result in many small clusters and fewer transcripts will be sequenced to sufficient depth to allow extension into longer contiguous fragments. however, regardless of the diversity level a better reflection of the domain content of the samples was achieved through applying data reduction techniques. the largest improvements in the correlation with the known domain content of the samples was achieved through assembly for the simulations and assembly followed by clustering the contigs and debris together for the illumina simulations. using near default parameters, highly homogeneous contigs were recreated from both and illumina data. it has been noted previously that assembly of'omics data is likely to favour highly abundant organisms, and it therefore follows that it would also favour highly abundant transcripts. the results of our simulations suggest that the annotations of contigs alone are insufficient, and we therefore recommend that they should be combined with those of the debris sequences to provide a better reflection of the real domain content of the samples. overall, the simulated illumina samples produced stronger correlations with the known protein domain content than the dollar cost-equivalent amount of sequence data. while we attempted to perform this analysis as consistently as possible, it was necessary to employ different assembly programs for the and illumina data –. however, the overall pattern of correlations from the different methods is fairly consistent and it seems likely that the stronger correlations of the illumina simulations are due to the greatly increased coverage provided rather than any biases introduced by the methods. while these simulations have their limitations, the results achieved were consistent with trials on real metatranscriptome data. we applied the data reduction methods previously employed on simulated data to two real metatranscriptome data sets: the mid-bloom, marine metatranscriptome from; and the 110 m marine metatranscriptome from an oxygen minimum zone. although the genuine domain content of a real microbial metatranscriptome is unknown, the results obtained from the gilbert and stewart metatranscriptomes were, in terms of data reduction and annotation rates, consistent with the medium and high diversity simulations. also, a recent study demonstrated that assembly of a simulated low diversity eukaryotic metatranscriptome could recreate a high number of contigs with low chimerism. in the future, these methods could be extended to exploit the increasing availability of microbial genomes and transcriptomes. for example, in real metatranscriptome data, the most abundant transcripts are often associated with fundamental processes such as biosynthesis. as more microbial transcriptome data become available ), it should be possible to refine these models of transcript abundance to reflect increased levels of transcripts involved in core processes and thereby produce more realistic simulations of metatranscriptome data.  based on our simulations, it appears that older recommendations to omit the assembly stage when dealing with high-diversity samples do not extend to metatranscriptome data. our results also show that including unassembled reads in downstream annotation can improve the overall accuracy and we would recommend that they should not be discarded after assembly. therefore, whether dealing with or illumina data, we recommend combining annotations from contigs and unassembled sequences for samples and employing a two-step data reduction of assembly followed by clustering of contigs and debris for illumina. the high coverage afforded by illumina sequencing has made it an increasingly popular choice for sequencing microbial communities. as more purpose built de-novo transcript assemblers become available there is a need for a systematic assessment of assembly tools and sequencing protocols for illumina metatranscriptome data. "," metatranscriptome sequence data can contain highly redundant sequences from diverse populations of microbes and so data reduction techniques are often applied before taxonomic and functional annotation. for metagenomic data, it has been observed that the variable coverage and presence of closely related organisms can lead to fragmented assemblies containing chimeric contigs that may reduce the accuracy of downstream analyses and some advocate the use of alternate data reduction techniques. however, it is unclear how such data reduction techniques impact the annotation of metatranscriptome data and thus affect the interpretation of the results.  to investigate the effect of such techniques on the annotation of metatranscriptome data we assess two commonly employed methods: clustering and de-novo assembly. to do this, we also developed an approach to simulate and illumina metatranscriptome data sets with varying degrees of taxonomic diversity. for the illumina simulations, we found that a two-step approach of assembly followed by clustering of contigs and unassembled sequences produced the most accurate reflection of the real protein domain content of the sample. for the simulations, the combined annotation of contigs and unassembled reads produced the most accurate protein domain annotations.  based on these data we recommend that assembly be attempted, and that unassembled reads be included in the final annotation for metatranscriptome data, even from highly diverse environments as the resulting annotations should lead to a more accurate reflection of the transcriptional behaviour of the microbial population under investigation. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords metatranscriptomicssequence processingdata reductionclusteringassemblyissue-copyright-statement© the author 2014 ",758fd7b8-3b3b-4916-af08-d9a68ff66d3f,pubmed
85," microorganisms constitute more than half of the total biomass of earth; however, we have just made the first steps in discovering and measuring the diversity, abundance and function of these microbial ecosystems. macroorganisms live, therefore, with a pool of microorganisms, being in close contact and continuously interacting with them. some of the microorganisms are beneficial and mutualistic relationships have evolved with the host, while others can have detrimental effects on the host. to defend themselves against these potential parasites and maintain their health status, host organisms have evolved a complex system of behavioral, mechanical and chemical defenses, the immune system being of the utmost importance. in birds, some bacteria inhabiting the feathers are detrimental to the bird by degrading keratin, thus altering thermoregulation, flight and ultimately fitness. to maintain feather condition, birds have evolved several anti-bacterial defenses, including the deposition of preen secretions onto feathers. preening may have antibacterial effects either by the direct activity of antibacterial compounds, by antibacterial substances secreted by the uropygial gland-associated symbiotic bacteria or by forming a mechanical barrier between the bacteria and the feather surface. recently it has been shown that preen secretion production and preening frequency are adjusted to feather bacterial load, suggesting that they are energetically costly inducible antibacterial defenses. preen secretions are composed mainly of oily substances which probably require considerable energy in their anabolism. in addition, preening is an energetically costly behavior that takes a substantial portion of a bird’s time budget. preening and preen secretion therefore probably compete with other costly life-history traits. in particular, investment in preen gland associated traits have been suggested to trade-off with investment in immune defense. accordingly, immune-challenged or experimentally-infected tawny owls and house sparrows develop smaller preen glands, while apapanes infected with plasmodium preen less frequently. although feather bacteria load is essentially controlled by preen secretions, some feather bacteria can gain access into the tissue under specific conditions and become opportunistic pathogens, as demonstrated for some usually benign skin bacteria in humans. therefore, selection may favor maintaining an appropriate level of immune defense - the final line of defense against parasites - when facing high feather bacterial load. how birds invest in the energetically competing defenses that are preen secretions and the immune system when facing varying degree of feather bacteria load is, however, unknown. in a previous study, we have shown that preen secretion quantity and preening frequency increased with experimentally increased feather bacterial load in captive feral pigeons. therefore, to shed light on how birds balance the trade-off between immunity and preen secretions when facing high or low feather bacterial loads, we investigated the effect of feather bacteria load on immune defense in the same experimental pigeons. given the potential trade-off between preen secretion and immunity, birds experiencing high bacterial load are expected to have decreased overall immune response. however, they are expected also to maintain immune defenses against microparasites, against which the first line of defense is mediated by constitutive innate immunity, a mixture of humoral and cellular components. providing a broad characterization of the immune system of vertebrates is a non-trivial challenge in immunoecological studies, and simultaneous measurements of multiple immune parameters are necessary. here we used five measures to assess the immunity of pigeons: the response to phytohemagglutinin, a measure of induced pro-inflammatory capacity; the hemagglutination and the hemolysis capacity of plasma, a measure of the natural antibody and complement levels, respectively; the bactericidal capacity of whole blood, a measure of the capacity to eliminate bacterial pathogens; and the response against keyhole limpet hemocyanin, a measure of induced humoral immune response. finally, because variation in immunity is usually associated with increased susceptibility to pathogens, we measured the intensity of blood parasite infection.  bact- birds had lower bacterial load on feathers than control birds, while bact+ birds had higher bacterial load than co birds. body condition did not differ among treatments. pha response varied with treatment. bact+ birds had lower pha response than bact- and co birds. pha response tended to increase with wing length but it did not depend upon sex or morph.figure tukey boxplot of pha response in bact- co and bact+ birds. bact+ and bact- birds had higher bacterial killing ability than co birds for all three bacteria strains tested. however, differences in bka between treatments was significant only for the two strains of e. coli, while it was not significant for s. aureus. bact- birds had significantly higher bka against e. coli than co birds, while bact+ birds had intermediate bka against e. coli that did not differ with co or bact- birds. bka did not depend upon sex or color morph.figure tukey boxplot of whole blood bacterial killing ability against e. coli atcc e. coli atcc and s. aureus in bact-, co and bact+ birds. hemagglutination and hemolysis were not correlated with one another. agglutination and lysis were unrelated to treatment. agglutination was unrelated to sex, while lysis was higher in males than females. agglutination and lysis did not vary with color morph. primary and secondary responses to klh challenge were unrelated to treatment, sex and color morph.figure anti-klh antibody levels in plasma of bact-, co and bact+ birds, over the days after klh first and second injection. captivity tended to decrease blood parasite load. the change in blood parasite load between day and day of treatment was not different between bact-, bact+ and co birds. it did not vary with sex and color morph. discussion in this study, we investigated how pigeons invest in the immune system when facing high or low feather bacterial load. birds with increased bacterial load on plumage had lower response to pha skin swelling test compared to control birds and birds with decreased bacterial load. pha injection generates acute inflammation, a known energetically costly process, which is traded-off with various life-history traits, such as molt, breeding or growth. in a previous study, we have found that pigeons with increased feather bacterial load invested more in behavioral and chemical defenses against feather bacteria than control birds. investment in these antibacterial defenses has been suggested to be energetically costly, and birds with high bacteria load on their plumage, investing more in preen secretions and preening, may not be able to sustain the costs of pha-induced inflammation. our result is, therefore, consistent with a trade-off between immunity and preening in birds. it also suggests that birds facing high bacterial load preferentially invest in preen secretions – the first line of defense against feather bacteria – rather than in costly inflammatory processes. the pha response is the only immune process that varied with increased bacterial load. the bactericidal capacity of whole blood did not differ between birds with increased feather bacterial load and controls. this assay estimates the capacity of the blood to rapidly thwart a potential bacterial pathogen. this activity is a combination of several mechanisms of the innate immune system, including phagocytosis and the activities of humoral proteins such as natural antibodies, complement, antibacterial enzymes and peptides. thus, it is considered as the most general and integrative in vitro measurement of the constituent elements of the innate immune system. bactericidal activity of blood has been shown to be positively correlated with experimental or natural infection in several species. feather bacteria can gain entry into damaged skin and can potentially pass into the body through the gastrointestinal barrier once ingested during preening activities. birds facing high feather bacterial load may therefore be more at risk of infection by feather bacteria and may need to maintain investment in immune components against microparasites measured by the blood bactericidal activity test. further studies are needed to determine whether pigeons with experimentally increased feather bacterial load do face higher bacterial ingestion and entry. non-exclusively, pigeons facing high bacterial load may maintain blood bactericidal activity while decreasing pha-induced response, because the later is more costly and thus the first to be traded-off against preen secretion. in contrast, birds with decreased bacterial load had higher bacterial killing ability against e. coli than control birds. birds with decreased bacteria load on plumage may save energy from decreased preening frequency and/or investment in preen secretion and therefore may be able to invest more in these components of the innate immunity. we did not find evidence for effects of feather bacterial load on acquired immunity in pigeons. experimental pigeons injected with klh, a novel antigen, did not vary the primary and secondary antibody response. we also did not find evidence from the hemagglutination-hemolysis assay for effects of feather bacterial load on the levels of natural antibodies and complement. nabs are part of the innate immune system and delay pathogen replication until the developing acquired humoral and cellular immune responses clear the infection. nabs are thought to be relatively insensitive to short-term changes in environmental conditions and have been shown to be unaffected by experimental infections or food limitation. our results are in line with these studies showing that non-specific inflammation is more sensitive to changes in host condition and/or workload than are antibody responses. for example, in pied flycatchers, females with experimentally-reduced clutch size have lower response to pha, but similar antibody responses as controls.  in conclusion, our study suggests that increased feather bacterial load in pigeons negatively affected the components of the induced innate immune response involved in pha-induced inflammation, while decreased feather bacterial load positively affected the components associated with the constitutive innate immune system that are measured by the bacterial killing ability test. these results are consistent with a trade-off between investment in preen secretion and immunity. no other components of the immune system were, however, found to be affected by manipulation of feather bacterial load. whether these components were maintained to protect against feather bacteria that may enter the body or not sufficiently costly to be traded-off with preen secretion requires further study. more generally, this study reinforces the idea that feathers microbiota may have a strong impact on ecology and evolution of the avian host. "," complex communities of bacteria inhabit the feathers of all birds. under normal conditions, individuals maintain a healthy state by defending themselves against these potential invaders by preening. the immune system is only triggered when bacteria gain access into the body. preening is, however, costly and may trade-off with investment in the immune system. to shed light on how birds balance the trade-off between immunity and preen secretions when facing high or low feather bacterial load, we experimentally manipulated feather bacteria load of feral pigeons, and investigated the effects on immune defenses.  birds facing high feather bacterial load had lower immune response to pha skin-swelling test than controls, while birds facing low feather bacterial load had higher blood bacterial killing ability than controls. no other components of the immune system were found to be affected by feather bacterial load.  pigeons had previously been shown to adjust preening to feather bacterial load. the decrease in the energetically costly inflammatory response of birds experiencing high bacterial load suggests a trade-off between investment in preen secretion and immunity and reinforces the idea that feather microbiota may have a strong impact on the ecology and evolution of the avian host. keywords microbiotaphabacterial killing abilityimmune systempigeonscolumba liviaissue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",d6c188bf-833a-4ff6-bebd-65756f1ddbae,pubmed
86," chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to cause damage to the adult and developing nervous system. for example, in vivo chronic ethanol has been shown to cause aberrant sprouting of hippocampal neurites in developing rats, increase the length of dendrites in cerebellar purkinje neurons, the size of synaptic terminals of cerebellar granule cells, and the number of dendritic spines on hippocampal dentate granule neurons in adult rats. furthermore, in vitro ethanol enhances neurite outgrowth in cultured rat cerebellar neurons. contrary to the enhancement of neurite outgrowth, other studies have shown that chronic ethanol exposure inhibits the growth of dendrites in ca hippocampal neurons and cerebellar purkinje cells in vivo and inhibits chick spinal cord neurite formation in vitro. however, the mechanisms underlying this alteration of dendrite formation induced by ethanol exposure remain unknown. pc cells have been used as a cell culture model system to study the underlying mechanisms of ethanol's alteration of neurite outgrowth. pc cells are a rat chromaffin cell line that differentiate into neuronal-like cells in the presence of nerve growth factor. using these cells, chronic ethanol has been shown to enhance ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. thus, pc cells have proven to be a valuable system for studying the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced enhancement of neurite outgrowth. nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in pc cells involves an induction of microtubule assembly. microtubules are formed from α and β tubulin proteins, which form head to tail protofilaments. studies have shown that protein kinase c activation enhances the polymerization of tubulin to form microtubules. schultz et al. have also demonstrated that microtubules containing phosphorylated tubulin are more stable than those containing unphosphorylated tubulin, although it remains unclear whether tubulin phosphorylation is the cause or the result of microtubule stabilization. pkc also modulates the activity of several microtubule associated proteins, including those involved in microtubule polymerization and vesicle transport. specific isoforms of pkc have also been implicated in mediating ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. using both antisense oligonucleotides and specific inhibitors of pkc delta, corbit et al. have demonstrated that this isoform of pkc is required for ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. other studies have found that in pc cells which over-express pkc epsilon, there is an enhancement of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth, while pc cells which over-express a dominant negative inhibitor of pkc epsilon show an inhibition of neurite outgrowth. thus, both the epsilon and delta isoforms of pkc have been implicated in modulation of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth. it is possible that the enhancement of ngf-induced neurite outgrowth produced by chronic ethanol may be due to ethanol's known alterations of pkc signaling. chronic ethanol has multiple effects on pkc, including altered pkc subcellular localization following chronic exposure. messing et al. have shown that chronic ethanol exposure actually increases total cellular content of pkc delta and epsilon in pc cells. however, other studies have shown that membrane-associated pkc activity is down-regulated following chronic ethanol exposure. thus, while total cellular content of pkc may increase with chronic ethanol exposure, membrane-associated pkc may be down-regulated. interestingly, hundle et al. have shown, using pc cells which over-express an inhibitory fragment of either delta or epsilon pkc, that pkc epsilon is required for ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. in this study, we examined the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton using pc cells as a model system. here we show that chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content, while decreasing free-tubulin content. thus, it appears that ethanol enhances microtubule polymerization in pc cells. we also investigated the role of microtubule polymerization in mediating ethanol's effects on neurite outgrowth using pc cells which over-express an inhibitory fragment of either delta or epsilon pkc. importantly, it is the pkc epsilon isoform which is required for ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. here, we found that the pkc delta isoform, but not the pkc epsilon isoform, is required for the enhancement of microtubule polymerization following treatment with chronic ethanol. thus, it appears that neurite outgrowth does not correlate with enhanced microtubule polymerization in pc cells.  chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content in pc cells for the following studies, we used mm ethanol for four days as a chronic exposure; a dose and duration used by previous researchers to demonstrate ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. this is a concentration of ethanol which can easily be achieved by chronic alcoholics. figure demonstrates that following a hour exposure to mm ethanol, there was approximately a 13% increase in polymerized microtubules compared to control cells. similarly, there was a significant decrease in free-tubulin concentration following hours of ethanol exposure. there was no effect on total tubulin expression following four days of chronic ethanol exposure. chronic ethanol exposure in pkc dominant-negative pc cells we next used pc cells which over-express the first variable domain of pkc epsilon or delta, which acts as an isozyme specific inhibitor of pkc epsilon or delta, respectively, to investigate the role of pkc in ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization. interestingly, in the cells which express the inhibitor of pkc epsilon, we found that chronic ethanol exposure significantly increased microtubule content and decreased tubulin content. in the cells which express the inhibitor of pkc delta, there was no significant effect on microtubule or tubulin content. ethanol had no effect on total tubulin content in either the dne or dnd cells. there was no difference between the control vector transfected pc cells and wild-type pc cells, thus these groups were combined and expressed in figure importantly, for both the dne and dnd experiments, these experiments were replicated in two different sub-clones of transfected pc cells. in other words, we had two strains of dominant-negative pkc epsilon cells and two strains of dominant-negative pkc cells. results were similar between the two epsilon lines and between the two delta lines. discussion cells maintain a balance between free tubulin in the cytoplasm and tubulin which is polymerized into microtubules of the cytoskeleton. in this study, we find that chronic ethanol exposure increases microtubule content while decreasing free tubulin content in pc cells. ethanol appears to be enhancing polymerization of tubulin into microtubules. while there was no increase in total tubulin within the cells, there was a change in the proportion of tubulin in the polymerized versus non-polymerized state. we initially hypothesized that the increase in microtubule content was due to ethanol's enhancement of neurite outgrowth. presumably, neurite outgrowth is not due to simple stability of microtubules, but to an increase in dynamic microtubule growth. microtubules are particularly abundant along the axons of nerve cells and multiple labs have show that chronic ethanol exposure increases ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in pc cells. therefore, since the cells that were exposed to ethanol have increased neurite outgrowth, this could be reflected as an increase in microtubles. however, it is not clear that there would necessarily be a concomitant decrease in free tubulin content or what effect of ethanol may have on microtubule stability, per se. our data from experiments utilizing pc cells which express dominant negative inhibitors of pkc do not seem to support the idea that the increased microtubule content reflects increased neurite outgrowth. hundle et al. have demonstrated the specificity of these inhibitory fragments by measuring pma-induced translocation of pkc epsilon and delta to the particulate fraction of the cells using western blotting with isoform specific antibodies. they show that pkc epsilon, but not pkc delta, translocation was specifically inhibited in the cells expressing the epsilon inhibitory fragment. further, pkc delta, but not pkc epsilon, was specifically inhibited in the cells expressing the delta inhibitory fragment. thus demonstrating that the delta and epsilon inhibitory fragments selectively inhibit pma-induced translocation of their corresponding pkc isozymes. hundle et al has shown, using these same cells, that chronic ethanol exposure enhances ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in control cells and cells expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of pkc delta but not in cells expressing the inhibitor of the epsilon isoform of pkc. while it was not a goal of the current study to measure neurite outgrowth, daily observation of the cells was that neurite outgrowth was most dramatic in wild-type cells, slightly less so in the dnd cells, and very limited in dne cells. the work of hundle et al suggests that pkc epsilon but not pkc delta is involved in the effect of ethanol on neurite outgrowth. therefore, we would have predicted that ethanol would cause an increase in microtubule content in dnd cells but not in the dne cells which do not have increased neurite outgrowth. however, we found that chronic ethanol enhances polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in dominant-negative pkc epsilon cells but not dominant-negative delta cells. thus it appears that the delta isoform is involved in ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization. further, our data suggest that neurite outgrowth does not correlate with enhanced microtubule polymerization in pc cells. interestingly, pkc delta has previously been shown to be involved in ngf-induced neurite outgrowth in pc cells. it should be noted however, that our experimental paradigm varied slightly from that of hundle et al. for example, we allowed our cells to differentiate for days prior to beginning ethanol. therefore, apparent discrepancies of our findings with those of hundle et al could be related to these differences. based on our data, we speculate that ethanol's enhancement of microtubule polymerization may involve phosphorylation of tubulin by pkc. however, it should be noted that we have, thus far, not directly measured phosphorylation of tubulin. studies have shown that chronic ethanol increases expression of delta and epsilon pkc in pc cells and pkc activation enhances tubulin polymerization into microtubules. alternatively, chronic ethanol could be acting to alter important microtubule associated proteins. many of these proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins are important for promoting microtubule assembly and it has been shown that pkc phosphorylation mediates the assembly-promoting activity of these proteins. further studies are required to determine the mechanism of ethanol's enhancement of microtubule formation and the apparent role of delta pkc.  our studies demonstrate that chronic ethanol alters the relative ratio of free versus microtubule-associated tubulin content in pc cells, resulting in an increase in microtubule content and a corresponding decrease in free tubulin. this alteration was found to occur in wild type cells, as well as those expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of epsilon pkc but not in cells expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of delta pkc. these ethanol-induced changes could be important during activity-dependent remodeling of synapses or developmental growth of axons and dendrites which may lead to cognitive dysfunction. "," chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to result in changes in neuronal cyto-architecture such as aberrant sprouting and alteration of neurite outgrowth. in pc cells, chronic ethanol treatment produces an increase in nerve growth factor -induced neurite outgrowth that appears to require the epsilon, but not delta, isoform of protein kinase c. neurites contain a core of microtubules that are formed from polymerization of free-tubulin. therefore, it would be expected that an increase in neurite outgrowth would correlate with an increase in microtubule content. we examined the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on microtubule content in pc cells and the role of pkc epsilon and delta in ethanol's effect on microtubule levels.  chronic ethanol exposure of wild-type and vector control pc cells resulted in a significant increase in microtubule content and a corresponding decrease in free tubulin. there was also a significant increase in microtubule content in pc cells expressing a dominate-negative inhibitor of epsilon pkc; cells which have previously been shown to have no ethanol-induced increase in neurite outgrowth. in contrast, ethanol had no effect on microtubule content in pc cells expressing a dominate-negative inhibitor of delta pkc.  these results suggest that chronic ethanol exposure alters the relative ratio of free tubulin to microtubule-associated tubulin, an important component of the cytoskeleton. further, the data from the pkc dominant-negative cell lines suggest that the effects of ethanol on microtubule content do not correlate with the effects of ethanol on neurite outgrowth. the delta isoform of pkc appears to be necessary for the ethanol-induced increase in microtubule content. these studies demonstrate an effect of chronic ethanol exposure which may contribute to previously documented alterations of neuronal cyto-architecture.

87," so-called amoeba-resistant bacteria are characterized by the ability to survive within free-living amoeba trophozoites. some amoeba-resistant species have been further demonstrated to survive within the amoebal cyst which may act as a ""trojan horse"" protecting the organisms from adverse environmental conditions. the amoebal cyst is comprised of the nucleus and the cytoplasm embedded into three successive layers, i.e. the endocyst, the clear region and the outer exocyst. despite the fact that specific location of amoeba-resistant bacteria into the amoebal cyst could modify the outcome of the organisms, precise location of intracystic organisms has not been systematically studied. most of environmental mycobacteria have been demonstrated to be amoeba-resistant organisms also residing into the amoebal cyst. the mycobacterium avium complex organisms have been used as model organisms for environmental mycobacteria, comprising of mycobacteria that are responsible for opportunistic infections and zoonoses. m. avium and mycobacterium intracellulare have been recovered from various sources, including fresh water and hospital water supplies, in which fla are frequently isolated. several experimental studies have further demonstrated m. avium-fla interactions, including acanthamoeba spp. and dictyostelium spp.. m. avium and m. intracellulare have also been grown in the ciliated, unicellular protist tetrahymena pyriformis. it has been demonstrated that m. avium subsp. avium and m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis are able to survive within fla, which results in their increased virulence and protection against adverse situations including exposure to antibiotics. the habitat of the recently described mycobacterium chimaera, isolated from respiratory tract specimens; mycobacterium colombiense, isolated from the blood of an hiv-positive patient and from enlarged lymph nodes in non-immunocompromised children;mycobacterium arosiense isolated from bone lesions; and mycobacterium marseillense, mycobacterium timonense and mycobacterium bouchedurhonense isolated from respiratory tract specimens, remains however unknown. mac species exhibit on-going evolutionary divergence as evidenced by the - % ani between the genomes of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis k and m. avium strain, the % 16s rrna gene divergence between m. avium and m. timonense and between m. avium and m. chimaera, and the % rpob gene sequence divergence between m. avium and m. colombiense. using optic microscopy, electron microscopy and culturing methods, we herein used the mac species as model organisms to study the location of environmental mycobacteria into the amoebal cyst and we further compared these observations with previously published data to find out that residing into the exocyst is a unique characteristic of environmental mycobacteria among amoeba-resistant organisms.  the mac strains studied survived, but did not grow, after a 24-hour incubation in page's modified neff's amoeba saline at 32°c. microscopic examination of infected amoeba demonstrated that all mac organisms were entrapped in a. polyphaga trophozoites and were visible in 3- to 5-μm large ""mycobacterium containing vacuoles"" as early as hours post-infection; to such vacuoles were observed per infected amoeba. the mean number of ""mycobacterium containing vacuoles"" was not statistically different between the various mac species. electron microscopy observations revealed that, in the ""mycobacterium containing vacuoles"" containing only one organism, there was a close apposition of the vacuole membrane all over the mycobacterial cell surface, which was tightly apposed all over the organism cell wall, in contrast to organisms in vacuoles that contained several organisms as previously described in macrophages. in this study, we did not resolved whether the presence of several mycobacteria within one vacuole resulted from the uptake of clumped mycobacteria, the replication of mycobacteria or the coalescence of several, single-organism vacuoles remains undetermined. in any case, our observations agree with previous studies that m. avium is initially entrapped in the vacuoles of amoebal trophozoites and macrophages. in dictyostelium, m. avium accumulated within vacuoles decorated with vacuolin, the dictyostelium flotilin homologue, but it did not break the vacuole membrane, in contrast to mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium marinum. this result was linked to the absence of a particular region of difference, which in m. tuberculosis and m. marinum, encodes a type seven secretion system along with secreted effectors. electron microscopy further disclosed that the mac strains under study were entrapped inside of the a. polyphaga cysts. in all cases, the intracystic organisms were localized within the exocyst. in addition, m. marseillense could be observed in the clear region between the exocyst and the endocyst and in the inner side of the endocyst, and this was also the situation for m. intracellulare. we further observed that a 36-hour exposure of the cysts to hcl did not affect the viability of the cysts, as new trophozoites emerged after 7-day incubation in peptone yeast extract-glucose media at 32°c as determined by light microscopy. sub-culturing such trophozoites on middlebrook 7h agar yielded mycobacteria for all of the mac species under study after a 15-day incubation, whereas the cyst washing fluid remained sterile. interestingly, we observed that these mycobacteria occupied a preferential location within the amoebal exocyst, where they were found in-between the two layers of the exocyst. among the several mycobacterium species reported to survive within amoebal cysts, such a particular feature has been previously illustrated only for m. avium in a. polyphaga cysts; m. smegmatis; m. abscessus, m. chelonae and m. septicum; and m. xenopi. among intra-amoebal bacteria, location within the exocyst has also been reported for simkania negevensis, despite the fact that s. negevensis organisms could also be observed within the cytoplasm of the cyst, depending on the strain under study. location within exocyst wall contrasts with the observation of legionella pneumophila, which was found within the cytoplasm of pre-cysts and mature cysts of a. polyphaga or non-entrapped within amoebal cysts. reviewing published data regarding amoebal-resistant bacterial species found that 11/ mycobacterium species versus 1/ non-mycobacterium amoebal-resistant bacterial species have been reported to survive within a. polyphaga exocyst. as both l. pneumophila and mycobacteria are pathogens, the intracystic location of organisms may not influence their virulence. the mechanisms and biological significance of this particular location remain to be studied. it has been established that a. polyphaga exocyst is composed of cellulose and the authors have observed that mycobacteria encode one cellulose-binding protein and one or two cellulases which are indeed transcribed. cellulase encoded by mycobacteria may play a role in their unique exocyst location. moreover, we observed that all mac species can survive within such a. polyphaga cyst. this occurrence did not merely result from the potential contamination of the amoeba by extra-amoebal mycobacteria, since we destroyed any mac organism left on the surface of cysts by incubating the cysts in hcl, a method previously demonstrated to kill remaining trophozoites, immature cysts and extra-amoebal m. avium. we checked the efficacy of this process by incubating the rinsing buffer on middlebrook and found no growth of mycobacteria, which indicated that the hcl had indeed destroyed any extracystic mac organisms. the fact that all of the mac species survived in the exocyst may be relevant to the persistence of these organisms in the environment despite adverse conditions. non-tuberculous mycobacteria, including m. avium, have been shown to persist up to months in drinking water systems despite filtration and ozonation. also, m. intracellulare and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria have been shown to be protected against mg/liter of free-chlorine for hours by entrapment within a. polyphaga cysts. therefore, free-living amoeba cysts may be a ""trojan horse"" for mac organisms and protect them from adverse environmental conditions, including high concentrations of chlorine, as previously reported for other environmental mycobacteria.  the data presented herein on mac species illustrate that survival within the amoebal exocyst is a significant feature of environmental mycobacteria. this particular location, preserving mycobacteria from adverse environment, nevertheless allow them to rapidly escape from the amoebal cyst. the mechanisms for such unique location remain to be established in environmental mycobacteria. "," most of environmental mycobacteria have been previously demonstrated to resist free-living amoeba with subsequent increased virulence and resistance to antibiotics and biocides. the mycobacterium avium complex comprises of environmental organisms that inhabit a wide variety of ecological niches and exhibit a significant degree of genetic variability. we herein studied the intra-ameobal location of all members of the mac as model organisms for environmental mycobacteria.  type strains for m. avium, mycobacterium intracellulare, mycobacterium chimaera, mycobacterium colombiense, mycobacterium arosiense, mycobacterium marseillense, mycobacterium timonense and mycobacterium bouchedurhonense were co-cultivated with the free-living amoeba acanthamoeba polyphaga strain linc-ap microscopic analyses demonstrated the engulfment and replication of mycobacteria into vacuoles of a. polyphaga trophozoites. mycobacteria were further entrapped within amoebal cysts, and survived encystment as demonstrated by subculturing. electron microscopy observations show that, three days after entrapment into a. polyphaga cysts, all mac members typically resided within the exocyst.  combined with published data, these observations indicate that mycobacteria are unique among amoeba-resistant bacteria, in residing within the exocyst.

88," it is well established that enhanced bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide affords cardioprotection against ischemia and reoxygenation-induced injury. this important mediator is enzymatically produced by the no-synthases. there are three nos isoforms, widely distributed through most cells and tissues, which can produce no by converting l-arginine to l-citruline in the presence of nadph, o and other co-factors. the endothelial nos and neuronal nos are constitutive and ca++-dependent whereas the expression of the inducible nos is ca++-independent and stress-induced. it has been documented that nnos is located in the peripheral vagal nerves, sympathetic nerves and in the autonomic control region of the central nervous system. in cardiomyocytes, nnos is expressed in sarcoplasmic reticulum, sarcolemma and mitochondria. no derived from nnos influences the beat to beat regulation of basal cardiac function, serving negative feedback control of ca++ fluxes. in addition, it facilitates vagal stimulation and inhibits sympathetic stimulation by exerting its effect in the central and peripheral nervous system. no derived from enos is essential for eliciting early ischemic preconditioning, however, there is still controversy about the role of nnos. thus, although nnos expression is increased in the acute phase of myocardial infarction in both infarcted and non-infarcted tissues in the rat heart, it has been reported that in the nnos knockout mice, there is no change in myocardial infarct size. by contrast, it appears that delayed ip is dependent on nnos in the rabbit, whereas the deficit of nnos reduces cerebral ischemic injury in mice. mitokatp channels, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, are central for ip. few studies have shown a link between mitokatp and no in ip. sasaki et al suggested that no causes the opening of mitokatp directly and indirectly which in turn induces blunting of the ca++ overload in mitochondria, thus contributing to the delayed ip. it has also been reported that the opening of the mitokatp channels by diazoxide induces cardioprotection in a no-dependent manner. furthermore, rakhit et al have demonstrated that the exogenous no donor snap induces early ip by a cgmp-dependent mechanism and delayed ip by a cgmp-independent mechanism which is mediated by activation of pkc and mitokatp channels. interestingly, nakano et al suggested that snap-induced cardioprotection cannot be reproduced by endogenous no also implying that there are two separate pathways for no-induced cardioprotection. our laboratory has previously demonstrated that opening of p38mapk is an obligatory step in ip that lies downstream of pkc activation. however, there is little information regarding the relationship of no with p38mapk in the myocardium. thus, for example, kim et al. showed that sodium nitroprusside activates p42/ and p38mapk in adult rat cardiomyocytes via both cgmp-dependent and cgmp-independent mechanisms. in another study, wang et al demonstrated that no suppressed the angiotensin-i induced activation of erk in cardiac fibroblast. other studies carried out in non-cardiac mitogenic cells have shown that no induced apoptosis is mediated directly by activation of mapk. so, the relationship of no with p38mapk remains largely undefined. therefore, the aims of the present studies were to: elucidate the role of nnos in ischemia/reoxygenation-induced injury and ip, determine whether its effect is species-dependent, and investigate the relationship of nnos with mitokatp channels and p38mapk, two key components of the intracellular transduction pathway of protection by ip.  myocardial viability, as assessed by the absence of necrosis and apoptosis by the end of the experimental period in aerobically incubated myocardial slices, was greater than 95% in all instances. the role of nnos in ischemic injury figures 1a-c show that, in the rat myocardium, the selective inhibition of nnos by trim resulted in a significant reduction in ck release and in cell necrosis and apoptosis, as compared to the mean values in the ischemia/reoxygenation alone group. the degree of this protection was similar to administration of exogenous no but greater than the non-selective nos inhibitor l-name. is the role of nnos species-dependent? as seen in figures 2a-f, and in comparison with the results observed in figures 1a-c, the order of magnitude of ischemic injury for ck release and cell necrosis and apoptosis varied slightly between species, however, identical effects on nos inhibition and from the administration of exogenous no to that seen in rat myocardium were observed for both mouse and human myocardium. knocking out nnos figures 3a-c demonstrate that, as opposed to wild type mice, the myocardium of nnos knockout mice could not be protected by the specific nos inhibitor trim as the mean values for ck release and cell necrosis and apoptosis were not significantly different from muscles subjected to ischemia/reoxygenation alone. the absence of benefit when l-name was added to the myocardium of knockout nnos mice supports the thesis that although the endogenously produced no by enos may be beneficial its deficit did not cause further ischemic injury. as seen above, again the no donor snap almost abolished the ck release and the cell death induced by ischemia and reoxygenation. importantly, and in contrast with wild type mice, the myocardium of nnos knockout out mice could not be protected by ip since the mean values for ck release and cell necrosis and apoptosis did not differ from the values in the ischemia/reoxygenation alone group. however, the degree of injury in the ischemia-reoxygenation alone groups was similar in both wild type and nnos knockout mice as previously reported. the relationship of exogenous no and nnos inhibition with mitokatp channels and p38mapk figures 4a-c demonstrate that the reduction in ck release and in cell necrosis and apoptosis caused by the no donor snap and the inhibition of nnos with trim, was unaffected by the mitokatp channel blocker 5-hd, and that, as expected, it blocked the protection by ip. by contrast, figures 5a-c show that the p38mapk blocker sb abolished the protective effect of exogenous no and of nnos inhibition, along with the benefit of ip. discussion and  the present studies have demonstrated that nnos plays a dual role so that its presence is necessary to afford cardioprotection by ip, but at the same time its inhibition reduces myocardial ischemic/reoxygenation induced injury. in addition, they have shown that the protection obtained by the inhibition of nnos is as potent as the exogenous administration of no and that of ip, effects that are species-independent. importantly, the action of nnos and those of exogenous no are exerted downstream of mitokatp channels and upstream of p mapk. the duplicity of nnos-derived effects seen in our studies can be explained, on one hand by a physiological production of no that triggers the cardioprotective intracellular mechanism of interventions such as ip, and on the other hand by a possible much greater production of no induced by ischemia/reoxygenation that is detrimental. in this connection, other investigators have also reported in an infarct size model that nnos plays an opposite role in ischemia/reperfusion and ip and that the protection of delayed ip in the rabbit heart is dependent on nnos. since no donors such as snap also have strong cardioprotective effects, it may be speculated that the amount and cell location of no production would determine whether the final result is tissue protection or injury. it is also interesting to note that myocardial injury was not increased by ischemia/reoxygenation in nnos knockout mice, a finding supported by the absence of changes in infarct size in nnos knockout mice. by contrast, a deficit in nnos in mice reduced the degree of cerebral ischemic injury, thus suggesting that the role of nnos in ischemia/reoxygenation could be organ-specific. our studies locate the action of nnos downstream of the mitokatp channels since the protection induced by nnos specific inhibitor trim was blocked by 5-hd, a mitokatp channel inhibitor. the finding that exogenous no is also acting at the same point reinforces the view that the production of endogenous no by nnos is the mechanism of protection. indeed, other laboratories have shown that the protection induced by exogenous no is not affected by blockade of mitokatp channels with 5hd or glibenclamide and that the protection induced by the mitokatp channel opener diazoxide is no-dependent, further supporting the thesis that no metabolism is a critical component of the cell survival mechanism. the different location of the two constitutive forms of nos, nnos and enos, may also suggest that no plays a distinctive role depending on the cellular site where it is produced. this thesis gets support from the finding that the specific inhibition of nnos was more protective than the non-specific inhibition of nos. certainly, this is an important question that would require further investigations. previously, our laboratory has shown that p38mapk is another critical factor of ip-induced cardioprotection located beyond the mitokatp channels. here we have also shown that the effect of no metabolism in the intracellular signaling pathways of cardioprotection is exerted upstream of p38mapk, as the beneficial effects of exogenous no donation and nnos inhibition were abolished by the p38mapk blocker sb these findings are supported by the demonstration of protection of cardiac and non-cardiac cells, by no through activation of p38mapk and other mapks. an additional important finding is the identical role played by nnos in the three species studied, suggesting that the function of the enzyme has been preserved throughout evolution. these results may have clinical implications since the findings observed from the animal studies could be extrapolated to human beings without the need for additional confirmatory investigations. nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing that the present studies were performed in an in vitro model and therefore care must be taken when extrapolating the present results to clinical conditions. however, despite the differences between atrial and ventricular samples, the myocardium from the mouse and rat ventricles and from the human right atrial appendage, responded in a similar manner and hence the different source of myocardium should not represent a problem for the interpretation of the results. during cardiac surgery, myocardial ischemia is induced in a controlled manner and therefore it would be possible to enhance cardioprotection by manipulation of the no metabolism. however, in the clinical setup, the heart may be subjected to stresses that can result in the expression of the inducible nos and it would be important to elucidate the role of the constitutive nos isoforms, nnos and enos, in the pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury under such conditions. it is worth emphasizing that, although the activity of nnos has been shown to be increased in the late phase of delayed ip, to the best of our knowledge, the activity of the enzyme has not been determined in early ip. indeed, it would be important to determine the activity of all nos isoforms in future studies. in conclusion, here we have shown that nnos is a critical factor playing a dual role by participating in myocardial ischemia/reoxygenation injury, and at the same time, by promoting myocardial protection. these results are of clinical relevance for the design of therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the myocardial damage caused by ischemia/reoxygenation. "," nitric oxide is cardioprotective and a mediator of ischemic preconditioning. endothelial nitric oxide synthase is protective against myocardial ischemic injury and a component of ip but the role and location of neuronal nitric oxide synthase remains unclear. therefore, the aims of these studies were to: investigate the role of nnos in ischemia/reoxygenation-induced injury and ip, determine whether its effect is species-dependent, and elucidate the relationship of nnos with mitokatp channels and p38mapk, two key components of ip transduction pathway.  ventricular myocardial slices from rats and wild and nnos knockout mice, and right atrial myocardial slices from human were subjected to min ischemia and min reoxygenation. specimens were randomized to receive various treatments. both the provision of exogenous no and the inhibition of endogenous no production significantly reduced tissue injury, an effect that was species-independent. the cardioprotection seen with nnos inhibition was as potent as that of ip, however, in nnos knockout mice the cardioprotective effect of non-selective nos and selective nnos inhibition and also that of ip was blocked while the benefit of exogenous no remained intact. additional studies revealed that the cardioprotection afforded by exogenous no and by inhibition of nnos were unaffected by the mitokatp channel blocker 5-hd, although it was abrogated by p38mapk blocker sb  nnos plays a dual role in ischemia/reoxygenation in that its presence is necessary to afford cardioprotection by ip and its inhibition reduces myocardial ischemic injury. the role of nnos is species-independent and exerted downstream of the mitokatp channels and upstream of p38mapk.

89," toxoplasma gondii is a widely distributed parasite infecting warm-blooded animals including the water buffalo. toxoplasmosis in humans may be a severe disease affecting the lymph nodes, eyes, and central nervous system and can be life-threatening mostly in immunocompromised patients. water buffaloes are important to the economy of many countries and in mexico they represent an emerging alternative for diversified livestock production. in asia, water buffaloes are the major source of milk and milk products, and their meat is consumed by humans in several countries. in general, buffaloes, like cattle, are considered resistant to clinical toxoplasmosis and there is no valid report of isolation of viable t. gondii from buffalo meat. recently, dehkordi et al. reported isolation of viable t. gondii from milk of of buffaloes in iran, but the validity of these results has been questioned. this report has raised concerns regarding transmission of t. gondii by consuming raw products from buffaloes. we are not aware of any report of t. gondii infection in water buffaloes from mexico. the objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and correlates of t. gondii infection in water buffaloes raised in several municipalities in veracruz, mexico. methods water buffaloes surveyed water buffaloes from geographical regions of veracruz, mexico were sampled from september to august these water buffaloes ranged freely and grazed on natural pastures. sampling was based on accessibility to ranches raising buffaloes in the mexican state of veracruz that shares its eastern border with the gulf of mexico. water buffaloes were located in ranches throughout these municipalities: isla, juan rodriguez clara, las choapas, and sayula de alemán. a questionnaire was used to obtain the general characteristics of the buffalo herds including age, sex, weight, breed, and obstetric history. additionally, environmental data were recorded including presence of common water source shared with other animals in the ranch, cohabitation with other animals, and climatic conditions. the age of the buffaloes ranged from to 11 years old, were males, and females. three water buffalo breeds were represented: murrah, carabao, and jafarabadi. ethics statement this project was approved by the bioethics and animal welfare commission of the facultad de medicina veterinaria y zootecnia of universidad veracruzana. consent was obtained from the owners of the buffaloes. serological examination for t. gondii antibodies serum samples were obtained and stored at −20°c until tested. testing for t. gondii antibodies in the buffaloes’ sera was performed using 2-fold serial dilutions from 1: to 1: with the modified agglutination test as described by dubey and desmonts. a titer of 1: was used as cut off for seropositivity in the mat. statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with the aid of epi info version. software. the pearson’s chi-squared test was used for comparison of the frequencies among groups. the association between the buffaloes’ characteristics and t. gondii seropositivity was assessed by multivariable analysis. the dependent variable was seropositivity to t. gondii by mat for an individual animal. independent variables included in the multivariable analysis were those with a p value ≤ in the bivariate analysis: region, municipality, altitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual rainfall, and common water source. odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated by multivariate analysis using backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. the hosmer-lemeshow goodness of fit test was used to assess the fitness of the regression model. statistical significance was set at a p value of < .  antibodies to t. gondii were found in of the buffaloes with mat titers of 1: in 1: in and 1: in 9; none of the samples had a higher titer. seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was significantly higher in buffaloes in the olmeca region than in the papaloapan region. all ranches had seropositive buffaloes, and seroprevalence in buffaloes varied significantly among ranches. a correlation of t. gondii seropositivity rates and environmental characteristics is shown in table  the seroprevalence varied among municipalities. the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was significantly higher in buffaloes at 80– meters above sea level than those at 10– meters above sea level. the seroprevalence in warm climate was similar to the one in warm-humid climate. in contrast, the seroprevalence was significantly higher in municipalities with 27°c of mean annual temperature than in those with -25°c mean annual temperature. in addition, seroprevalence varied among mean annual rainfall, the seroprevalence was significantly higher in municipalities with 1266–1650 mm of mean annual rainfall than those with 2316–2900 mm of mean annual rainfall.table seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in water buffaloes in veracruz, mexico meters above sea level c mean annual temperature d mean annual rainfall e buffaloes tested seropositivity to t. gondii region a municipality b climate no. no. % astatistically significant difference in seroprevalences among regions. bstatistically significant difference in seroprevalences among municipalities. cstatistically significant difference in seroprevalences among masl. dsignificantly higher seroprevalence at 27°c than at -25°c matp. estatistically significant difference in seroprevalences among mar. table  shows the correlation of t. gondii seropositivity rates and the general characteristics of the buffaloes. seroprevalence of t. gondii infection did not vary with age, sex, breed, weight, and type of buffaloes, and with sharing of water, or contact with cattle. the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was similar in female buffaloes with abortion history than in female buffaloes without abortion history. all buffaloes had contact with cats and dogs.table correlation of general characteristics of the buffaloes and seroprevalence of t. gondii infection buffaloes tested seroprevalence of t. gondii infection characteristics no. no. % p value environmental and buffaloes characteristics with a p value equal to or less than in the bivariate analysis included region, municipality, altitude, a mean annual temperature of 27°c, mean annual rainfall, and water sharing. multivariate analysis of such characteristics showed that t. gondii seropositivity in buffaloes was associated only with a mean annual rainfall between 1266–1650 mm. the result of the hosmer-lemeshow test was which indicates an acceptable fit of our regression model. discussion our results indicate that water buffaloes in veracruz, mexico have a relatively high seroprevalence of t. gondii infection. the worldwide prevalence of t. gondii infection in water buffaloes until was reviewed previously, and seroprevalences varied from 0% to 100% by using mat. since then, a few additional papers were published on this subject. antibodies to t. gondii were found in of water buffaloes from northern brazil. they used an in-house elisa and the cut-off titer for ifat was 1:. in a report from southern brazil, antibodies were found in of water buffaloes by ifat; sera were run at 1: and 1: dilutions and the seropositivity results were based on a titer of 1:. in a study in argentina, researchers found t. gondii antibodies in of buffaloes by ifat using a 1: cut off titer. using the same mat that we used, t. gondii antibodies were found in of water buffaloes in iran; most of the buffaloes had low titers. in most parts of the world water buffaloes are domesticated and probably acquire t. gondii by ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts shed by infected domestic cats. water buffaloes in the present report ranged freely and had contact with domestic and wild cats. further research is needed to understand the dynamics of feline-buffalo transmission under free-ranging conditions in veracruz, mexico. in the present study water buffaloes living in municipalities with a mean annual rainfall of 1266–1650 mm had a higher seroprevalence than those living in municipalities with higher mean annual rainfall. it is not clear why a lower mean annual rainfall is associated with higher seroprevalence of t. gondii infection. it is possible that a higher mean annual rainfall might be accompanied with higher erosion of contaminated soil. in addition, copious rainfalls may dilute oocysts in contaminated water that might in turn lower the risk for t. gondii infection. although we are unable to explain why other environmental factors were associated with t. gondii infection, it has been postulated that shifts in environmental conditions can increase the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in susceptible hosts. environmental factors influencing the degree of oocysts exposure may also cause the difference in seropositivity among ranches as noted in water buffaloes from trinidad. there are no data regarding seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in cats among municipalities in veracruz state. it would be of interest to test domestic and wild cats in the region for t. gondii infection. nothing is known of the validity of different serological tests used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in buffaloes. we are not aware of any serious attempts at isolation of viable t. gondii from tissues of naturally exposed buffaloes. buffaloes, like cattle, are considered resistant to clinical toxoplasmosis and we are not aware of any report of clinical toxoplasmosis in buffaloes. based on studies with naturally and experimentally infected cattle, the mat gave the best results for determining antibodies to t. gondii in cattle, and titers < 1: were considered nonspecific. a comparison of serological and bioassay data on naturally infected buffaloes is required to determine if the same criteria apply for mat diagnosis of t. gondii infection in water buffaloes. the reported high excretion of viable t. gondii in milk of naturally infected buffaloes from iran by dehkordi et al. needs confirmation. further research should be conducted to determine the role of consumption of raw or undercooked meat from buffaloes in the transmission of t. gondii infection to humans.  results of the present study indicate that buffaloes in veracruz state have a high t. gondii exposure. further research is needed to determine the risk of ingestion of raw or undercook buffalo meat for t. gondii infection in humans. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors’ contributions cae performed the laboratory tests, data analysis, and wrote the manuscript. drs designed the study protocol, obtained the blood samples and general data of the buffaloes, analyzed the results, and helped in the writing of the manuscript. zgv analyzed the results. acr, apc, nip, and mad obtained the blood samples and general data of the buffaloes, and analyzed the results. aapl performed the data analysis and helped in the writing of the manuscript. jpd analyzed the results and wrote the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript.

90," methods for constructing a phylogeny given a set of the dna sequences is always a popular topic in both biological and statistical research. many classical methods are popular, such as neighbor-joining method, maximum parsimony method, maximum likelihood method, and bayesian approaches. there are also many programs which implement these methods, including phylip, paup, and mega. chen and lindsay introduced a mixture likelihood algorithm as a novel and natural way to deal with such problems because the distribution of offsprings' sequence is a mixture of parental distributions. unlike the classic methods, this approach uses the frequencies of each sequence within the population to help reconstructing the phylogeny from binary sequences. the model proposed by chen and lindsay was done mathematically, as a first step, and that it should not be particularly problematic with most snps are bi-allelic with only a very small proportion tri-allelic or quad-allelic. the algorithm uses a k-component bernoulli mixture to model binary sequences. it is well-known that when the parameter takes values in an infinite dimensional space, the maximum likelihood estimation often fails. to overcome the above issue, we can first maximize over a constrained subspace of the parameter space then relax the constraint as the sample size grows. in this case, the maximum likelihood estimation will then work. the parameter used to create a constrained subspace is called a sieve parameter. in our case, the sieve parameter is the mutation rate p which is considered as a function of time in the mixture model. by varying p from to, the mixture algorithm can give an estimate of the recent common ancestors of the given sequences. in order to obtain the mixture tree of the observed sequences, the expectation-maximization algorithm is employed. to overcome the small weights problem in the regular em, the nature way comes up is that we do not update the weights π. such an algorithm, we call it fixem. the modal em is a nonparametric statistical approach to clustering via mode identification in the bernoulli mixtures. the mixturetree program contains the regular em algorithm plus these two related optimization algorithms, fixed em algorithm and modal em algorithm. any and all can be chosen to estimate the ancestral sequences. we have found that the fixem and modalem algorithms have better computational efficiency over the regular em algorithm. after constructing the phylogeny, it is common for researchers to carry out a nonparametric bootstrap analysis in which one creates bootstrap samples from the empirical distribution of sites from the original sequence data. the mixturetree algorithm also implements a majority-rule consensus tree method from phylip. this method is originally proposed by margush and mcmorris and also allows one to easily find the strict consensus tree. implementation the input function in the mixturetree program can read dna sequences in a simple tabular format, in which all the sequences should be stacked in the form: sequence name   sequence   sequence' s frequency the parameters setting can be changed in the parameter file. three different optimization options can be chosen in the algorithm. the output function of the program writes the estimated mixture tree in the commonly-used newick format which can be read, viewed, and manipulated by many other programs. whether the em algorithm converges can be checked in the output file em.txt. if chosen as an option, the bootstrap trees will also be output in newick format. the summary of the bootstrap trees will be in a separate le. all of the output trees can be easily imported into other packages, such as the r package ape for further manipulations. details can be found in the userguide at http://math.asu.edu/~scchen/mixturetree.html.  in order to evaluate the efficiency of the mixturetree algorithm, we generated a sample of size by using the simulator ms with five lineages in each sample unit. the simulator generates the true phylogeny along with the lineages, so we reconstruct the mixture tree, neighbor-joining tree and maximum parsimony tree based on the simulated lineages and then compare them with the true tree by using the robinson and foulds metric. the metric proposed by robinson and foulds is based on elementary operations on transforming one tree to another tree in order to compare two tree topologies. by comparing the distances of trees, we can make conclusion of tree a is closer to tree b rather than to tree c. for each simulation we also calculate the distances among the mixture tree, neighbor-joining tree, maximum parsimony tree and maximum likelihood tree then we sum over the distances from those simulations. in the simulation study, we simulated sets of sequences using various mutation rates. for each set of sequences the length of the sequences was snps and the number of lineages was with small mutation rates, we received very similar results. for example, with mutation rate the sum of the distances of these simulations for mixturetree, nj tree, mp tree, and ml tree are and the three methods, except ml tree, were about as different from each other as they were from the true tree, showing that the new mixture tree method is fundamentally different from the other two. the sum of the pairwise distances of mixture v.s. nj, mixture v.s. mp, nj v.s. mp, mixture v.s. ml, nj v.s. ml, mp v.s. ml are and shows that the performance of mixturetree is closer to nj tree. the results are presented using histograms in figure  from the comparison above, we can see that the efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than the other three methods. however, there are also some shortcomings of the mixture algorithm, for example, it is more time-consuming to obtain the phylogeny than the other two methods. this shortcoming can be solved by implementing the fixed em or modal em instead of the traditional em algorithm. availability and requirements the mixturetree construction project and source codes can be found in the link

91," all-beta membrane proteins constitute a well structurally conserved class of proteins, that span the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria with a barrel-like structure. in all cases known so far with atomic resolution, the barrel consists of an even number of anti-parallel beta strands, whose number ranges from to strands, depending on the protein and/or its functional role. in eukaryotes, it is known that similar architectures are present in the outer membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria, although so far none of the so-called ""porins"", mainly acting as voltage dependent anion channels, have been solved with atomic resolution. it is therefore urgent to devise methods for the prediction of the topology of this class of membrane proteins. indeed the correct prediction of the protein topology, given the conservation of the barrel architecture may greatly help in threading procedures, especially when sequence homology is low. furthermore reliable methods, endowed with a low rate of false positives, can also help in genome annotation on the basis of protein structure prediction. the problem of predicting beta barrel membrane proteins has been recently addressed with machine learning approaches, and among them hidden markov models have been shown to outperform previously existing methods. hmms were developed for alignments, pattern detection and also for predictions, as in the case of the topology of all-alpha and all-beta membrane proteins. when hmms are implemented for predicting a given feature, a decoding algorithm is needed. with decoding we refer to the assignment of a path through the hmm states given an observed sequence o. in this way, we can also assign a label to each sequence element. more generally, as stated in, the decoding is the prediction of the labelsof an unknownpath. the most famous decoding procedure is the viterbi algorithm, which finds the most probable allowed path through the hmm model. viterbi decoding is particularly effective when there is a single best path among others much less probable. when several paths have similar probabilities, the posterior decoding or the 1-best algorithms are more convenient. the posterior decoding assigns the state path on the basis of the posterior probability, although the selected path might be not allowed. in this paper we address the problem of preserving the automaton grammar and concomitantly exploiting the posterior probabilities, without the need of the post-processing algorithm. prompted by this, we design a new decoding algorithm, the posterior-viterbidecoding, which preserves the automaton grammars and at thesame time exploits the posterior probabilities. a related idea, that is specific for pairwise alignments was previously introduced to improve the sequence alignment accuracy. we show that pv performs better than the other algorithms when we test it on the problem of predicting the topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins.  testing the decoding algorithms on all-beta membrane proteins in order to test our decoding algorithm on real biological data, we used a previously developed hmm, devised for the prediction of the topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins. the hidden markov model is a sequence-profile-based hmm and takes advantage of emitting vectors instead of symbols, as described in. since the previously designed and trained hmm emits profile vectors, sequence profiles have been computed from the alignments as derived with psi-blast on the non-redundant database of protein sequences. the results obtained using the four different decoding algorithms are shown in table where the performance is tested with a leave-one-out cross validation procedure for the first proteins and as blind-test for the latter. it is evident that for the problem at hand the viterbi decoding and the 1-best are unreliable, since only one of the proteins is correctly assigned. in this case the posterior decoding is more efficient and can correctly assign 60% and 40% of the proteins, in cross-validation and on the blind set, respectively. here the posterior decoding is used without maxsubseq, introduced before to recast the grammar. from table it evident that the new pv decoding is the best performing decoding achieving 80% and 60% accuracy in cross-validation and on the blind set, respectively. this is done ensuring that predictions are consistent with the designed automaton grammar. comparison with other available hmms in table we show the results of the comparison between our hmm-decoding with those obtained from the available web servers, based on similar approaches. the pred-tmbb server allows the user to test three different algorithms. differently from us they find that their hmm does not show significant differences among the three decoding algorithms. this dissimilar behaviour may be due to several concurring facts: i) the different hmm models, ii) pred-tmbb runs on a single-sequence input, iii) pred-tmbb is trained using the conditional maximum likelihood. the second server proftmb is based on a method that exploits multiple sequence information and posterior probabilities. their decoding is related to the posterior-viterbi; however, in their algorithm the authors first obtained the posterior sum contracted into two possible labeling, then they made use of the explicit value of the hmm transition probabilities. in this way they count the transition probabilities twice and the proftmb performance is not very different from ours. finally, the third server hmmb2tmr achieves a performance quite similar to that obtained with pv decoding. to do that hmmb2tmr takes advantage of the maxsubseq algorithm on top of the posterior sum decoding. however, although maxsubseq is a very general two-class segment optimization algorithm, it is a post processing procedure that has to be applied after a hmm decoding. on the contrary, pv is a general decoding algorithm and it is more useful when the underlying predictor is a hmm, where more than two labels and different constraints can be introduced into the automaton grammars.  the new pv decoding algorithm is more convenient in that it overcomes the difficulties of introducing a problem-dependent optimization algorithm when the automaton grammar is to be re-cast. when one-state-path dominates we may expect that pv does not perform better than the other decoding algorithms, and in these cases the 1-best is preferred. nevertheless, we show that when several concurring paths are present, as in the case of our beta-barrel hmm, pv performs better than the others. although pv takes more time than other algorithms, the pv asymptotic computational time-complexity still remains o as for the other decodings. as far as the memory requirement is concerned, pv needs the same space-complexity of the viterbi and posterior ), while 1-best in the average case requires less memory, and can also be reduced. when computational speed is an issue, viterbi algorithm is the fastest and the time complexity order is time ≤ time ≤ time. finally, pv satisfies any hmm grammar structures, including automata containing silent states, and it is applicable to all the possible hmm models with an arbitrary number of labels and without having to work out a problem-dependent optimization algorithm. "," structure prediction of membrane proteins is still a challenging computational problem. hidden markov models have been successfully applied to the problem of predicting membrane protein topology. in a predictive task, the hmm is endowed with a decoding algorithm in order to assign the most probable state path, and in turn the labels, to an unknown sequence. the viterbi and the posterior decoding algorithms are the most common. the former is very efficient when one path dominates, while the latter, even though does not guarantee to preserve the hmm grammar, is more effective when several concurring paths have similar probabilities. a third good alternative is 1-best, which was shown to perform equal or better than viterbi.  in this paper we introduce the posterior-viterbi a new decoding which combines the posterior and viterbi algorithms. pv is a two step process: first the posterior probability of each state is computed and then the best posterior allowed path through the model is evaluated by a viterbi algorithm.  we show that pv decoding performs better than other algorithms when tested on the problem of the prediction of the topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins. 17– march italian society of bioinformatics: annual meeting milan, italy ",a6d7bbd3-e037-433c-a61c-9458e1c8fa47,pubmed
92," the pcr method of dna amplification has had a profound impact on biotechnology and biological research. multiplex pcr is an extension of the standard pcr protocol in which multiple loci are amplified simultaneously in order to save time, improve throughput, and reduce the total cost of reagents. applications for pcr and multiplex pcr abound including quantitative gene expression, haplotyping, whole-genome closure, detection of genetically modified organisms, forensic analysis, including human identification and paternity testing diagnosis of infectious diseases, and for anti-bioterror applications aimed at detecting biological agents such as anthrax multiplex pcr has recently emerged as a core enabling technology for high-throughput snp genotyping, and variations on the standard protocol are being actively explored and in some cases more widely commercialized. it is in this context of genotyping that we focus our discussion of multiplex pcr assay design. thus we will typically refer to multiplexing snps but our treatment is readily applicable to most other pcr applications. genomic variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms and associated haplotypes continue to garner tremendous interest particularly in the context of pharmacogenomic initiatives aimed at understanding the connection between individual genetic traits, drug response, and disease susceptibility. broad adaptation of genotyping technologies in clinical settings will depend on their cost and inherent clinical value and may be significantly impacted by ethical and legal considerations. recent technological developments in pcr-based genotyping based on primer extension with universal pcr primers have demonstrated very high multiplexing levels, although the use of common primers does introduce other issues including the greater potential for cross-contamination. multiplex pcr assay design is a multi-objective optimization problem involving intrinsic performance tradeoffs. the key objectives we consider in this paper include the number of snps per tube and the percentage of snps assigned to full tubes. we further require that all resulting tubes achieve uniform levels of multiplexing with the idea that doing so facilitates automation in a high-throughput environment. while lower coverage may be acceptable in initial survey studies involving many snps, achieving high coverage becomes obviously more important when the focus of investigation has been narrowed to a relatively small set of snps each of which is suspected of having some biological or pharmacological impact. the question we address in this paper is whether there are fundamental limitations to our ability to design assays that achieve multiplexing levels of arbitrary size using standard multiplex pcr protocols. while multiplex pcr is an established technique, its usefulness as the basis for future high-throughput platforms depends critically on scalability. we introduce a new framework of ""multi-node graphs"" to model the multiplex pcr problem. we show that the problem of finding high-multiplexing/high-coverage designs is subject to a computational phase transition, becoming dramatically more difficult when the probability that two primers are mutually compatible drops below a critical threshold. this probability depends on fundamental primer selection criteria typically selected to avoid the formation of primer dimers. for standard criteria, we can identify where such a transition occurs, and show that it is consistent with typical multiplexing levels. the precise location of this critical transition point will also depend on n, the number of available snps. for a given level of coverage, the level of achievable multiplex is proportional to log. we further quantify design performance tradeoffs using two best-fit tube assignment algorithms on human snp data.  phase transitions in multiplex pcr complexity our first main result reported in this section can be succinctly stated as follows: for an assay with n snps and approximately s candidate primers for each snp we devise a relatively efficient algorithm that can achieve almost perfect coverage with tubes of size approximately o. unfortunately the coverage drops dramatically if the multiplex level is increased. this result is similar in spirit to related observations made about other graph problems. in recent years, it has been shown that for broad classes of computationally intractable problems, there exist certain phase-transition boundaries across which the nature of the solutions and the computational effort needed to identify a solution changes dramatically. when attempting to design multiplex pcr assays with high coverage, we observe a similar computational behavior on simulations using a novel graph formulation we call a multi-node graph. this graph representation consists of nodes representing snps and edges connecting two multiplex-compatible snps. two snps are multiplex compatible if none of their associated primers interact. to model the fact that snp compatibility depends on the assigned primers, we allow for the presence of an edge matrix euv. in a multi-node graph, euv = when node u with primer set i is compatible to node v with primer set j. we induced a random multi-node graph by setting euv = with probability p for all node pairs u and v, in states i and j respectively. using a simple greedy algorithm we find that our ability to achieve high coverage for randomly generated multi-node graphs critically depends on the compatibility probability, p, ) as well as the target level of multiplexing. these results are presented in figure by sampling from chromosome of the human genome, the actual probability that two snps are compatible is approximately. figure would suggest, therefore, that designing 10-plex assays from n = snps is generally straightforward, but that increasing multiplex performance to 15- to 20-plex or beyond becomes extremely problematic. this appears to be consistent with current design practice though we emphasize that the location of the phase transition depends on both the total number of snps and the number of candidate primer pairs per snp. we recognize, furthermore, that random multi-node graphs only approximately model the multiplex assay design problem because primer pair candidates derived from real sequence data are not truly independent. for example, primer pairs may share a forward or reverse primer, or they may significantly overlap. in addition, in the process of assay design optimization, primers within a single tube may take on certain sequence characteristics that are intrinsically less likely to interact, and thus make higher-than-expected coverage possible for a given multiplexing target. multiplex pcr performance on human snp data next we implemented two multiplex pcr assay design algorithms and applied them to real snp data obtained from the dbsnp database. we prescreened the chromosome snps contained in build of dbsnp for class snps containing at least bases of non-low-complexity sequence both upstream and downstream from the target snp. this reduced our working set to snps, % of the original total, from which snps were randomly selected for experimental purposes. the gc content of the 401-base flanking sequence surrounding was % +/- % in line with a 41% gc content for chromosome and for the human genome as a whole. our two best-fit greedy algorithms are designed to simultaneously assign primer candidates to snps and to partition snps into individual tubes in an effort to maximize both multiplexing level and coverage. see methods for complete details. while best fit algorithms are relatively simple, one can actually show theoretically that these results appear to be as good as expected in graphs with this level of density. one version which we call ""fixed-assignment best fit"" assigns snps in random order to the fullest compatible tube, and as the name suggests, once a snp is assigned to a tube it is fixed. neither its assigned tube nor its associated primers are ever modified. if no compatible tube can be found, the snp is left unassigned, reducing total coverage. we considered a second variation on the best-fit approach called ""flexible assignment best fit"" in which snps already assigned to a tube can be removed under special conditions in order to accommodate a new snp assignment. special rules of the algorithm guarantee that the algorithm will eventually terminate with increasingly high probability. figure demonstrates the precise nature of the tradeoff between multiplexing and snp coverage for a fixed number of snps for both best fit methods. multiplex pcr coverage performance tradeoffs next we employed the fixed-assignment best-fit algorithm to generate coverage curves for target multiplexing levels m = while varying numbers of snps. we considered snp sets containing between and snps. figure presents our results. with snps, 80% coverage could be achieved with 10-plex assays, but this drops to 40% coverage using 20-plex assays. however, if we increase the number of snps to then for 20-plex assays, coverage increases from approximately 40% to 80%. this graph shows that regardless of the multiplexing level desired, coverage increases with the number of snps but with diminishing returns. more precisely, for fixed multiplexing level m, coverage is roughly proportional to log. discussion there is extensive literature on the general principles of pcr primer design. this work has led to a number of software applications, most notably primer and various extensions. a fast dynamic programming formulation for testing primers for pair-wise compatibility has also been developed. the application of multiplex pcr has increased steadily over the past decade, requiring more sophisticated primer selection protocols. different algorithms may favor particular objectives, or may be designed for particular technology platforms. in general, the problem of identifying primer pairs to maximize the multiplexing level of a single assay has been shown to be np-complete by nicodeme and steyaert who also present an approximation algorithm that eliminates 3' base complementarity while addressing product size constraints. they also consider electrophoresis distance constraints that require two amplicons to have some minimum length difference so that they can be distinguished after being processed through an electrophoresis gel. additionally, snp detection methods based on primer extension protocols in conjunction with mass spectrometry must take into account the resolution of the mass spectrometer as for example with the matching algorithms presented by aumann, manisterski, and yakhini. whereas this paper focuses on the dual problem of assigning primers and partitioning snps into multiplex-compatible tubes, an entirely different multiplex pcr problem is concerned with finding a minimal number of primers necessary to amplify a maximum number of targets over a single experiment or over multiple experiments. our best fit approach is motivated by the theoretical analysis provided by alon and furedi who show that a greedy algorithm in standard graphs produces an independent set of size log n, and moreover this approach can be extended to produce a full cover of the graph. the multi-node graph is, in practice, substantially more complex to cover, however theoretical analysis suggests that the behavior is similar to standard graphs. the sketch of the proof is as follows. formal details are provided elsewhere. for a multi-node graph with n nodes and s states per node, we create a corresponding standard graph with ns nodes. we add random edges with probability p getting o edges. then we remove all the edges between nodes that are connecting representatives of the same node. the total number of edges removed is n s p. this means independently of the number s of representatives per node we remove roughly 1/n of the total number of edges. if 1/n << p then this removal does not greatly effect the resulting graph and the probability that their exists a clique of size k on a graph of size ns applies to a multi-node graph of size n with s representatives per node.  in this paper, we quantified some of the critical tradeoffs involved in the multi-objective design of multiplex pcr assays and demonstrated a phase transition suggesting that achieving high-coverage designs becomes dramatically more difficult when snp compatibility probabilities fall below a certain critical threshold. explicit consideration of tradeoffs in multiplex pcr design is useful in helping researchers to design effective and reliable assays within the computational limits of the problem. furthermore, such tradeoffs provide a natural basis for comparing and contrasting novel computational techniques aimed at improving one or more objectives. although we have attempted to rely on standard design criteria, further laboratory testing is required to validate the design criteria used as the basis of this analysis. in the future we will seek to further improve our current tradeoff benchmarks with the development of novel algorithms and to apply our techniques to the design of high-multiplexing assays that achieve broad coverage of the complete human genome. we have also developed a web-enabled multiplex pcr assay design system known as muplex that also serves as a testing ground for on-going algorithmic development. "," multiplex pcr is a key technology for detecting infectious microorganisms, whole-genome sequencing, forensic analysis, and for enabling flexible yet low-cost genotyping. however, the design of a multiplex pcr assays requires the consideration of multiple competing objectives and physical constraints, and extensive computational analysis must be performed in order to identify the possible formation of primer-dimers that can negatively impact product yield.  this paper examines the computational design limits of multiplex pcr in the context of snp genotyping and examines tradeoffs associated with several key design factors including multiplexing level, coverage, and tube-size uniformity. we also examine how design performance depends on the total number of available snps from which to choose, and primer stringency criterial. we show that finding high-multiplexing/high-coverage designs is subject to a computational phase transition, becoming dramatically more difficult when the probability of primer pair interaction exceeds a critical threshold. the precise location of this critical transition point depends on the number of available snps and the level of multiplexing required. we also demonstrate how coverage performance is impacted by the number of available snps, primer selection criteria, and target multiplexing levels.  the presence of a phase transition suggests limits to scaling multiplex pcr performance for high-throughput genomics applications. achieving broad snp coverage rapidly transitions from being very easy to very hard as the target multiplexing level increases. the onset of a phase transition can be ""delayed"" by having a larger pool of snps, or loosening primer selection constraints so as to increase the number of candidate primer pairs per snp, though the latter may produce other adverse effects. the resulting design performance tradeoffs define a benchmark that can serve as the basis for comparing competing multiplex pcr design optimization algorithms and can also provide general rules-of-thumb to experimentalists seeking to understand the performance limits of standard multiplex pcr.

93," the adenomatous polyposis coli protein is an important tumour suppressor in the colonic epithelium. a key function of this highly conserved protein is to antagonize wnt signalling, by constitutively downregulating the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/armadillo, a key effector of the wnt signalling pathway. loss of this function is thought to be critical in the initiation of colorectal tumorigenesis as it causes a transcriptional switch in the intestinal epithelium towards actively dividing crypt progenitor cells. apc proteins are highly conserved among vertebrates and flies, and flies encode two apc proteins with overlapping roles in wnt signalling during development. however, apc proteins have additional functions in connection with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that appear to be separate from their function in controlling wnt signalling. one of these functions is a role of apc in facilitating cellular adhesion, as indicated by studies in drosophila tissues and in mammalian colorectal cancer cells. this function in cellular adhesion is likely to be conferred by the subcellular pool of apc protein that is associated with adherens junctions in drosophila and in polarised mammalian cells. the mechanism by which apc facilitates cellular adhesion is unknown. in order to explore this mechanism, we asked whether drosophila e-apc might have a structural role at ajs. if so, e-apc would be expected to be stably associated with ajs, similarly to the structural components of the adhesive complex. as in mammalian epithelia, the main functional components of this complex in drosophila are the transmembrane protein e-cadherin, a calcium-dependent trans-membrane adhesion molecule, and the catenins that link e-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton at the cytoplasmic side. we thus conducted photobleaching experiments on live embryos expressing e-apc or structural aj components tagged with green fluorescent protein, to compare their relative mobility. these experiments revealed that gfp-e-apc is less stably associated with ajs than their structural components. we also found that gfp-e-apc is remarkably mobile in neurons.  we used the gal system to express gfp-e-apc throughout the embryo, and found that its subcellular distribution is very similar to that of endogenous e-apc in fixed embryos. in particular, gfp-e-apc is concentrated underneath the plasma membrane in apicolateral regions of embryonic epithelial cells. these regions form the zonula adherens which contains the ajs; they can also be visualised with antibody staining against α-catenin, and we observe a remarkably close coincidence of gfp-e-apc and α-catenin. similar results were obtained by akong at el. who examined the same gfp-e-apc transgene in the embryo, and who also showed that gfp-e-apc is distributed similarly as endogenous e-apc in larval neuroblasts. next, we conducted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments in live embryos, to examine how stably gfp-e-apc is associated with adherens junctions. we bleached the fluorescence in a defined square centred over the junctional region of an epithelial cell with a short laser pulse, and examined the recovery of the fluorescence within this square over time. this revealed a relatively fast rate of recovery of most of the fluorescence within a few minutes. quantitative analysis shows that nearly 80% of the initial fluorescence is recovered within ~ seconds. this indicates that the association of e-apc with the za is dynamic rather than stable. the fluorescence recovery observed in these frap experiments could be due to movement of e-apc between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, but also to sideways movement along the plasma membrane. we also conducted frap experiments with structural aj components, namely e-cadherin-gfp, armadillo-gfp and α-catenin-gfp. in these cases, we can only recover a small fraction of the initial fluorescence within the time frame of the experiment. furthermore, the rate of recovery is slower than that observed with gfp-e-apc, with estimated half-times of > minutes. this also appears to be true for armadillo-gfp, though we cannot estimate its half-time of recovery with confidence, given that its fluorescence levels are considerably lower than that of the other gfp-tagged protein examined in this study. we conclude that e-apc is significantly more mobile than the structural aj components. this suggests that e-apc shuttles either within the cortex, along the zonula adherens, or that it shuttles from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. interestingly, the observed rates of recovery of gfp-e-apc were much slower than the estimated rate of free diffusion. this suggests that the movements of gfp-e-apc are primarily determined by the kinetics of its binding to ligands. one of these could be axin which associates with e-apc in drosophila cells to from large dot-like structures. similarly, axin associates with apc in mammalian cells to form large molecular weight protein complexes. our observations argue against a structural role of e-apc in cellular adhesion. however, they are consistent with a catalytic role of e-apc in facilitating cellular adhesion, for example by maintaining the junctional pool of armadillo. in support of this, recent evidence suggests that there is rapid exchange of β-catenin within the junctional cadherin complex, and that apc is required for this process. in late embryonic stages, gfp-e-apc forms striking patches underneath the apical plasma membrane of epidermal cells that are in the process of forming denticle extrusions. these striking'pre-denticle' patches are also seen in embryos stained with antibody against e-apc, and overlap with actin patches. they may thus represent an actin-dependent association of e-apc as that seen in the cortex of earlier epithelial cells and at the ring canals between nurse cells within the egg chambers. frap experiments revealed that the presence of gfp-e-apc in these pre-denticle patches is also dynamic, with an estimated half-time of fluorescence recovery of 200– seconds. again, e-apc is therefore unlikely to have a structural role in these patches. it has been reported that e-apc and armadillo are required for anchoring mitotic spindles in the cortex of dividing blastoderm cells in the early drosophila embryo. we cannot measure the kinetics of gfp-e-apc association with the cortex in these early embryonic cells, because of insufficient expression levels at this stage. however, assuming that these kinetics do not change radically during embryonic development, our observations from the later embryos suggest that e-apc has a catalytic role in capturing microtubules in the cellular cortex, rather than providing a structural tether. we also expressed gfp-e-apc in eye imaginal discs, to examine its subcellular distribution within a larval epithelial sheet. we thus noticed striking puncta of green fluorescence within the axons of the optic stalk that connects these discs to the larval brain. these puncta resemble the e-apc/axin-gfp dots that we observe in embryonic cells and in these axons, and also the e-apc/armadillo dots that peifer and colleagues observed in early embryos. they may thus represent the axin destruction complex. we performed frap experiments, bleaching a μm wide strip perpendicularly across the axons and monitoring the recovery of the fluorescence into the bleached section. this revealed that the gfp-e-apc puncta are remarkably dynamic: they re-appear within the bleached area within a minute, with an estimated half-time of ~ seconds. many of these puncta seem to re-appear from other focal planes, so we cannot be absolutely certain that they represent movement of existing puncta. however, some of the puncta re-appearing in the bleached area can clearly be traced as moving puncta within the same focal plane. the movement of these gfp-e-apc puncta may be due to tracking, although we cannot see uni-directionality of movement. the movement we observe in these axons is somewhat reminiscent of that observed with a gfp-tagged truncation of xenopus apc that misses its c-terminus: this truncation, despite lacking the putative microtubule-interacting domain within its c-terminus, forms large puncta that can track along microtubules in xenopus tissue culture cells. gsk is inhibited during wnt signalling, and gsk mutants in drosophila therefore mimic constitutive and sustained wingless signalling. the normal level of wingless signalling in the embryonic epidermis does not appear to change the subcellular distribution of bulk e-apc protein, although it does cause a re-location of axin-gfp/e-apc complexes to the plasma membrane. however, a reduction of cortical e-apc has been observed in early sgg mutant embryos. likewise, in older sgg mutant embryos, the levels of membrane-associated gfp-e-apc are also noticeably reduced. however, this does not appear to be due to a change in mobility of gfp-e-apc since the kinetics of fluorescence recovery between wild-type and sgg null mutant embryos were comparable. instead, it is due to a reduction of the overall e-apc protein levels in these mutants: western blot analysis of 2– hour old embryos revealed that the total levels of gfp-e-apc protein were much lower in sgg mutant embryos compared to the wild type. the same is true for endogenous e-apc whose levels are also substantially reduced in sgg mutants. this indicates that sgg is required for the stability of e-apc protein, and it suggests that sustained wingless signalling may destabilise e-apc. similarly, phosphorylation by gsk is required for the stability of mammalian axin, a functional binding partner of apc, and the levels of drosophila axin in embryos are also reduced after prolonged wingless signalling. destabilisation of the main components of the axin complex during wnt signalling may be a positive feedback mechanism resulting in the amplification of the signalling level. the subcellular distribution of e-apc and its accumulation at the adherens junctions is unchanged in other mutants of the wingless signalling pathway. we thus did not expect any of these mutants to affect the shuttling behaviour of gfp-e-apc to and from the plasma membrane. in support of this, preliminary frap experiments indicated that the kinetics of fluorescence recovery are unaffected in dsh null mutant embryos. taken together with our results from the sgg mutants, this suggests that the kinetic association of gfp-e-apc with the plasma membrane is unaffected by wingless signalling.  our frap experiments provided evidence that e-apc is a cytoplasmic shuttling protein whose association with the adherens junctions is highly dynamic. the speed of its shuttling to and from the plasma membrane appears to be constitutive and does not require gsk activity. the dynamic association of e-apc with the plasma membrane is consistent with a catalytic role of e-apc, and argues against a structural or tethering role in the cell cortex. "," the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor is found in multiple discrete subcellular locations, which may reflect sites of distinct functions. in drosophila epithelial cells, the predominant apc relative is concentrated at the apicolateral adherens junctions. genetic analysis indicates that this junctional association is critical for the function of e-apc in wnt signalling and in cellular adhesion. here, we ask whether the junctional association of e-apc is stable, or whether e-apc shuttles between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.  we generated a drosophila strain that expresses e-apc tagged with green fluorescent protein and we analysed its junctional association with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments in live embryos. this revealed that the junctional association of gfp-e-apc in epithelial cells is highly dynamic, and is far less stable than that of the structural components of the adherens junctions, e-cadherin, α-catenin and armadillo. the shuttling of gfp-e-apc to and from the plasma membrane is unaltered in mutants of drosophila glycogen synthase kinase, which mimic constitutive wingless signalling. however, the stability of e-apc is greatly reduced in these mutants, explaining their apparent delocalisation from the plasma membrane as previously observed. finally, we show that gfp-e-apc forms dynamic patches at the apical plasma membrane of late embryonic epidermal cells that form denticles, and that it shuttles up and down the axons of the optic lobe.  we conclude that e-apc is a highly mobile protein that shuttles constitutively between distinct subcellular locations.

94," the most widely used strategies to investigate the function of genes in medaka are the analyses of mutants, miss-expression of wild type genes or their variants by mrna injection and gene specific translational inhibition by morpholino injections. however, the phenotype of a given mutation mainly reflects the first temporal function of the affected gene in embryonic development, obscuring possible later functions. similarly, mrna and morpholinos exert their functions immediately following injection, providing information only on the early role of the gene of interest. a detailed analysis of gene function in a given process can thus be a difficult task. the gal4/uas system provides an alternative and more specific strategy to analyze specific functions of a gene. the direct application of the drosophila gal4-uas approach, by the generation of transgenic lines, has been established successfully in zebrafish. however, the generation of different transgenic activator and effector lines may be a time- and space-consuming task, and expression levels in these transgenic lines are weak, probably due to a limited transactivation potential of gal in fish. gal4/vp a fusion of the yeast gal dna-binding domain with the strong vp transactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus can be used to enhance transactivation efficacy. yet, strong transcriptional activators can cause unspecific promoter squelching resulting in retardation of embryogenesis. nonetheless, the gal4/vp16-uas system has been used in zebrafish in transient approaches resulting in mosaic, but easily detectable transgene expression. we have applied the gal4/vp16-uas system for transient transactivation in a heat-shock inducible transgenic gal4/vp activator line. generation of transgenic medaka lines, which allow the induction of the gal4/vp activator to'physiological' levels was achieved by using a 5' truncated version of the zebrafish heat-shock promoter hsp. using a heat-shock promoter to drive expression of the gal4/vp activator allows tight temporal control of activator and effector gene expression. to trace transgene expression in cells of living embryos we have used the cyan fluorescent and yellow fluorescent proteins. combination with the meganuclease transgenesis system and the direct-inverted repeats of the sleeping beauty transposon system yielded high numbers of transgene expressing cells. thus, in contrast to the entirely mosaic nature of a transient approach reported thus far, the combined use of a transgenic activator line with systems enhancing even dna distribution or early integration allows uniform expression of injected effector genes upon induction by heat-shock treatment without an immediate need to generate transgenic uas lines.  generation of a heat-shock inducible transgenic gal4/vp activator line dna injection leading to mosaic expression in g allows in vivo tracing of transgene-expressing cells and observation of effects exerted by the transgene through application of fluorescent markers. however, elucidation of biological questions sometimes requires ubiquitous expression of transgenes in a temporally controlled manner. while the mn protocol strongly reduces mosaicism, it does so only in a fraction of injected embryos. this can be improved by the use of transgenic animals providing inducible and sufficient expression in all cells. the idea is to combine stable heat-shock inducible expression of the gal4/vp activator with transient expression of effector genes upon microinjection. the effector constructs are uniformly distributed in the entire embryo due to the presence of the sb direct-inverted repeats. we have designed two activator/reporter vectors containing gal4/vp under control of a kb fragment of the zebrafish hsp promoter or a kb 5' truncated fragment of zfhsp respectively. both vectors contain cfp downstream of several uas elements as an internal reporter. the ir/drs of sb and two i-scei meganuclease sites flank this entire expression cassette. the internal reporter provides a direct read-out for activator expression. a third vector, containing yfp downstream of several uas elements and flanked by ir/drs, was designed as an independent reporter. it has been shown that the gal4/vp activator can interfere with general transcription by titrating the basal transcription machinery. we observed developmental retardation and malformation in all embryos injected with gal4/vp driven by ubiquitous promoters. similarly, co-injection of high concentrations of gal4/vp mrna with pcg wcs always resulted in developmental malformations. however, dna co-injections did not affect embryonic development in transient experiments when the hsp promoter was used to control gal4/vp expression. moreover, co-injections of low concentrations of gal4/vp mrna with the activator/reporter construct pcg wcs also showed no effects on embryogenesis, suggesting that the toxicity of the activator depends on the expression level. the truncated version of the zfhsp promoter fragment used in the activator/reporter construct pcg wcs showed a moderate activation upon heat-shock treatment. this allowed adjusting the induction levels by varying the heat-shock duration. a transgenic medaka line was established in which expression levels directly correlated with the heat-shock duration. extended heat-shocks resulted in very high expression levels, but also caused retardation phenotypes due to the strong transactivation potential of the gal4/vp fusion protein. comparable phenotypes were not observed in heat-shock treated wild type embryos. depending on the developmental stage at the time of induction, the duration of heat-shock treatment was adjusted to induce gal4/vp and reporter expression without interfering with embryonic development. induction periods ranged from one minute of heat-shock at 37°c at early stages to minutes at later stages. on top of uniform cfp expression in the entire embryo and yolk upon heat-shock, some regions of the embryo showed additional responsiveness of the reporter. microinjection experiments and rt-pcr revealed that reporter gene expression in transgenic fish is mediated by gal4/vp offspring of pcg -wcs/t transgenic fish was injected with gal4/vp mrna at the one-cell stage without heat-shock treatment. injected embryos exhibited uniform expression of cfp shortly after the onset of zygotic transcription at the mid-blastula transition, indicating that cfp expression was induced in response to gal4/vp. we applied rt-pcr for the dose/response analysis of activator and reporter mrna. transcripts of gal4/vp were detectable already minutes after a heat-shock of seconds at 37°c. following a steady increase until about three hours after induction, gal4/vp messages were degraded between five and ten hours to undetectable levels after twenty hours. cfp mrna was first detected after two hours and transcript levels were still increasing after h. this indicates that the transcription of the reporter cfp is controlled by gal4/vp protein and that active gal4/vp is still present when the amount of its transcripts already dropped below detectable levels. activation of an independent reporter upon injection into the transgenic activator line pcg wcs/t we tested the gal4/vp activator line pcg wcs/t as a tool to induce expression of an independent reporter upon injection of plasmid dna. transgenic embryos were injected with different concentrations of the reporter pcg y. injected embryos were subjected to heat-shock treatment at different developmental stages for various periods of time, kept at 28°c thereafter and monitored for activator and effector expression during the following days. due to the sb ir/drs flanking the expression cassette, the independent reporter was distributed equally in the entire embryo resulting in ubiquitous expression of yfp, entirely co-localizing with the internal reporter. additional mosaic clones of cells expressing yfp at higher levels presumably reflect higher plasmid concentrations in these cells. however, yfp expression levels appeared relatively independent from the dna concentration, but were directly correlated to the expression levels of the activator or internal reporter, respectively.  here we show that the gal4/vp16-uas transactivation system can be efficiently used in medaka. by using fluorescent proteins as internal or independent reporter, cells co-expressing the activator and the gene of interest can be visualized directly. transparency of these fish embryos allows the evaluation of the cellular fate and response to ectopically expressed genes by time-lapse analyses. the combination with inducible promoters permits temporal control of effector gene expression and enables the modulation of the response intensity by adjusting the duration of the heat-shock treatment. this inducible system can be used in transient experiments to study the behavior of transgene expressing cells in an otherwise wild type environment. the combination with the mn and sb system offers to tailor a range of different levels of mosaicism. a transgenic gal4/vp activator line was generated, which provides a powerful tool to induce activator and effector gene expression in a ubiquitous manner at a given time-point. when used in microinjection approaches of reporter vectors containing ir/drs, our transgenic activator line allows ubiquitous and uniform expression of the reporter gene without the need to generate transgenic effector lines. in addition to temporal control mediated by the heat-shock promoter, induction using a focused laser-beam could provide precise spatial control of the effector gene expression. "," genetic interference by dna, mrna or morpholino injection is a widely used approach to study gene function in developmental biology. however, the lack of temporal control over the activity of interfering molecules often hampers investigation of gene function required during later stages of embryogenesis. to elucidate the roles of genes during embryogenesis a precise temporal control of transgene expression levels in the developing organism is on demand.  we have generated a transgenic gal4/vp activator line that is heat-shock inducible, thereby providing a tool to drive the expression of specific effector genes via gal4/vp merging the gal4/vp16-uas system with the i-scei meganuclease and the sleeping beauty transposon system allows inducible gene expression in an entirely uniform manner without the need to generate transgenic effector lines. combination of this system with fluorescent protein reporters furthermore facilitates the direct visualization of transgene expressing cells in live embryos.  the combinatorial properties of this expression system provide a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function during embryonic and larval development in fish by ectopic expression of gene products.

95," species differences in cortical regionalization reflect genetic and epigenetic developmental programs that are presumed adaptations to different ecological niches. for example, krubitzer and kahn review that the mouse, ghost bat, and short-tailed opossum have approximately the same size cortical sheet, but differ substantially in the size of one of three primary sensory cortical areas. the enlarged cortical area in each species reflects a greater behavioral reliance on the represented sensory modality. in the same sensory modality, functional specialization of the sensory periphery is also reflected in the primary cortical area size. catania and remple show that the naked mole-rat, a fossorial species dependent on somatosensation, has a much greater cortical surface area devoted to somatosensation compared to the laboratory rat. as discussed by krubitzer and kahn, although differences in genetic determination are well implicated by these species differences, identity of the genes and their developmental actions are not well understood. recent experimental manipulations in mice have caused striking qualitative and quantitative changes in the cortical area map, identifying several candidate morphogens that affect anteroposterior or mediolateral cortical regionalization as well as mitogenesis. for example, fukuchi-shimogori and grove placed an ectopic caudal source of fibroblast growth factor into the developing mouse cortex and caused a caudal duplication of part of the primary somatosensory area. hamasaki et al. demonstrated changes in the position and or size of primary sensory visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortical regions in transgenic mice over expressing the transcription factor emx these and other discoveries suggest that arealization of the mammalian cortical sheet develops in a manner consonant with principles established for embryonic patterning of the body. signaling centers release morphogens that determine regional growth and tissue identity by regulating regional expression of transcription factors. grove and fukuchi-shimogori note that such research has provided a starting point for investigating how the cortical area map is generated and modified in a single individual and how maps change in the course of evolution, but that a major step forward would be to identify novel transcription factors involved in cortical area patterning. along these lines, funatsu et al. have employed gene expression array analysis of the dissected embryonic mouse cerebral cortex to expand the list of genes regionally expressed, and noted that regional differences in expression of genes in the cortical plate should eventually convert into functionally distinct cortical areas with anatomically distinguishable borders after birth. inbred strains of laboratory mice can be exploited to study and understand complex traits of the nervous system if there is significant phenotypic variation with which to correlate gene polymorphism or expression data. as the first step to an integrative and relational discovery program in a model system for mammalian cortical area map formation, here we describe significant differences in the cortex of two common inbred strains of laboratory mice, c57bl/6j and dba/2j.  neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex differ between c57bl/6j and dba/2j using established histochemical methods to visualize neocortical and primary cortical areas, we estimate that neocortex is on average 7% larger in c57bl/6j compared to dba/2j. while both visual cortex and barrel cortex areas significantly correlate with total neocortex area, each also uniquely differs between strains. using ancova to control for variation in neocortex size, the adjusted mean visual cortex areas for c57bl/6j and dba/2j are and mm respectively, a 12% difference. using ancova, the neocortex adjusted mean barrel cortex areas for dba/2j and c57bl/6j are and mm respectively, a 10% difference. these results are shown graphically in figures and in figure the ancova plot shows that c57bl/6j mice have more visual cortex; the c57bl/6j linear fit is above the dba/2j linear fit. in figure the ancova plot shows that dba/2j mice have more barrel cortex; the dba/2j linear fit is now above the c57bl/6j linear fit, reversed from figure there is no significant evidence for heterogeneity of slopes in the fitted lines from figure or figure when interaction terms are added to the ancova models. cortical field size configuration predicts c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains given the significant differences in neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex areas between c57bl/6j and dba/2j, we can ask how well these measures collectively predict or discriminate strain identity. in a logistic regression model predicting strain identity from neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex areas, the overall model is significant =, p <; hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit χ =, p = ), as is neocortex area =, p = ), visual cortex area =, p = ), and barrel cortex area =, p < ). table shows the prediction table for this model, revealing out of mice were correctly classified by strain. figure and figure graphically portray these results. figure plots the predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model by strain. figure plots a projection from a three dimensional rotating plot for neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex. when rotated to the projection shown, a plane separates the strains with 90% accuracy. c57bl/6j and dba/2j strains are not differentiated on other dimensions neither the area of somatosensory cortex taken as a whole, nor auditory cortex area was found to be significantly different between strains. subjectively, we found the dorsal border of s and the borders of a to be more difficult to distinguish in our tissue than either v or pmbsf. neither s nor a area measures added significantly to the ability to predict strain identity. discussion grove and fukuchi-shimogori and krubitzer and kahn suggest that the cortical map, at least for primary areas, develops independently of thalamic input, by way of signaling centers releasing morphogens that determine areal identity. this is not a claim that thalamic projections to the cortex do not play a role in cortical area map formation, but rather that principles of development observed in body embryogenesis are also active in early cortical area map formation. developmental and genetic manipulations have produced striking evidence for a handful of candidate morphogens in cortical area map formation. recent gene array expression studies are expanding the list of genes that may act to pattern the mammalian cortex. to date, there is little evidence these candidate morphogens cause individual or species differences. an approach that ties candidate or novel morphogens to cortical area map development and anatomy within the range of normal individual differences would prove complementary. complex trait analysis of the mouse central nervous system, allied with gene expression approaches, can be used with recombinant inbred strains of mice to provide a cumulative, integrative discovery program that has the potential to tie genomic and transcriptomic variation to variation of the central nervous system and the behaving organism. here we provide evidence that the cortical area map differs significantly even in two inbred strains of laboratory mice, c57bl/6j and dba/2j. importantly, these are the parental strains of the bxd recombinant inbred strains, and this study thus provides an empirical basis for using this mammalian neurogenetic resource to study cortical development. in this paper we have shown that neocortex, visual cortex, and barrel cortex differ in area between c57bl/6j and dba/2j inbred strains of mice, and that collectively, these measures accurately discriminate these strains. the relatively greater barrel cortex representation in dba/2j confirms an earlier abstract reporting greater representation of the barrel field in dba/2j compared to c57bl/6j mice. the larger neocortex in c57bl/6j is consistent with the larger brain size in this strain. the dimension of area is one way to measure the cortical map. other experimental studies have shown changes in field duplication, number, or position. in future studies of either bxd recombinant inbred lines, or of other commercial inbred strains or their derivatives, we suggest that more powerful statistical descriptions of the size and shape of the cortical area map could be used. borrowing from advances in the field of geometric morphometrics, methods that have been applied to the genetic architecture of the drosophila wing shape, or mouse mandible shape, could be applied to the mouse cortical area map, with landmarks defined by classical histochemical or immunohistological stains or by other molecular markers. landmark-based shape statistics are not a panacea for the measurement of biological form, but the point with regard to using isogenic strains is that landmarks can be investigated by replicate measures for reliability and can be correlated with genomic data, or transcriptomic data, at a particular developmental milestone, or across milestones. this is a promising research direction that would complement efforts to answer how the cortex develops, what are the functional or dysfunctional consequences for a particular cortical configuration, and even how the cortex has evolved or can evolve.  inbred strains of laboratory mice can be used to investigate mammalian cortical area map formation if there is significant phenotypic variation with which to correlate gene polymorphism or expression data. adult c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice are markedly different in cortical area maps, suggesting that inbred strains harbor enough phenotypic variation to encourage a forward genetic approach to understanding cortical development, complementing other approaches. "," recent discoveries suggest that arealization of the mammalian cortical sheet develops in a manner consonant with principles established for embryonic patterning of the body. signaling centers release morphogens that determine regional growth and tissue identity by regulating regional expression of transcription factors. research on mouse cortex has identified several candidate morphogens that affect anteroposterior or mediolateral cortical regionalization as well as mitogenesis. inbred strains of laboratory mice can be exploited to study cortical area map formation if there are significant phenotypic differences with which to correlate gene polymorphism or expression data. here we describe differences in the cortical area map of two commonly used inbred strains of laboratory mice, c57bl/6j and dba/2j. complete cortical hemispheres from adult mice were dissected and stained for the cytochrome oxidase enzyme in order to measure histochemically defined cortical areas.  c57bl/6j has the larger neocortex, relatively larger primary visual cortex, but relatively smaller posterior medial barrel subfield of the primary somatosensory cortex. the sample of c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice can be discriminated with 90% accuracy on the basis of these three size dimensions.  c57bl/6j and dba/2j have markedly different cortical area maps, suggesting that inbred strains harbor enough phenotypic variation to encourage a forward genetic approach to understanding cortical development, complementing other approaches.

96," thiamine is an essential compound for all known life forms. the well-known cofactor thiamine diphosphate is the major form of thiamine in most cell types. thiamine monophosphate and free thiamine, which have no known physiological function, account for only a few percent of the total thiamine content. thiamine triphosphate is generally a minor component but it has been found in most organisms, from prokaryotes to mammals. in vertebrates, thtp has been found to activate a large conductance anion channel and to phosphorylate certain proteins, suggesting that it may be involved in a new cellular signaling pathway. in animal tissues, cellular concentrations of thtp generally remain relatively constant and low. in contrast, in the enterobacterium e. coli, thtp content strongly depends on environmental conditions. thtp is nearly undetectable in rich lb medium, but in minimal medium devoid of amino acids, the addition of a carbon source such as glucose or pyruvate induces a rapid accumulation of thtp and its intracellular concentration may transiently exceed μm. overexpression in e. coli of a specific soluble mammalian thiamine triphosphatase, that we previously characterized, prevented thtp accumulation and induced the appearance of an intermediate plateau in bacterial growth. this suggested that thtp may be required for the rapid adaptation of bacteria to amino acid starvation. on the other hand, when the bacteria were incubated in minimal medium devoid of any carbon source, we noticed the appearance of a new compound that was identified as adenosine thiamine triphosphate. interestingly, thtp and athtp never accumulate simultaneously in high amounts, suggesting that the two compounds may act as specific alarmones, responding to different conditions of cellular stress. while athtp is synthesized according to the recently established reaction thdp + adp ⇔ athtp + pi, the enzymatic mechanism of thtp synthesis remains unclear. it has been shown that vertebrate adenylate kinase catalyzes the synthesis of thtp at a low rate according to the reaction thdp + adp ⇔ thtp + amp. although, the in vivo synthesis of thtp by ak was shown to occur in chicken skeletal muscle, we have found that ak knockout mice have normal thtp levels. this suggests that thtp synthesis by ak is not of physiological relevance in mammals, which does not rule out that other mammalian ak isoforms may be responsible for thtp synthesis. here we show that two bacterial aks are able to catalyze thtp synthesis at a low rate but our data strongly suggest that this enzyme is not responsible for the in vivo accumulation of thtp in e. coli in response to amino acid starvation.  we have previously reported that when e. coli cells are transferred to a minimal medium containing glucose, they accumulate thtp at a high rate. as ak is a possible candidate for catalyzing thtp synthesis, it is important to determine whether bacterial aks are able to catalyze this reaction and, if they do, to know whether the specific activity of, in particular, e. coli ak is sufficient to account for the relatively high rate of thtp production measured in vivo in this organism. we first tested the ability of commercially available ak from b. stearothermophilus to synthesize thtp from thdp and adp. the enzyme was indeed able to catalyze this reaction at a rate of pmol thtp formed per min per mg protein under our assay conditions. for the physiological reaction adp ⇔ atp + amp, we found μmol min- mg- thus, thtp synthesis by this enzyme is times slower than atp synthesis. thtp synthesis was measured at ph, except when indicated, as described in the methods section. the assays for atp synthesis were done at ph. a, this study; b,; c, e. coli has only one ak isoform. we overexpressed this protein in e. coli bl λde under the control of the lac operon. as shown in fig. 1a, the transformed bacteria produced high amounts of ak after induction by iptg. at the same time, the atp-synthesizing activity of e. coli ak was increased about 1000-fold in cell-free extracts. we also observed that these bacteria began to accumulate thtp shortly after addition of iptg, suggesting that thtp synthesis is a direct consequence of ak overexpression. after hours, the / ratio reached a relatively high value around. however, it is important to emphasize that in contrast to the normal bl strain, which accumulates thtp only in the presence of glucose in amino acid-depleted medium, e. coli overexpressing ak accumulated thtp in rich lb medium and glucose was not required. furthermore, iptg did not induce thtp synthesis in control bacteria carrying an empty plasmid. these results suggest that e. coli ak constitutively synthesizes thtp and that there is no physiological control of this reaction. the present results are very similar to those of shioda et al. who overexpressed chicken ak in e. coli and also observed an important accumulation of thtp after induction by iptg in rich lb medium. we measured the thtp-synthesizing activity of the overexpressed bacterial ak in vitro, in the supernatant obtained after sonication and centrifugation of the bacteria. under our assay conditions the rate was pmol min- mg- while the rate of atp synthesis was μmol min- mg- thus, thtp synthesis catalyzed by e. coli ak is over orders of magnitude slower than atp synthesis. a similar ratio between thtp and atp synthesis was also previously reported for porcine and chicken ak and for b. stearothermophilus ak. we conclude that the three types of ak investigated are able to catalyze thtp synthesis from thdp and adp, but the reaction is over times slower than atp synthesis. it is thus possible that the catalysis of thtp synthesis is a general property of aks, but this reaction is not likely to be of physiological importance. it is interesting to compare the rate of thtp synthesis by aks in vitro with the maximum rate observed in vivo. the latter is about pmol min- mg- for normal bl bacteria in minimal medium containing mm glucose. in cell-free extracts from bl bacteria, we found that the specific activity for ak-catalyzed atp synthesis was nmol min- mg- assuming that the rate of thtp synthesis is times lower, it would be about – pmol min- mg- two orders of magnitude lower than the accumulation measured in vivo. but after induction by iptg, ak expression is increased about 1000-fold, largely enough to account for the observed thtp accumulation. however, the thtp-forming activity of bacterial ak appears to be constitutive and to escape physiological control. nevertheless, it could still be argued that bacterial ak is responsible for thtp synthesis in vivo if one assumes that the enzyme can be activated by some unknown factor. the following experiment strongly suggests that a different, ak-independent mechanism is responsible for thtp synthesis in e. coli. we used the cv strain containing a heat-sensitive ak. cv e. coli grow normally at the permissive temperature but shifting them to 37°c leads to a rapid inactivation of ak and the subsequent drop in energy charge, causing a progressive decrease in the number of viable cells. as shown in fig. 2a, cv bacteria grown at 25°c respond normally by producing thtp when they are transferred to minimal medium containing glucose. however, high thtp levels were maintained for at least hours, while in bl bacteria incubated at 37°c, thtp accumulation was transient. when the cv bacteria were shifted to 37°c, they lost all detectable ak activity after less than hours as previously reported. however, addition of glucose under these conditions led to an unexpectedly high production of thtp. as shown in fig. 2b, the cellular thtp content after hours even exceeded thdp content while the total amount of phosphorylated thiamine, i.e. +, remained roughly constant. these results show that high amounts of thtp can be synthesized from thdp in the absence of ak activity. the phosphate donor is therefore unlikely to be adp. another obvious candidate is atp. however, when we incubate cv bacteria at 37°c we find that, even in the presence of glucose, the cellular atp concentration is less than 10% of the one found in normal bl bacteria or cv bacteria at 25°c as previously observed. this is not in favor of the hypothesis that atp is the phosphate donor except if the putative thdp kinase catalyzing this reaction has a very high affinity for atp. actually, there is so far no evidence that e. coli contains a thdp kinase. in cell-free bacterial extracts, we attempted to measure thtp formation from thdp and atp under various conditions but we were unable to detect any net synthesis of thtp. it thus appears that the phosphate donor for thdp phosphorylation may be neither adp nor atp, at least in e. coli. in eukaryotic organisms, it has long been thought that thtp is synthesized by a soluble thdp kinase: this enzyme was supposed to exist in mammals and in yeast. the enzyme was obtained in pure form from yeast but, like other preparations of thdp kinase, it had a very low specific activity. moreover, it is not certain that the reaction product was authentic thtp. indeed, it could well be that the compound synthesized was in fact athtp which can be synthesized from thdp and atp or adp by a soluble enzyme complex. thus, there is no conclusive evidence that thtp can be synthesized from thdp + atp, either in animals or in microorganisms. also, it is probable that in skeletal muscle where ak activity is very high, the latter may contribute to a significant synthesis of cytosolic thtp, especially in those species where soluble thtpase activity is absent such as in electric organ, chicken and pig skeletal muscle. indeed, electric organs and bird tissues contain no soluble thtpase and pig tissues express a catalytically inefficient thtpase.  in conclusion, the present results show that, in the heat-sensitive cv strain as in normal e. coli, thtp accumulation occurs through an adenylate kinase-independent mechanism. the bacteria produce thtp when they are transferred to minimal medium devoid of amino acids but containing glucose. the requirement for glucose does not appear to be related to its ability to generate atp. indeed, we find the highest accumulation of thtp in cv cells at 37°c when the energy charge is very low. it is remarkable that under such stressful conditions, the cells still devote a large part of their thdp and a significant amount of free energy to produce thtp. at present, we cannot exclude that thtp and possibly athtp are inactive storage forms of thdp. this hypothesis is however not very plausible as thtp and athtp accumulate under different and often opposing metabolic conditions. this would imply that thdp could be stored under a different form dependent on the kind of stress involved. therefore, it is more appealing to imagine that both compounds are some kind of alarmones or signalling molecules produced in response to different conditions of cellular stress. "," thiamine triphosphate exists in most organisms and might play a role in cellular stress responses. in e. coli, thtp is accumulated in response to amino acid starvation but the mechanism of its synthesis is still a matter of controversy. it has been suggested that thtp is synthesized by an atp-dependent specific thiamine diphosphate kinase. however, it is also known that vertebrate adenylate kinase catalyzes thtp synthesis at a very low rate and it has been postulated that this enzyme is responsible for thtp synthesis in vivo.  here we show that bacterial, as vertebrate adenylate kinases are able to catalyze thtp synthesis, but at a rate more than 106-fold lower than atp synthesis. this activity is too low to explain the high rate of thtp accumulation observed in e. coli during amino acid starvation. moreover, bacteria from the heat-sensitive cv strain accumulate high amounts of thtp at 37°c despite complete inactivation of adenylate kinase and a subsequent drop in cellular atp.  these results clearly demonstrate that adenylate kinase is not responsible for thtp synthesis in vivo. furthermore, they show that e. coli accumulate large amounts of thtp under severe energy stress when atp levels are very low, an observation not in favor of an atp-dependent mechanisms for thtp synthesis.

97," the non-recombining portion of haploid chromosome y is passed intact from father to son with a mutation rate several times greater than autosomes. as such, patterns of variation in y are widely used to uncover historical patterns of human migration; are important in genealogical reconstruction and have application in forensic analyses. the y chromosome consortium published a revised y-chromosome dna haplogroup tree in consisting of approximately markers which can be used to characterize major global haplogroups, labeled a-t, as well as sub-classification into a total of haplogroups at the finest level of resolution. different major haplogroups have been found at high frequencies in different geographical regions, for example the e clade in africa, and the o clade in eastern asia. particular fine-level haplogroups are found in multiple locations, such as r1a in eastern europe, south asia and central asia, indicating migration of r1a from eurasian steppes to the new world. the c haplogroup, found at high frequency throughout asia is commonly interpreted as genealogical remnants of the empire of genghis khan. y haplogroup assignment has traditionally been carried out by targeted genotyping using a combination of short tandem repeat typing, multiplex pcr and mini-sequencing, often using a hierarchical strategy in order to first refine the major haplogroup, and subsequently genotype markers within that haplogroup which illuminate finer levels of resolution. such a procedure requires substantial amount of wet-lab analysis, requires stringent replication and quality control to eliminate errors which can arise due to the limited amount of information collected at each step. more recently, personal genetic companies have included specific y chromosome markers on custom genotyping arrays. nevertheless, the resolution available from genotyping arrays is limited by markers included on the chip. high coverage high throughput sequencing has the potential to capture all single nucleotide and insertion/deletion variation, and as such provide near-perfect assignment of individuals to y haplogroups. one recently published method demonstrated the effectiveness of assigning y haplogroups with high coverage sequence data. as high coverage sequencing of large population samples remains expensive, low coverage population sequencing, in which each individual is sequenced at less than 2x haploid coverage is an attractive alternative, but this will not capture all individual-level variation. amy-tree, for example, found insufficient information in low coverage genomes from genomes project for confident haplogroup assignment. we hypothesize that, given the sharing of haplogroups within an ethnically homogenous population, it should be possible to borrow information across individuals within a population in order to improve haplogroup assignment. in this manuscript, we present the yhap tool, which has been designed for assigning haplogroups to low-coverage population re-sequencing data. yhap borrows information across all samples to assign samples to haplogroups probabilistically, thus providing an accurate representation of the inference which can be made from the data collected. yhap is a complete solution and can also be applied to high-coverage sequence data, as well as data from genotyping arrays. methods we use the set of haplogroups and mutations defined in. we map the forward and reverse primers described in this manuscript to identify the reported strand of the variation in the grch reference. after strand correction, we identify whether the mutant allele is the equal to the alternative or reference allele, so that we can subsequently work in reference/alternative allele space on the forward strand, consistent with conventional genotype calling schema. next, we map each mutation to its position on the pre-defined y phylogenetic tree t. finally we create a haplogroup matrix h of size nref*l where l is the total number of nodes in t and nref is the number of pre-defined y markers. each entry hil = {hilg} is a probability distribution vector expressing the probability that a sampled individual from the clade below node j carries allele g. at leaf nodes, this probability vector is either { } or { }, and at internal nodes, it is the proportion of descendant leaf nodes with reference or alternate alleles, respectively. to assign a sequenced individual to a specific haplogroup, we obtained genotype likelihoods at each putative variant site from chromosome y vcf files of the genome project. this results in a matrix g of size n*m where m is the number of sequenced samples, n is the number of putative variants, and gij = {gijg} is a vector of genotype likelihoods. we then generated an augmented h* matrix by adding in extra sites in g but not h with probability vector h*il = {, }. the pipeline is similar for genotype data, except that the genotype likelihoods are taken to be either if gi,j=g or otherwise. to illustrate the entries of this matrix, we have included a heatmap of both the standard y chromosome consortium positions which are polymorphic in the ceu, as well as the full h* matrix trained on ceu data. we can calculate the assignment of each individual using pg.j|h.l*=∏i=.n∑g= pgi,j|g*pg|hil* where pg|hil*=hilg* and pgij|g=gijg we can then calculate the posterior probability of each haplogroup amongst a set of haplogroups, where prior haplogroup probability distribution p is set to the uniform distribution, ph.l*|g.j=pg.j|h.l*ph.l*∑k=.lpg.j|h.k*ph.k* by restricting the set of haplogroups considered in equation, yhap can be customized to either only assign to within the major haplogroups, or all possible haplogroups at the finest level of classification. while this model is sufficient for assigning y haplogroups individually, it does not capture shared information between sequenced samples adequately, particularly for low coverage sequencing. given that a population sample will share individuals from the same haplogroup, and while none of these individuals may have enough depth at informative y haplogroup markers, there is enough information across the pooled reads from all samples from the same haplogroup. however, we do not know a-priori which samples can be pooled as coming from the same haplogroup. in order to pool information between samples, we treat the allele probability distribution {h*ilg} at markers present in the sequence data but not present as haplogroup markers, as parameters in our model. we update these parameters using expectation maximization, in which we first calculate the posterior probability assigning each sample j to each haplogroup l using equation and then update the {h*ilg} to reflect the average of genotypes assigned to haplogroup l at position i, weighted by this posterior probability of assignment. in this way, the model learns which alleles are characteristic of the pre-defined haplogroups, and is thus able to more accurately assign individuals which may not have good coverage at those sites, but which show similarity to other individuals across the y chromosome. the probabilities p are also updated at each step to reflect the proportion of haplogroups assigned in the population.  we applied yhap to low-coverage sequencing data generated in the pilot phase of the genome consortium which were also part of the hapmap project, including yri, jpt, ceu and chb samples. major y haplogroups have been previously assigned to these samples as part of the hapmap project. the average sequencing depth of these samples is x as described in genome y chromosome analysis report. compared to haplogroups previously obtained from the hapmap project, yhap showed perfect assignment accuracy. we also used yhap on the hapmap combined phase, y genotype data and obtained the same assignments previously reported with this data. 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 *e1b1a was formerly known as e3a. 1hapmap indicates results from hapmap consortium. 2ikg indicates results form genomes consortium. 3chip indicates results from yhap applied to hapmap genotype data. 4ngs indicates results from yhap applied to genomes consortium sequence data. the resolution reported for yhap is the level at which a single assignment achieved greater than 90% posterior probability. in order to investigate the ability of yhap to assign finer-level haplogroups we compared yhap results obtained at complete resolution on both hapmap genotype data and also genomes low coverage sequence data. we see that there is complete concordance at the major haplogroup level, and there is increasing uncertainty in assignment as the resolution of assignment increases, particularly using dense genotype data. we also observe that accuracy remains high amongst those assignments which yhap assigns high confidence. we compared yhap’s performance with amy-tree on the genome dataset. firstly we consider those genomes samples which were also assigned with amy-tree based on high coverage complete genomics data. yhap achieved greater resolution than amy-tree relative to this benchmark on of samples. in of samples yhap identified e1b1a haplogroup, whereas amy-hap assigned e1b1a using both genomes and complete genomics data, although in both cases yhap assigned the same haplogroup on the basis of hapmap genotype data. next, we use hapmap genotype data as a validation, using results on samples for which we have hapmap and genomes sequence data. yhap achieved greater resolution than amy-tree in of samples, whereas amy-tree never had greater resolution than yhap. as an example, this included yhap correctly identifying na as belonging to r1b1b haplogroup vs root for amy-tree amy-tree identified a haplogroup inconsistent with hapmap data in of samples, and yhap identified an inconsistent haplogroup in of samples. finally, in order to investigate the relationships between sequencing depth and assignment accuracy, we randomly downsampled the original bam files from genome to x. for simplicity, we chose jpt to run the test. we see that downsampling increases the uncertainty of assignment, but yhap accuracy remains high amongst those assignments which are made with high posterior probability. this demonstrates that as the underlying amount of information decreases, yhap is still able to extract inference and accurately represent the uncertainty of this inference. the total complexity for the whole procedure is o, conventionally, when using default settings, it will take almost 10 min to locate 10 ~  individuals and approximately 200 mb memory. discussion and  we have demonstrated the utility of using low-coverage population sequence data to accurately resolve y haplogroups at high resolution. this can be achieved via efficiently borrowing information between individuals in the population which have a common y haplogroup using a probabilistic assignment model. moreover, we have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately quantify the uncertainty in the haplogroup assignment, such that even for very low coverage sequence data it is possible to make inference of y haplogroups, but only achieve high certainty for a top-level haplogroup assignment. moreover, yhap can inform discovery

haplogroup analyses are an important component of genealogical reconstruction, population genetic analyses, medical genetics and forensics. these fields are increasingly moving towards use of low-coverage, high throughput sequencing. while there have been methods recently proposed for assignment of y haplogroups on the basis of high-coverage sequence data, assignment on the basis of low-coverage data remains challenging.  we developed a new algorithm, yhap, which uses an imputation framework to jointly predict y chromosome genotypes and assign y haplogroups using low coverage population sequence data. we use data from the genomes project to demonstrate that yhap provides accurate y haplogroup assignment with less than 2x coverage.  borrowing information across multiple samples within a population using an imputation framework enables accurate y haplogroup assignment.

98," mitochondrial genomes are physically separate from the nuclear genome. for animals, they are typically circular with a compact arrangement of an identical set of genes. for some animals, all genes are on the same strand, whereas for others they are divided between the two. the arrangement of these genes can remain stable for long periods of time; for example, human and shark mtdnas have the same gene arrangement, and do those of fruit fly and shrimp. however, in other lineages, rearrangements have occurred much more rapidly. many of the same processes that occur in large and complex nuclear genomes also take place in these diminutive genomes, so comparisons among mtdnas can address general questions of genome evolution, but in a model system that is much more tractable for a large number of taxa. toward this end, this article describes the complete mtdna sequence of the fat innkeeper worm, urechis caupo, the first example from the phylum echiura. echiurans comprise about species and are commonly called spoon worms because of the shape of their extensible proboscis. unlike annelids, they have no overt segmentation, but they develop via trochophore larvae, very similar to those of annelids. u. caupo is a pink, sausage shaped worm that lives in u-shaped burrows in the mud or sand of the intertidal or subtidal zones. unlike other echiurans, it feeds on plankton by filtering using an elaborate mucus net.  gene content and organization the mtdna of urechis caupo is nts in length and contains the same genes found for nearly all animal mtdnas. all genes are transcribed from the same strand, as is the case for the two studied annelid mtdnas, the polychaete platynereis dumerilii and the oligochaete lumbricus terrestris and for several other animal mtdnas. the arrangement of the genes is substantially similar to those of the two annelids, and shares short regions of similarity with several other mtdnas, as can be seen in table base composition and codon usage the u. caupo mtdna is 62% a+t, about the same as for annelid mtdnas. as is typical, all homodinucleotides and homotrinucleotides are greatly over represented relative to a random distribution and cg is the least frequent dinucleotide, both in absolute number and in the ratio of observed to expected. the gene-coding strand has a strong skew against g vs. c but about equal amounts of a vs. t; g-skew is – and t-skew is –. these values show no striking variation across the length of the mtdna. codon usage reflects these values, with those ending in a or t being most frequent. in all cases except for two, where they are synonymous, nnc codons are in greater abundance than nng codons, as is consistent with the coding strand being rich in c relative to g. the two exceptions are cgg and ggg codons, which are each in greater abundance than their respective synonyms, cgc and ggc. this invites the speculation that there is something favored about the gg dinucleotide created when g appears in the second codon position. however, this is not consistently seen, since in the remaining case, agc codons outnumber agg codons two-to-one. this effect has been shown to be very strong for codon usage pattern of the mtdna of the brachiopod terebratalia transversa. gene initiation and termination mitochondrial genes commonly use several alternatives to atg as start codons. however, of the proteins coding genes of u. caupo mtdna use atg. the only exceptions are cox which uses gtg and nad which uses atc. in the case of cox there is an in frame stop only three codons upstream and neither of the intervening codons is atg. also, this inference of starting on gtg specifies a set of amino acids well matched to those at the beginning of other cox proteins. the situation for nad is nearly identical, with an in frame stop only four codons upstream and no intervening atg codons. however, downstream of the inferred start are several ata codons that can not be ruled out as alternatives. the commonality of using atg as a start codon has also been noted for mitochondrial genes of four annelids, platynereis dumerilii, lumbricus terrestris, helobdella robusta and galathealinum brachiosum and a sipunculid, phascolopsis gouldii. a complete stop codon without overlap of the downstream gene is found for all except cox nad nad cob, and nad. in each of these cases, it appears that an abbreviated stop codon is generated by cleavage of a downstream trna from the polycistronic transcript, which is then completed to a taa stop codon by polyadenylation. however, in two of these cases, a complete stop codon could be formed by including only the next two nucleotides, and two other cases, there is an in frame stop codon just one or two codons downstream, respectively. it is not clear how gene overlaps could be resolved from a polycistronic transcript, but the presence of these stop codons seems beyond coincidence. it could be that they serve as a ""back up"" in case translation should begin in the absence of transcript cleavage. transfer rnas twenty-two regions can be folded into the typical cloverleaf structures of the expected set of trnas. there are several mismatched nucleotide pairs within stems; nearly all of these are flanked by multiple g-c pairs, suggesting that they may provide compensatory stability for these arms. t precedes the anticodon and a purine follows it for all trnas. the two serine trnas lack potential for folding a dhu arm, as has been found for a number of other animal mtdnas. there is an alternative folding possible for trna with a six-member anticodon stem and only one nucleotide separating the acceptor and dhu stems; this unusual folding has been found for the homologous genes of some mammals. trna also does not have potential for a normally paired dhu arm, although there are three potential nucleotide pairs if two nucleotides were between the dhu and anticodon stems. however, this potential pairing could, alternatively, be a coincidence, with the dhu arm having no paired stem for this trna. those with paired dhu arms have stems of three to five nucleotide pairs and loops of three to eight nts. all trnas have potential for stems of three to six nucleotide pairs for their tΨc arms with loops of three to seven nts. one of the trnas for serine has the anticodon tct; although this is often found, the alternative of gct is otherwise common. ribosomal rnas as has been the case for all studied animal mtdnas to date, two rrna genes are identified, one for each of the small and large mitochondrial ribosomal subunits. determining the precise ends of the rrna transcript requires experimentation, but if it's assumed that they extend to the boundaries of the adjacent genes, then rrns is nucleotides and rrnl is nucleotides in length. these genes are arranged sequentially, but without an intervening trna gene as is otherwise commonly found. non-coding regions the largest non-coding region is only nts long. the region is 71% a+t and contains one palindrome of an nt sequence, but otherwise no large repeat elements. obviously, this has potential for forming a stem-loop structure, and it may be significant that a short sequence a few nucleotides upstream, tcaaaa, has the potential for competing with this to form a short hairpin with the ttttga at the end of the palindrome. there has been previous speculation that regions with potential for competing, mutually exclusive hairpins may play a role in regulating transcription and/or replication. there are four other potential hairpins in this region with stems of 5– bp and loops of 5– nt. all four nucleotides occur in homopolymers with much greater frequency than expected by chance, often in runs of four or five. the second largest non-coding region is nt between trns and cox this has no repeat elements and the base composition is unremarkable. what role, if any, these sequences have in the regulation of transcription and/or replication awaits further study. aside from these and nt regions, there are only total intergenic nucleotides scattered among regions. in seven cases these are 2– nts long. for the other seven cases, genes are separated by a single nucleotide, and in six of these, that nucleotide is a c. the prevalence of c is consistent with the measured g-skew between the strands, although it is possible that this otherwise indicates some function of these nucleotides.  this is the first description of a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a representative of the phylum echiura. the genome contains the same genes most commonly found in animal mtdnas. many features are most similar to those found for annelid mtdnas, including a+t content, use of protein initiation codons, size and potential secondary structures of the largest non-coding region, and the relative arrangement of many genes. as in annelids examined to date, all genes are found on the same dna strand. as noted for brachiopod mtdna, there is a preference for g nucleotides to appear in tandem, without obvious explanation. further description and comparison of complete mtdna sequences will continue to produce a picture of genome evolution, particularly once sampling includes representatives of each animal phylum. "," mitochondria contain small genomes that are physically separate from those of nuclei. their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution. although hundreds of these genome sequences have been reported, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods, with many whole phyla remaining unstudied. this is the first description of a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a representative of the phylum echiura, that of the fat innkeeper worm, urechis caupo.  this mtdna is nts in length and 62% a+t. it contains the genes that are typical for animal mtdnas in an arrangement somewhat similar to that of annelid worms. all genes are encoded by the same dna strand which is rich in a and c relative to the opposite strand. codons ending with the dinucleotide gg are more frequent than would be expected from apparent mutational biases. the largest non-coding region is only nts long, is 71% a+t, and has potential for secondary structures.  urechis caupo mtdna shares many features with those of the few studied annelids, including the common usage of atg start codons, unusual among animal mtdnas, as well as gene arrangements, trna structures, and codon usage biases. mtdnaevolutiongene rearrangementannelidstrand skew ",fa772325-68e1-47d4-bad3-68e0482a782b,pubmed
99," dna sequence comparison is a well studied problem in biology and bioinformatics. recently, a new dna sequencing technology has been developed which does not measure each base directly, but instead measures dna bases in pairs in an encoded form. this technology has the potential to have greater error tolerance by differentiating biological variants from sequencing errors. in this manner, homer et al. previously developed an algorithm to compare an encoded dna sequence to a target reference, with a similar method independently derived in rumble et al.. these two algorithms do not significantly differ and therefore the proposed algorithm is compared to the algorithm presented in homer et al.. this two-base encoding and resulting local dna sequence comparison algorithm can be utilized with global search strategies for whole-genome sequencing with next-generation sequencing technology. the central advantage of the two-base encoding scheme is that the false discovery rate of a single nucleotide polymorphism is reduced, since two specific adjacent errors are required to produce a snp call. in fact, only one-fourth of all adjacent errors would result in a false call. this significantly reduces the probability of falsely observing a snp, with current machines exhibiting a color read error rate less than 5%. nevertheless, the currently implemented two-base encoding is not the only possible encoding. therefore a generalized k-base encoding scheme is presented, whereby k consecutive bases are simultaneously observed. the algorithm of homer et al. is extended to solve the dna sequence comparison problem of comparing a k-base encoded dna sequence and a target reference dna sequence. intuitively, with greater k, the number of errors required to falsely discover a snp also becomes greater, thus allowing machine errors to be accurately identified, and even corrected, while retaining sensitivity to detect real base changes. simulations are performed to explore the improved power of higher order k-base encoding schemes, as well as the performance time when utilizing these encodings. these simulations explore the case for adapting k-base encoding schemes in ligation-based next generation sequencing technology.  simulations were performed to explore the power and performance of k-base encoding as well as the k-base encoding local alignment algorithm. reads were simulated using sequences both with a uniform error-rate, as well as using sequences with an error-rate modeled after real-world data. in this discussion,""1-base encoding"" and ""no encoding"" are used interchangeably. the power to align a sequence with or without snps is defined as the fraction of reads where the read sequence is aligned to the reference with the same alignment score as if the sequence were aligned to the correct location. the fraction of reads where the read is aligned to call a snp, and where the original sequence had no snp, defines the false positive snp discovery rate. similarly, the fraction of reads where the read is aligned not to call a snp, and where the original sequence had a snp, defines the false negative snp discovery rate. plotted in figure is the power to align encoded sequences of varying length with 0- snps or base substitutions given a fixed uniform error rate for k =... the power decreases similarly for all read lengths as the error-rate increases given a fixed number of snps. furthermore, the power decreases substantially when the number of snps in the sequence is increased at a fixed error-rate and read length. the power of 1-base encoding, observing each base directly, does not diminish as much as k-base encoded sequences when more snps are introduced. this is due to snps and observational errors being equivalent in the 1-base encoding case. in these simulations, k-base encoding is more powerful when k > for snps, when k > for snp, and when k > for snps and longer read lengths. it is important to note that in many cases when the alignment score between the best alignment and correct alignment differ, the decoded base sequences match. therefore, the false positive and false negative snp discovery rates are examined later. to assess the power of k-base encoding utilizing real-world error rates, the color error rates were estimated from a previous run of an abi solid v sequencer. the power of aligning such sequences was assessed in the presence of 0- snps for k =... for sequences with no snps, the power of k-base encoding increases as k increases. however in the context of an increasing number of snps and for k > the power of k-base encoding is more ambiguous. for one snp, k = performs more poorly than no encoding, while k > improves on the lower width encodings. for two snps, both k = and k = perform more poorly than no encoding, with only k > having better power than no encoding. thus, error correction is increased with greater k when no snps are present. however, if the goal is to find variants, a large enough k must chosen carefully to justify the penalty in performance. power calculated as the fraction of reads that correctly align. simulated bp reads from the e. coli genome were generated with an estimated real-world error rate. the false positive snp discovery rate is evaluated for and base-pair reads. with no encoding, snps and errors are not distinguishable, and therefore k = is omitted from this discussion. as expected, the false positive snp discovery rate decreases as k increases. nevertheless, only above a five percent error rate does 2-base encoding begin to find false snps, and at approximately ten percent error rate do all encodings considered begin to falsely discover snps. assessed in figure is the false negative snp discovery rate. similarly to figure the false positive snp discovery rate, the false negative snp discovery rate decreases as k increases. for low error rates, both of the above metrics are either zero or are less than 20%. thus, the settings can be interpreted as being conservative, sacrificing power to find true snps for decreasing the false positive snp discovery rate. to illustrate the flexibility of k-base encoding to be tuned for specific scenarios, the power of base encoding is examined when the score for a color substitution is varied, and for and base-pair reads with - snps. intuitively, the various color substitution scores correspond to preferring a given number of color errors over a snp and possibly fewer color errors. as the color error score decreases, the encoding begins to prefer decoding with snps rather than with color errors. the various scoring schemes allow for a clear trade off in power to detect color errors over the power to detect snps. for example, the color substitution score of - allows the full correction of bp reads with up to a 20% error rate. however, once a snp is introduced it has zero power. alter-natively, the color substitution score of - finds snps in the low error case, but with higher error data the power to detect only the given snp is confounded as more snps are falsely detected. with zero snps, color scores of - - and - have almost perfect power. the performance time of k-base encoding scales exponentially with increasing k. this is confirmed by plotting the timing information from the previous uniform error-rate simulations. since the optimizations found in homer et al. are not pursued, increased variability was observed when the number of snps increased. however, an exponential increase in running time occurs as the encoding width increases. this has practical implications, whereby producing empirical data that is k-base encoded is possible, but is computationally infeasible to decode as the number of short-reads is in the millions, if not billions for typical experiments. performance time of k-base encoding assuming a real-word per-base error-ate on bp reads presented in table nevertheless, this exponential increase in running time could be significantly reduced at the cost of completeness by using methods initially adopted for protein similarity search and sequence comparison. a global search strategy is employed to put constraints on the possible search paths thereby significantly reducing the search space. typically these constraints force the alignment path to proceed along diagonals in the dynamic programming matrix, reducing the dimensionality of the problem. these constraints are specifically used in the implementation of bfast for both 1-base and 2-base encoded data. the positions where the read and reference match during the bfast's global search strategy are annotated and aggregated such that in the local alignment the read and reference must match. in bfast's case, the global search strategy searches over an 2-base encoded reference for k = constraining the color transitions. the constraints employed by bfast could be applied for k greater than two, yielding significant but unknown speed improvement.  the generalized k-base encoding scheme and resulting local alignment algorithm presented here have the ability to more powerfully differentiate between encoded sequencing errors and true dna variants. these schemes can be used in practice to tolerate high error rates in the raw data. alternatively, the per-base accuracy of sequencing can be improved. the goal in most sequencing projects is to sensitively and specifically detect variants. the technology and encoding scheme must not only have sufficient power to detect variants but to also not overwhelm the true variants with false variants. the results demonstrate that higher encoding schemes not only improve the power of detecting variants, but also significantly reduce the false positive snp discovery rate. having multiple observations of a specific variant or genomic co-ordinate is in most cases able to overcome sequencing error. nevertheless, these encoding schemes could allow low coverage data to accurately detect variants. furthermore, for cancer specific studies, where the sample may be a heterogeneous population of cells, these encodings could reduce the minimum detection level in the cancer cell population as the fewer observations can be more confidently trusted. currently a two-base encoding system is used by abi solid sequencing technology. some other next-generation sequencing technologies could also adopt an encoding system to improve their performance and accuracy. furthermore, algorithms that perform multiple sequence alignment or local reassembly could also utilize the power of the encoding scheme presented here. it is interesting to note that error correction utilizing encoded dna sequence could be performed if single bases or sets of bases were observed more than once. utilizing various encoding schemes, this error correction would necessarily not rely on a target dna reference comparison, thereby eliminating the expensive exponential increase in time for higher order encodings. future investigation of such pre-alignment error correction schemes and algorithms is intended. "," dna sequence comparison is a well-studied problem, in which two dna sequences are compared using a weighted edit distance. recent dna sequencing technologies however observe an encoded form of the sequence, rather than each dna base individually. the encoded dna sequence may contain technical errors, and therefore encoded sequencing errors must be incorporated when comparing an encoded dna sequence to a reference dna sequence.  although two-base encoding is currently used in practice, many other encoding schemes are possible, whereby two ore more bases are encoded at a time. a generalized k-base encoding scheme is presented, whereby feasible higher order encodings are better able to differentiate errors in the encoded sequence from true dna sequence variants. a generalized version of the previous two-base encoding dna sequence comparison algorithm is used to compare a k-base encoded sequence to a dna reference sequence. finally, simulations are performed to evaluate the power, the false positive and false negative snp discovery rates, and the performance time of k-base encoding compared to previous methods as well as to the standard dna sequence comparison algorithm.  the novel generalized k-base encoding scheme and resulting local alignment algorithm permits the development of higher fidelity ligation-based next generation sequencing technology. this bioinformatic solution affords greater robustness to errors, as well as lower false snp discovery rates, only at the cost of computational time.

100," despite being a long-standing target of scientific research, resolution of the phylogeny of the five living rhinoceroses using traditional approaches has been controversial. at the root of the problem is the placement of the sumatran rhinoceros, a species that has retained many ancestral morphological characters, among the broadly accepted sub-clades of the black and white rhinoceroses, and the javan and indian rhinoceroses. for example, on the one hand, the two horns of the sumatran rhinoceros suggest that it should be placed with the similarly two-horned black and white rhinoceroses, rather than with the single-horned javan and indian rhinoceroses. on the other hand, the geographic distribution of the sumatran rhinoceros, and its close proximity with the two other living asian species, would indicate that they form a natural clade. third, a hard trichotomy has been proposed, reflecting an effectively simultaneous divergence of the three lineages. attempts to resolve such questions can be made by including fossil taxa, for example the woolly rhinoceros in this case. however, this has proven to be similarly problematic. although it seems clear that the woolly and sumatran are closely related, the addition of morphological information from the woolly rhinoceros has failed to produce a convincing resolution of the relationships among the three pairs. in response to these problems, several dna-based studies have been undertaken on the rhinoceroses in an attempt to resolve the phylogeny. the first such study used restriction-digest mapping of mitochondrial dna ribosomal region to find weak support for the extant rhinoceros phylogeny as outlined on the basis of horn morphology. as larger amounts of data were incorporated into the analyses, however, this picture was modified – using complete 12s rrna and cytochrome b sequences, tougard et al. found high support for the phylogeny as outlined by geography. more recently, orlando et al. analysed ancient dna to confirm the monophyly of the woolly-sumatran rhinoceros pairing using complete 12s rrna and partial cytochrome b gene sequences. furthermore, in agreement with the work of tougard et al., their inferred phylogeny groups the woolly-sumatran pair with the javan-indian pair, but with <50% bootstrap support. thus the results of these later studies appeared to be an excellent illustration of the advantages of molecular sequence analysis over more traditional approaches, when resolving subtle phylogenetic questions. despite the successful results, however, one of the key lessons of the above is that even when using dna data, results can still be misleading without sufficiently large amounts of sequence. it has previously been advocated that phylogenies based on single genes can sometimes yield falsely supported results. the variation in phylogenetic signal among mitochondrial genes in elephantids provides a compelling illustration of this problem. in addition, cummings et al. analysed complete genomes and subsamples of them, concluding that small increases in sequence length will greatly increase the chance of finding the correct whole-genome tree when sequence lengths are below base-pairs. in light of this, the clearly controversial phylogeny of the rhinocerotidae, and the fact that previous studies have maximally been based on the bp of the combined 12s rrna and cytochrome b genes, we have revisited the molecular analysis using six complete mtdna genome sequences of the five extant, and extinct woolly, rhinoceroses. specifically, we have generated, using our previously published approach of utilising keratinous tissues as a high-quality source of mtdna for sequencing on the flx platform, four novel complete mitochondrial genomes. with the addition of the published mtdna genomes of the white and indian rhinoceroses, the six genomes cover all the living and one extinct member of the rhinocerotid family. we demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis of the complete mtdna genomes, as well as individual analyses of the constituent genes, questions the findings of the previous molecular reports.  mitochondrial genome sequences the four newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes are similar to the two previously published rhinoceros mitochondrial genomes, consisting of protein-coding genes, trna genes, two ribosomal rna genes, and a control region. the exact length is difficult to determine due to the presence of variable tandem repeats in the control; the consecutive repeats are longer than the read length of the roche flx, so we are unable characterise them. the sequences have been submitted to genbank with accession numbers fj, fj, fj and fj. an obvious power of complete mtdna genome sequencing is that it enables functional assessment and comparison of the genes between the taxa. mitochondrial protein-coding genes are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which is responsible for the production of up to 95% of the energy of eukaryotic cells, and modifications in these genes have been associated with the improvement of aerobic capacity and adaptation to new thermal environments. furthermore, mutations in mitochondrial genes have been implicated in exercise intolerance in humans. we have mapped the amino acid differences between the rhinoceroses on the available crystallographic structures for mitochondrial-encoded proteins, those for cytb and co co and co. despite some of the differences occurring in functionally relevant sites, we were unable to observe any direct relationship between them and the markedly different environments inhabited by the woolly, in contrast to the extant rhinoceroses. phylogeny and speciation times of the rhinoceros the mitochondrial genomes of the six rhinoceros species were analysed using bayesian and likelihood-based phylogenetic methods. in order to infer the position of the root, the sequences of two perissodactylan outgroup species were included in the analyses. we find very strong support for each of the three sister-species pairings among the rhinoceroses. this is in agreement with previous molecular findings and most morphological reports. split decomposition produced a graph with good representation of the phylogenetic signal, but with an obvious lack of resolution among the three pairs of rhinoceros species. similar graphs were produced using split decomposition with other distance measures, including logdet-transformed distances. bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated data set revealed mixed support for three candidate topologies. the relative topological support varied according to outgroup choice, although support was generally weak. in only one case was there significant support for a particular tree topology. likelihood-based tree topology tests, performed using the concatenated alignment with both outgroups, yielded no significant support for any particular tree topology. there was slight support in favour of the topology in which the white, black, sumatran, and woolly rhinoceroses group together to the exclusion of the indian and javan rhinoceroses. there was low support for the grouping of the white, black, indian, and javan rhinoceroses, and for the grouping of the indian, javan, sumatran, and woolly rhinoceroses. regardless of the topology test used, all three candidate topologies were always included in the 95% confidence set. acontrol region excluded ball third codon sites excluded ccontrol region and all third codon sites excluded analyses using individual components of the mitochondrial genome revealed wide variations in relative support for the three candidate topologies. several genes exhibited strong support for particular topologies: nd cox and cytb in the bayesian analyses, and cox in the maximum-likelihood analyses. bayesian estimates of divergence times within rhinocerotidae, calculated using two fossil-based calibrations, were similar across different tree topologies. the estimated age of the common ancestor of the six rhinoceros taxa was around myr, with a 95% highest posterior density interval of about 28– myr. the next divergence within the group occurred only around – myr afterwards, with a very considerable overlap in the 95% hpd intervals of these two adjacent nodes. on average across the three topologies, the mean time separating these two nodes represents only % of the total tree height. *95% highest posterior density interval time is in millions of years before the present. discussion as ancient dna techniques have advanced, the complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct taxa are now regularly being included in dna analyses. initial complete ancient mtdna genomes were generated using conventional overlapping-pcr and sanger sequencing techniques, yielding the mtdna genomes of three moa species, several woolly mammoths, and the mastodon. these genomes were successfully used to resolve long-standing phylogenetic questions, including the ratite and elephantidae phylogenies. notably, both questions were those for which prior analysis of smaller mitochondrial and nuclear fragments had yielded contradicting results. in light of these successes, therefore, our inconclusive findings come as a surprise. previous morphological studies, along with restriction enzyme mapping studies, have supported the horn-based topology grouping the black and white rhinoceroses with the sumatran and woolly rhinoceroses. more recent studies of morphological and dna data have favoured the geography-based topology, grouping all the asian species together to the exclusion of the african species. with the complete mitochondrial genomes, however, the third possible candidate grouping cannot be statistically rejected. the discrepancy between the results of the present and previous studies led us to investigate the topologies supported by each individual mitochondrial gene. the signal varied considerably among genes, with 3– genes supporting each of the three candidate topologies. the considerable heterogeneity in topological support among mitochondrial genes is unusual due to the non-recombining mode of genomic transmission, but echoes similar results obtained for elephantids and for chloroplast genes in asplenium ferns. a possible explanation for the lack of resolution could be the short divergence time among the three sister-species pairings of only ~ myr, leaving little time to accumulate mutations in the ancestral branches; thus, the poor resolution might be indicative of a hard polytomy. the cause of the multiple defining speciation events of the rhinoceros family is unknown, but can be identified as having occurred during the early oligocene. a less likely explanation for the lack of phylogenetic resolution, posited by shepherd et al. to explain the phylogenetic conflicts among chloroplast genes in ferns, is that recombination might have occurred in the rhinocerotid mitochondrial genome. finally, it is possible that the mitochondrial tree does not provide an accurate reflection of the underlying species phylogeny, a question that will need to be addressed using data from multiple nuclear loci.  we have demonstrated that, in addition to hair, nail is an excellent substrate with which complete mitochondrial genomes can be generated from old or ancient material. using these substrates we have generated the sequences of four previously unpublished rhinoceros mtdna genomes. although several previous studies of partial mtdna genomic sequences apparently resolved the long-standing question as to the true phylogeny of the recent rhinoceros species, we have demonstrated that these estimates were probably misled by sampling error. furthermore, even when using complete mitochondrial sequences, we are unable to resolve the tree topology. thus, for the rhinoceroses at least, dna analyses have not yet been able to provide a solution to the evolutionary history of this challenging taxon. several possible steps might be taken to resolve this problem. one would be the inclusion of dna sequences recovered from a more closely related outgroup species, such as members of the elasmotherium genus. unfortunately however, the age of known specimens likely precludes the survival of dna in them. thus it is probable that satisfactory resolution of the phylogeny will instead require the incorporation of substantial amounts of nuclear dna data. "," the scientific literature contains many examples where dna sequence analyses have been used to provide definitive answers to phylogenetic problems that traditional approaches alone have failed to resolve. one notable example concerns the rhinoceroses, a group for which several contradictory phylogenies were proposed on the basis of morphology, then apparently resolved using mitochondrial dna fragments.  in this study we report the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of the extinct ice-age woolly rhinoceros, and the threatened javan, sumatran, and black rhinoceroses. in combination with the previously published mitochondrial genomes of the white and indian rhinoceroses, this data set putatively enables reconstruction of the rhinoceros phylogeny. while the six species cluster into three strongly supported sister-pairings: the black/white, the woolly/sumatran, and the javan/indian, resolution of the higher-level relationships has no statistical support. the phylogenetic signal from individual genes is highly diffuse, with mixed topological support from different genes. furthermore, the choice of outgroup has considerable effect on reconstruction of the phylogeny. the lack of resolution is suggestive of a hard polytomy at the base of crown-group rhinocerotidae, and this is supported by an investigation of the relative branch lengths.  satisfactory resolution of the rhinoceros phylogeny may not be achievable without additional analyses of substantial amounts of nuclear dna. this study provides a compelling demonstration that, in spite of substantial sequence length, there are significant limitations with single-locus phylogenetics. we expect further examples of this to appear as next-generation, large-scale sequencing of complete mitochondrial genomes becomes commonplace in evolutionary studies.

101," long terminal repeat retrotransposons are class i transposable elements that replicate by a ""copy-and-paste"" mechanism, called retrotransposition, which is quite similar to lentivirus replication. higher plant genomes, especially of the grasses, harbor a large number of these elements, which form the vast majority of the nuclear dna. retrotransposition involves a reverse transcription step, where cdna is synthesized from an rna template. reverse transcription is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, which is generally encoded by the retrotransposon being copied, and the cdna is inserted into a new genomic location by the integrase, which is also self-encoded. a canonical retrotransposon insertion comprises two ltrs and an internal domain containing the coding domain for integrase, reverse transcriptase, a proteinase, the structural protein gag, and the signals for reverse transcription. many composite structural patterns derived from canonical ltr retrotransposon insertions were previously identified in bacs and others long genomic sequences from various plants. these appear primarily as nested insertions of one retroelement into another. the nests can comprise more than three or four layers arranged in a ""russian doll"" fashion. in some cases, the nested retroelements are solo ltrs rather than elements containing two ltrs and a central domain. the solo ltrs are thought to arise from non-reciprocal recombination between the ltrs of a single element. in addition to the nests, some complex insertions are characterized by a third ltr shared between two potentially complete elements. understanding the mechanism through which this class of retrotransposon complex is derived is required for a full vision of genome evolution. authors have previously described them as merely the result of recombination between the proximal ltrs of two adjacent retroelements, leading to the elimination of the intervening genomic sequence. here we will describe another possible origin of these complex insertions, an abnormal template-switching during the reverse transcription step.  in the genome of arabidopsis thaliana, after thorough analyses, devos et al. identified no complex elements other than those originating from recombination between two retroelements. for these, the two outermost ltrs differ from each other by not being derived from the same reverse transcription and integration. this has two structural consequences. first, a recombination between the 3' ltr from one element and the 5' from another, closely related one on the same strand gives rise to a third, internal ltr. this ltr is a chimera of the two ltrs involved in the recombination. a second consequence, because the two elements involved come from two independent insertion events that generated two different target-site duplications, is that the resulting complex does not harbor flanking tsds. by these measures, the vast majority of the complex elements already identified arose from unequal and heterologous recombination between adjacent and independent insertions. nevertheless, a careful analysis of the complex insertions of available large genomic sequences from the triticeae has revealed that there is another group of complex elements. accession af contains an angela-like complex in position 11808–. accession ay also includes an angela-like complex. these two complex insertions harbor features that are not consistent with an origin through recombination. first, they have flanking bp direct repeats, a length characteristic for tsds of copia elements. in addition, their two external ltrs of the set of three are highly homologous. the presence of flanking tsds supports their origin from a single integration event. the high similarity between the outside ltrs is consistent with their origin, furthermore, from a single cycle of reverse transcription. based on these observations, we checked within other poaceae sequences for the occurrence of such complex structures. we carried out an ab initio scan of the rice pseudomolecules and all the available genomic sequences from maize, using the ltr_struc software for detection of complete ltr retrotransposons. this software detects only complete elements, based on the presence of both two ltrs and the tsd motifs flanking them. out of identified potential ltr retrotransposons, we were able to clearly identify new complex structures harboring the diagnostic features: an internal ltr, complete core sequences, flanking tsds and similarity between the outermost ltrs. the first element is located on chromosome of rice, in position 14011139–, in the forward orientation. this element is a member of the squiq subfamily, with caaac as the tsd sequence. the second detected complex is a member of the opie family in the maize bac ay, in position 57992– reverse orientation, with gcatg as the tsds. a model that can explain complex insertions such as these involves abnormal template switching as a part of reverse transcription. immediately preceding reverse transcription, the rna matrix forms a loop, using the high homology between the two r regions within the ltrs to buckle the two ends of a single template together. this allows the -strand cdna, which otherwise cannot proceed once it reaches the 5' end of the rna template, to jump across to the 3' end and continue. the jump is called template switching. the process leads to perfect identity between the 5' and the 3' ltr of the newly synthesized element, because the r and u segments of the 5' ltr and the u segment of 3' ltr in the rna are copied into both ltrs of the cdna. the cdna is ultimately inserted into a new genomic location by the integrase. the enzyme ligates the cdna to one strand of the asymmetric double-strand break in the host dna, which is formed concomitantly with the ligation. the repairing of this break leads to the tsd. errors in template choice during the reverse transcription can occur anywhere along the sequence. the growing cdna can jump to the other packaged template instead of to the other end of the template it is already on. generally, because the two packaged templates are almost identical, the phenomenon is undetectable because there are no major modifications to the resulting cdna. however, if two different rnas are packaged in the same virus-like particle, a jump to the other template during reverse transcription leads to abnormal or new elements, opening a new mode for ltr retrotransposon evolution. the vejul and bare elements appear to have been formed in this way. if rnas from two slightly different individual ltr retrotransposons are co-packaged, the strand switch could occur also between the two r regions. this would lead to formation of a heterodimer rather than a normal monomer. the resulting cdna would constitute a chimeric complex between the two elements, and possess chimeric ltrs. the process of reverse transcription described above renders the external ltrs identical. their 3' ends would be therefore also identical and could serve as substrates for the same type of integrase. thus, a chimeric complex element nevertheless would be integrated via standard integrase catalysis, leading to a new genomic insertion harboring tsds on either side. the dimerization could occur between the two packaged rnas from highly similar elements, such as closely related members of the same retrotransposon family, leading to a complex harboring three identical ltrs interspersed between two similar internal regions. moreover, because the ltrs would be complete and not compromised by heteroduplex formation, each of them would be able to promote the expression of its corresponding downstream element. thus, the two original elements could be expressed as normal and individual copies and even propagate through the genome as separate elements.  only one template-switching complex could be identified on the mb sequence of the rice genome, one on the available maize sequences, and none in the arabidopsis genome. on the ~ mb of sequences currently available for the triticeae, two template-switching complexes were identified out of the recombinant complex elements recognized. although such chimeric complexes, formed by reverse transcription, form a relatively minor share of the genome when compared to those formed by post-insertional recombination, they appear nonetheless to be more abundant in the triticeae genomes than elsewhere. the genome of diploid barley is roughly × bp and that of hexaploid bread wheat about × bp. if the observed frequency of two of these complexes in the available sequences holds throughout the barley and wheat genomes, the two cereals should harbor ca. complexes formed by reverse transcription. formation of these complexes is another manifestation, together with low replication fidelity and transduction of genomic sequences, of the fluid and flexible nature of retrotransposition. furthermore, the complex elements reported here may point to mechanistic differences between plant species, in view of the differences in their abundance between the species we were able to examine. data in italics were produced from the re-annotated sequences of. the recombination events represent all the deletions, insertions, and remodeling events detectable in the elements. the model we propose is consistent both with the available data and with the established details of the retrotransposon life cycle. a direct demonstration of the mechanism would entail isolation of virus-like particles containing two paired rnas and demonstrating the rna structure. this, however, awaits both an efficient system for production of packaged complexes and a means of distinguishing the number of mrnas present within the buckle. "," the ltr retrotransposons of higher plants are replicated by a mutagenic life cycle containing transcription and reverse transcription steps. the dna copies are often subject to recombination once integrated into the genome. complex elements, where two elements share an ltr, are not uncommon. they are thought to result from heterologous recombination between two adjacent elements that occurs following their integration.  here, we present evidence for another potential mechanism for the creation of complex elements, involving abnormal template switching during reverse transcription. the template switching creates a large, complex daughter element, formed by the fusion of two parent sequences, which is then inserted into the genome.  those complex elements are part of the genome structure of plants in the poaceae, especially in the triticeae, but not of arabidopsis. hence, retrotransposon dynamics shaping the genome are lineage-specific.

102," the human t cell antigen receptors of αβ and γδ t lymphocytes are believed to assemble in a similar fashion. first, variable αβ or γδ heterodimers bind to invariant cd3δε heterodimers, then to cd3γε heterodimers and finally to cd homodimers, resulting in surface tcr complexes with equal amounts of the two different, albeit highly homologous, cd heterodimers. in contrast, mouse αβ and γδ tcr differ drastically in their stoichiometry, since the γδ tcr does not incorporate any cd3δε dimers but, rather, two cd3γε dimers. this finding begs the question as to whether the human variable αβ and γδ chains show identical affinity for both cd heterodimers. we reasoned that, if both the αβ and the γδ tcr isotypes use identical amounts of cd3γε and cd3δε, then decreased availability of cd3γ or cd3δ proteins, as observed in heterozygous carriers of mutations in cd genes, would be expected to have a similar impact on the assembly and surface expression of both αβ and γδ tcr isotypes. to test this hypothesis, we compared tcr surface levels of primary αβ and γδ t cells from healthy haploinsufficient donors carrying null or leaky mutations in cd3g or cd3d. the results did not support the hypothesis of a similar impact on both tcr isotypes, but rather suggested a differential cd3γε and cd3δε usage scheme for each tcr isotype.  reduced surface αβ and γδ tcr expression in cd3γ+/−, cd3δ+/− or cd3δ+/leaky human t lymphocytes cd3g or cd3d haploinsufficient donors were uniformly healthy and showed abundant peripheral blood t lymphocytes with an essentially normal phenotype. however, total t cell numbers were consistently lower than controls which correlated with a partial impairment of lymphocyte function. amean ± sd of the indicated number of different subjects. when available, multiple values from single donors were included as single means in the calculations. data obtained from several sources, including published material. bpercentage proliferation referred to the maximum response of a healthy control in each experiment. we have previously observed in γ−/− individuals that cd expression levels are overestimated when t cells are defined using antibodies against tcr-associated epitopes, such as bma or immu. to avoid a similar bias in haploinsufficient donors, tcr-independent electronic gates were first defined in order to identify αβ or γδ t cell subsets. the results indicated that cd3+ cells within cd4+ or cd8bright lymphocytes were >98% αβ t cells, whereas cd3+ double negative lymphocytes were 78 ± 6% γδ t cells. accordingly, αβ and γδ t cells were gated as cd4+/cd8bright and dn cells, respectively, for further analyses. using several cd3-specific antibodies, analysis of surface tcr expression consistently showed reduced antibody binding in γ+/− and δ+/− t lymphocytes as compared to normal controls. these results were confirmed in family members of two newly reported patients with a leaky mutation in cd3d. consistent with their relatively higher cd3δ content as compared to δ+/− donors, δ+/leaky donors showed a milder, but nevertheless clear decrease in surface tcr expression. in order to establish if these results were associated with reduced availability of each cd chain, we measured intracellular cd3γ or cd3δ by flow cytometry in haploinsufficient γ+/− and δ+/leaky donors. the results showed that this was indeed the case, confirming previous reports of decreased cd3γ protein in haploinsufficient donors. serial dilutions of cd mab further confirmed the findings above, since the reduced binding to γ+/− t cells persisted in saturation conditions, but it was gradually lost near the endpoint, supporting the existence of less cd binding sites. from these results we conclude that human cd3g or d haploinsufficient donors show reduced binding of cd3-specific mab to the tcr of their γδ and αβ t cells. discordant reduction of surface αβ and γδ tcr expression in cd3γ+/− but not cd3δ+/− or cd3δ+/leaky human t lymphocytes analysis of cd mab surface binding to αβ and γδ t cells with the different cd3g and cd3d genotypes, relative to normal controls, revealed that binding of cd mab to γ+/− γδ t cells was unexpectedly poor as compared with γ+/− αβ t cells. this discordant reduction was specific for γ+/− donors, as it was not observed in δ+/− or δ+/leaky donors. further support for this discordant reduction was provided by the γδ versus αβ cd expression ratio, which is normally  ±  but becomes significantly less in γ+/− donors only. taken together, these results indicate that normal surface γδ tcr expression in humans is more critically dependent on the relative availability of cd3γ, but not cd3δ, than that of the αβ tcr. discussion human and mouse tcr complexes are assembled into octamers following common cues provided by transmembrane ionizable aminoacids in each dimer, with cd3γε and cd3δε ectodomains contributing additional extracellular interactions for their ordered incorporation into the complex. the extracellular interactions are quite specific, as the mouse γδ tcr does not incorporate otherwise available cd3δε dimers, but rather two copies of the highly homologous cd3γε dimer. in sharp contrast, the human γδ tcr incorporates both. mammalian cd3γ, but not cd3δ, has a uniquely kinked ectodomain which fits into an asymmetrical loop in tcrβ for optimal αβ tcr assembly and expression, and cannot be easily replaced by cd3δ due to steric hindrance, with functional consequences. this likely leads to the conserved structural asymmetry shared by the human and mouse αβ tcr. in contrast, tcrγ lacks the asymmetrical loop of its tcrβ homologue and seems to allow a less stringent cd dimer usage in the γδ tcr, which may explain its disparate stoichiometry in the two species. the present study suggests that there must be differential structural constraints for the building and stable expression of αβ and γδ tcr complexes, as revealed by their discordant behaviour in cell surface expression when confronted with reduced availability of cd3γ, but not of cd3δ. our findings are in agreement with available information about the assembly of human surface αβ and γδ tcr, as explained above and as proposed in figure in the model, cd3δε dimers show a similar affinity for the human tcrα and tcrδ chains, thus reduced cd3δ expression has a similar impact on both. in contrast, when cd3γ is limiting, lack of a cd3γε-fitting structure in tcrγ, as opposed to tcrβ, may result in a lower affinity of the former relative to the latter for cd3γε. this may favour the incorporation of competing cd3δε dimers to nascent γδ tcr complexes, and would ultimately lead to γδ tcr receptors devoid of the required stability for optimal surface expression. moreover, human tcrδ can stably recruit not only cd3δε but also cd3γε during step which may reduce further the availability of cd3γε dimers for step when cd3γ is limiting. further studies are required to demonstrate a direct link between cd3γ or δ availability and tcr assembly and surface expression. however, the paucity of cd haploinsufficient individuals might hamper these studies in humans. a flow cytometry-based approach as illustrated in figure 2b could help to identify such individuals. lastly, since carriers of cd3g or cd3d mutations showed affected tcr expression and t-cell selection, which seemed in turn to impair to some extent t-cell function the question of whether they also have increased risk of immunological dysfunction deserves further investigation.  the results indicate that the dimer assembly scheme of the human tcr complex is different in αβ versus γδ t cells, as revealed by their discordant behaviour when confronted with limiting amounts of cd3γ, but not of the homologous cd3δ chain. the novel data allow proposing a modified version of the prevailing tcr assembly model. "," the t cell antigen receptors of αβ and γδ t lymphocytes are believed to assemble in a similar fashion in humans. firstly, αβ or γδ tcr chains incorporate a cd3δε dimer, then a cd3γε dimer and finally a ζζ homodimer, resulting in tcr complexes with the same cd dimer stoichiometry. partial reduction in the expression of the highly homologous cd3γ and cd3δ proteins would thus be expected to have a similar impact in the assembly and surface expression of both tcr isotypes. to test this hypothesis, we compared the surface tcr expression of primary αβ and γδ t cells from healthy donors carrying a single null or leaky mutation in cd3g or cd3d with that of normal controls.  although the partial reduction in the intracellular availability of cd3γ or cd3δ proteins was comparable as a consequence of the mutations, surface tcr expression measured with anti-cd3ε antibodies was significantly more decreased in γδ than in αβ t lymphocytes in cd3γ+/− individuals, whereas cd3δ+/− and cd3δ+/leaky donors showed a similar decrease of surface tcr in both t cell lineages. therefore, surface γδ tcr expression was more dependent on available cd3γ than surface αβ tcr expression.  the results support the existence of differential structural constraints in the two human tcr isotypes regarding the incorporation of cd3γε and cd3δε dimers, as revealed by their discordant surface expression behaviour when confronted with reduced amounts of cd3γ, but not of the homologous cd3δ chain. a modified version of the prevailing tcr assembly model is proposed to accommodate these new data. t cellscd3haploinsufficiency ",51292c33-6545-4848-84a1-40f71b88a807,pubmed
103," array-based comparative genomic hybridization allows the identification of genome-wide dna gains and losses in cancers and genetic diseases. an ideal acgh platform should possess the following features: 1) it should be available to study a broad range of organisms. unfortunately, acgh microarrays are commercially available for human and mouse studies only, leaving out other model organisms for dna copy number studies. 2) the acgh platform should be commercially available worldwide to make results from different laboratories easily comparable. in-house microarrays frequently show less reproducibility than commercial products. the microarray quality control consortium study highlighted once again that in-house microarrays generate a much higher coefficient of variation for expression signals compared to commercial products. comparison of results generated at independent laboratories is frequently problematic when different probes are used at different laboratories. 3) probes should span short regions to provide detailed information on regions of copy number variation; bac clones, used as acgh probes, due to their average probe length being several ten thousand nucleotides, inherently can not measure small amplified or deleted regions. 4) the platform should provide small spacing between probes to generate high density maps of cnvs; the only commercially available bac acgh array available measures at a median resolution of one megabase. 5) individual measurements should provide reliable data to avoid necessity of averaging multiple measurements, resulting in decreased resolution. long oligonucleotide arrays and snp microarrays depend on averaging signals from multiple probes to eliminate false positive measurements, resulting in decreased resolution. 6) cnv measurements should be easily correlated with expression data when the same samples are studied on the genomic and transcriptomic level. bac clones and probes designed for snp measurement inherently are not specifically designed to interrogate transcribed genes. therefore, combining dna copy number and expression data needs strong bioinformatics support. 7) the analytical procedure should interrogate the entire genome; the dna labeling protocol for snp microarrays depends on complexity reduction, leaving out significant parts of the genome from analysis. here we present gene resolution analysis of copy number variation, a method utilizing the most frequently used expression microarray platform for acgh. for human and mouse studies, this platform provides over measurements across the genome. furthermore, the same technology is available for more than a dozen other organisms with comparable genome coverage. the probes are short oligonucleotides and probe sets span on average short chromosomal regions. without complexity reduction, genomic dna is fragmented, labeled and hybridized to these microarrays. after re-annotation of probe sets for interrogation of genomic dna, wpp, a data analysis algorithm originally developed for expression analysis, is utilized for calculation of dna copy number variation. since the vast majority of acgh data available today has been generated using bac microarrays, gracnv results have been compared to results from bac microarrays with high genome coverage.  properties of the u plus expression array as an acgh tool the u plus array provides over probe sets interrogating the human genome and over of the probe sets measure cnvs directly within transcribed genes. with over genes measured on the u plus array, the majority of the predicted to human genes is covered. probe sets interrogate short regions and density of probe sets is high. the 19k bac microarray used for comparison has even higher genome coverage but probes are much longer. benefits of the wpp algorithm rma, a standard data analysis algorithm for calculation of expression estimates from affymetrix genechips was used initially for calculation of dna copy number differences. principle components analysis of rma data grouped the normal control dnas together but separated sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l. these two cell lines were derived from the same cell line and have only been propagated by two different laboratories for approximately ten passages independently. therefore, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l should be similar to each other and should cluster together. pca of wpp estimates grouped the normal control dnas together, clearly separated from the cell lines and within the cell lines, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l showed most closely related results. hierarchical clustering of wpp estimates similarly groups related samples together, whereas rma estimates again separated the two closely related cell lines sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l. therefore, further analysis was performed using wpp estimates of dna copy numbers. detection of copy number variations in large chromosomal regions for large chromosomal regions, circular binary segmentation yields similar pictures of amplification and deletion in imr- neuroblastoma cells from bac arrays and expression arrays. two highly amplified regions on chromosome and one surrounding mb) are well known in neuroblastoma. the amplicon at mb contains the mycn oncogene and its amplification status is used for clinical sub-classification of neuroblastoma. deletions of 1p and 11q, as well as gains of 17q are also hallmarks of neuroblastoma and all of these copy number variations were observed in imr- cells by both platforms. the major differences observed between copy number measurements by bac arrays and expression arrays affect centromeric regions. these regions are highly polymorphic in normal genomic dna; therefore, we speculate that these differences are caused by the different normal control dnas used for both platforms. for the remaining cell lines sk-n-as, sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l, bac acgh and gracnv also provided similar pictures of copy number variations for large chromosomal regions too. for sk-n-sh/g and sk-n-sh/l, two sub-cultures of sk-n-sh, the observed overall picture of copy number variation compared to normal dna was very similar except for an additional amplification on 1q present in sk-n-sh/l. this amplification was observed by both cgh platforms. high resolution analysis of copy number variations at higher resolution, bac acgh and gracnv again provide similar pictures of amplifications and deletions in cancer cell lines. in imr- cells, two recently discovered sub-amplicons at and mb of chromosome two have been identified by cbs in gracnv data, while only the sub-amplicon at mb was identified in bac acgh data. in sk-n-sh/g cells, segmentation identified from gracnv data a deletion of less than one mb at mb of chromosome eight, which was not automatically detected in bac acgh data. gracnv provides information from four independent probe sets on this deletion. bac acgh as used herein, with more than percent genome coverage provided information from one bac clone only. bac acgh provided information on two further amplicons in 2p in imr- cells. these regions are not covered by the u plus array. detection of copy number variations between normal genomic dnas at a single gene locus genomic dna of normal healthy individuals has been discovered during the last years to harbor a high number of copy number variant regions. as an example, we show a region on chromosome know to harbor the well-characterized cnv of the c4/cyp21a locus. normal, healthy individuals with and copies of the c4/cyp21a locus have been identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. this gene-level cnv is represented in the gracnv data. connection of cnv and expression data gracnv utilizes expression arrays for cnv measurements and therefore the same microarray can be used for analysis of gene expression. genomic and transcriptomic data can be combined easily. as an example, we show combined dna copy number and expression data of the megabladder mouse model. an approximately mb region of chromosome was duplicated in this mouse mutant, as identified by fish analysis. gracnv showed il1rap, a gene within the amplicon to be excluded from higher copy numbers, a finding confirmed by quantitative pcr. expression analysis showed four of the five amplified genes to be overexpressed in mutant whole embryos, while the bladder showed over-expression of three genes only. discussion our study shows that the most frequently used commercial oligonucleotide expression microarray platform can be utilized for measurement of copy number variation. after re-annotation of probe sets, these expression arrays provide a high-resolution platform for cnv analysis. many acgh platforms depend on averaging measurements from adjacent loci to remove noise and avoid false positive reports of copy number variation. gracnv on the other hand, reports the bias-corrected median of measurements from eleven adjacent probes within a probe set. therefore, gracnv shows low false discovery rates and further averaging is not vital. affymetrix expression arrays provide for many genes more than one probe set for measurement. to allow easy interpretation of results, we averaged results of multiple probe set measuring the same gene. an even higher resolution of cnv analysis could be accomplished when the newly released expression arrays for measurement of individual exons would be utilized. for sample labeling, we used standard chemistry for snp analysis from the same provider, hybridization and washing protocols are also well established by many laboratories for snp analysis. therefore, it should be easy to adapt gracnv by other laboratories. affymetrix currently provides expression microarrays for over organisms and gracnv can be applied to all of these organisms. additionally, gracnv provides copy number information comparable to data generated using one of the highest density bac acgh arrays available. hybridization of genomic dna to expression arrays produces higher background cross-hybridization than hybridization of labeled mrna transcripts. we speculate that the reason why the rma algorithm failed to identify the close similarity of two cell lines derived from the same donor was because rma did not correct for sequence-specific differences in background. wpp, the algorithm introduced here for cnv measurements, utilizes mismatch probe signals for sequence-specific background correction and has been used successfully for expression analysis by one of our laboratories for several years. due to the fact that gracnv uses a one chip per sample principle, the range of cnvs within normal genomic dnas can be taken into consideration for measurement of disease-related cnvs and a free software for this calculation is provided on our website.  the present study describes a novel method of gene resolution analysis of copy number variation yielding high-resolution maps of dna copy number changes and applicable to a broad range of organisms for which commercial oligonucleotide expression microarrays are available. results are comparable to bac acgh with high genome coverage. due to the standardized oligonucleotide microarrays, gracnv results can be compared between laboratories and can easily be combined with gene expression data using the same platform. "," array-based comparative genomic hybridization is a high-throughput method for measuring genome-wide dna copy number changes. current acgh methods have limited resolution, sensitivity and reproducibility. microarrays for acgh are available only for a few organisms and combination of acgh data with expression data is cumbersome.  we present a novel method of using commercial oligonucleotide expression microarrays for acgh, enabling dna copy number measurements and expression profiles to be combined using the same platform. this method yields acgh data from genomic dna without complexity reduction at a median resolution of approximately base pairs. due to the well-defined nature of oligonucleotide probes, dna amplification and deletion can be defined at the level of individual genes and can easily be combined with gene expression data.  a novel method of gene resolution analysis of copy number variation yields high-resolution maps of dna copy number changes and is applicable to a broad range of organisms for which commercial oligonucleotide expression microarrays are available. due to the standardization of oligonucleotide microarrays, gracnv results can reliably be compared between laboratories and can easily be combined with gene expression data using the same platform.

104," expression microarrays, with the capability to measure the mrna expression level of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously, have found broad application in both clinical and basic research. with the generation of large data sets from microarray experiments, statistical methods are needed to extract useful information. many methods have had specific implementations written for the analysis of gene expression data, such as various forms of clustering, self ordered maps, singular value decomposition and significance analysis. however, these methods all rely on the assumption that there are no gross process errors in the original data. previous analyses of systematic errors in microarray data have focused on problems at the level of sample preparation, labelling, or hybridization. this report focuses on steps in the microarray production process prior to hybridization that may ultimately result in errors in the underlying data. much of the microarray data published at stanford is based on mouse and human arrays produced under controlled and monitored conditions at the brown and botstein laboratories and at the stanford functional genomics facility. nevertheless, as large datasets based on the stanford human array began to accumulate, a small but significant number of discrepancies were detected that required a serious attempt to track down the original source of error. due to a controlled process environment, sufficient data was available to accurately track the entire process leading to up to the final expression data. in this paper, we describe our statistical methods to detect the inconsistencies in microarray data that arise from process errors, and discuss our technique to locate and fix these errors. we are able to fix those errors that originate at the level of any microtiter plate used during a multi-step microarray production process. the major process fail points in cdna microarray production at stanford are shown in table it is at these points that misidentifications can occur. other types of processes resulting in expression data will have their own possible fail points. regardless of the particular process, for the sake of subsequent error checking it is important to track every instance where samples have moved from one microtiter plate to another, or from microtiter plate to microarray. our process involves four such reallocations: from an archival 96-well block to a 96-well growth block, then to a 96-well pcr plate, then to four 384-well print plates and finally to 10– thousand element microarrays. even in highly automated bar-coded and vision controlled systems the possibility exists that plates might become swapped, skipped, misordered, or rotated by degrees during one of the process steps. our own process is fairly well automated, but like most academic and commercial efforts our process involves hand loading of robots. for example in our case, during the transfer from to 384-well format, it is possible to accidentally rotate a 96-well plate or misorder the or 384-well plates. during printing a 384-well plate might be accidentally skipped, swapped or printed in the wrong orientation. even with the best engineering controls to prevent plate rotations, the potential exists for misidentified plates. inconsistencies in our data were first detected both by visual inspection of microarray data as well as the appearance of anomalously large first components in singular value decomposition analyses of ovarian tumour data traced to different production batches of arrays. our algorithm was developed to detect and repair these types of errors, using the similarities in expression levels between sets of spots from different microarrays. the algorithm was used to check all of the microarray data in our database for which there was a sufficient process record. the general idea, illustrated in figure is as follows: partition the microarray expression data from a single microarray into sets based on the various microtiter plates the samples have been in throughout their process history. for example, at stanford we keep our process fairly simple, with a minimum of plate changes, so our spotting material can be said to have existed in either well or 384-well format during its entire process history. thus, we partition the data into sets corresponding to the or 384-well plate history. next, an expression vector for each element of the partition based on absolute expression levels is formed and compared to every other expression vector from every other plate on many other array batches. a rank matrix of correlation coefficients is formed which should be close to unity on the diagonal and far from unity off the diagonal. non-unitary diagonal elements indicate problems with that plate comparison. a rank comparison of the best correlations can be made to find swapped plates. the algorithm can be repeated assuming a rotated plate to check to see if the discrepancy can be attributed to a plate rotation. it should be noted that in cases where no process error is indicated, the method can still indicate the presence of problem plates, print batches or pcr rounds that should be flagged for particular attention in downstream analyses. our algorithm is for arrays produced in the brown and botstein laboratories and the stanford functional genomics facility. however, the ideas are general and can be applied to many other types of high throughput operations. in most of the research studies using our human microarray, a common reference is compared against a tumour or tissue specimen. the common reference is usually labelled with the cy dye, pseudo-colour green in most visualizations of the data, while the sample specimens are labelled with cy dye, pseudo-colour red. subtle corrections due to background subtraction issues and normalization are not important for this analysis. because a common reference is used in a large number of hybridization experiments at stanford, all of the cy intensities across various kinds of experiments are comparable. we measure the similarities of two sets of spots by taking the correlations between the common reference intensities of these two sets of spots. for those experiments that do not use common reference, the comparison is made using experiments with similar samples in either the cy or cy channel.  finding misidentified data this example is from the analysis of experiments from an ovarian tumor dataset that first led us to develop mufu. here, it was noticed that similar tissues were not clustering across batch boundaries as expected. also, an anomalously large first component in a singular value decomposition analysis pointed to problems at the array batch level. after some detective work, visual inspection uncovered anomalies in certain print plates as seen in figure we were able to isolate the problem to distinct sets of 96-well plates that had been swapped during an upstream process step, probably during the transfer from 96-well plates to 384-well plates. not wishing to go through this sort of process again and again, mufu was developed to more succinctly recapitulate this finding and apply it to all data. with mufu, a check using a 384-well plate partition of the data shows a discrepancy but no obvious plate rotation or misidentification. we then repartition and repeat our tests at the 96-well plate level. the results are shown in table 2a where we show a way pair wise comparison. the first four comparisons are for batches whose print plates are made from the first pcr round. the middle four compare the first pcr round to the second, and the last four compare batches from the second pcr round. mismatches are evident in the middle set of comparisons. from table 2b we see that the distance matrix identifies a match between plate h and plate i and plate n and plate o for all four comparisons of the first pcr round to the second. in all four comparisons, the two distributions resolve themselves well, as can be seen in figure leading to the conclusion that h and i are swapped, and n and o are swapped, most likely in the plates from the first pcr round. the ambiguity is broken by sequencing a small sampling of wells, which confirms that the misidentifications are in the print plates from the first round of pcr, and not the second. in figure we show the effect on the ovarian data after the correction has been applied. also, in figure we show how, via visual inspection of the actual spots on an array, one can verify that the fix has properly reorganized the data. the figure shows spots from the four different affected 96-well plates before and after the fix is applied. finding a 384-well plate rotation we compare four arrays a a a and a from a particular print production batch a to four arrays b, c, d and e from four other distinct print production batches. the total number of well microtiter plates in print batch a is the results of the plate rotation test are shown in table 3a. here we see plate p, identified in both the rank and rotated-rank matrices across print batches is a clear candidate for a plate rotation. the data from the distance matrix comparisons is shown in table 3b. in figure we show the distributions of the diagonal elements of the distance matrix and the rotated-distance matrix. these distributions are well resolved and allow us to easily distinguish data due to a plate rotation from noisy data. finding a misidentified 384-well plate in this example we compare four arrays a a a and a from a particular print batch a to four other arrays b, c, d and e from four other distinct print batches. as seen in table 4a no plate is found to be a candidate for plate rotation, however we do find that plate q has a poor self-match comparison. indeed, when the distance matrix is examined, we see the plate matches instead plate r across the four array comparisons. we check the three criteria for plate misidentification and summarize these data in table 4b. in figure we show the distributions of the match and mismatch distributions. these distributions are quite distinct and give us confidence that we can distinguish the proper match from an accidental match. discussion out of the million features checked in our database using mufu, problems were detected and corrected on million of them. that we were able to find and correct both previously known and unknown problems gives us confidence in the algorithm. that so few problems existed overall reassures us as to the robustness of our process in general. microarray data, by its sheer volume, presents interesting laboratory information management challenges. the data arrive at the investigators desk after a significant number of steps. we have found that the better you track production, quality control, and experimental steps, the better chance you have of uncovering the reasons behind discrepancies that may appear in the data. often, statistical analyses look only at the data presented as final expression values or ratios, without taking into account relevant quality control data. in our effort to understand our errors and the source of large systematic discrepancies in our data we have found the mufu algorithm a useful test of certain classes of process errors, and as a check for general problems with specific process steps or microtiter plates. we use mufu to find, verify and fix problems that can be attributed to an error in plate processing. we also flag plates for which we can find no specific problem but we see yield inconsistent results. these may be plates that, at some point in the process, had a problem that was not detected while the process step was being carried out. the fact that we can test the data, using our standard quality control hybridizations, for these types of quality issues is reassuring and has helped us gain confidence in our data. obviously, there are many other classes of error that creep into microarray data. aside from the gross process errors that are amenable to detection, as we have described here, there is also a large class of more subtle systematic errors that can contribute to the overall systematic error on the expression ratio measurement. isolating the source of these individual errors is sometimes quite difficult. properties of the microarray feature such as spot size, shape and uniformity can contribute, but the majority of systematic errors are introduced at the time the experiment is performed. slide post processing, rna quality, labelling, hybridization and washing all lend the possibility for introducing systematic errors. improvements in protocols and hybridization apparatus have helped reduce these errors and should continue to do so in the future. as these sources of error are identified and eliminated, expression microarrays will continue to provide progressively more sensitive measures of gene expression.  process errors in any genome scale high throughput production regime can lead to subsequent errors in data analysis. we have shown the value of tracking multi-step high throughput operations by using this knowledge to detect and correct misidentified data on gene expression microarrays. we generalized our procedure using a simple heuristic, which found and fixed several problems with the proper assignment of gene identifier with physical microarray feature. we found thirteen print runs that had four plates mistracked, six print runs with single plate rotations, and one instance of a plate rotation at the well plate level. one skipped plate was detected, as well as one plate printed twice. out of the million features checked in our database using mufu, problems were detected and corrected on million of them. that we were able to find and correct both previously known and unknown problems gives us confidence in the algorithm. that so few problems existed

105," tumor classification is performed on microarray data collected by dna microarray experiments from tissue and cell samples. the wealth of such data for different stages of the cell cycle aids in the exploration of gene interactions and in the discovery of gene functions. moreover, genome-wide expression data from tumor tissues gives insight into the variation of gene expression across tumor types, thus providing clues for tumor classification of individual samples. the output of a microarray experiment is summarized as an p × n data matrix, where p is the number of tissue or cell samples and n is the number of genes. here n is always much larger than p, which degrades the generalization performance of most classification methods. to overcome this problem, feature selection methods are applied to reduce the dimensionality from n to k with k <<n. feature selection chooses a subset of the original features according to the classification performance; the optimal subset should contain relevant but non-redundant features. feature selection can help to improve the generalization performance of classifiers, and to reduce learning time and the time required to classify out-of-sample data. there has been a great deal of work in machine learning and related areas to address this issue. in most practical cases, relevant features are selected and kept as input, while irrelevant and redundant features are removed. although the removed features are redundant and weakly relevant, they contain useful information that can be used to improve prediction accuracy. multi-task learning is a method of using the redundant information by selecting features from the discarded feature set to add to the target. although mtl achieves only limited improvement, it is nevertheless useful for real world cases like medical problems and multivariate calibration problems. previous studies of search methods for multi-task learning mainly used heuristic methods, where the number of features selected for the input and/or target is somewhat arbitrary. when the search method is regarded as a combinational optimization problem, random search methods can be used. the genetic algorithm is a simple and powerful method which has obtained satisfactory results for feature selection. motivated by this, we proposed the random method ga-mtl, but ga-mtl did not consider irrelevant features in the data sets. here we propose an enhanced version of ga-mtl which codes one feature with two binary bits. the e-ga-mtl algorithm and others are applied to tumor classification on microarray data sets; it is found that e-ga-mtl outperforms all other algorithms considered.  in order to demonstrate the benefits of multi-task learning methods, we have performed the following series of experiments using artificial neural networks as classifiers. all is a baseline method; without any selection, all the genes are input to the ann for classification. ga-fs uses a genetic algorithm to select genes and input selected genes to the ann. h-mtl uses a heuristic embedded feature selection method to search features, where some of the selected features serve as input to the ann and some of the features are added to the output. ga-mtl uses a genetic algorithm to search features, where some of the selected features are input into ann and some of the features are added to the output. ga-mtl-ir uses an embedded algorithm to remove irrelevant features and then uses a genetic algorithm to search features, where some of the selected features serve as input to the ann and some of the features are added to the output. e-ga-mtl also uses a genetic algorithm to search features, and employs two bits to represent one feature; some features are considered as irrelevant and discarded, some of the selected features serve as input to the ann, and some of the features are added to the output. the most important parameter of an ann is the number of nodes in hidden layer, m. to reduce the effect of this parameter we ran the experiments with both m = and m = while different data sets, including data sets with only the selected features, need different optimal parameters for different methods, we do not try to find the optimal parameters, because: it is infeasible to find the optimal parameters, because this is an np-hard problem. we are not interested in obtaining the best performance of one special method on a given data set; instead, we are interested in demonstrating the effect of our proposed framework. prediction performance the average bacc values are shown in figures and for different values of the ann parameters, where all means all the genes are used as input for classification without any gene selection. from figures and we conclude that: on average and for all the data sets, the multi-task learning algorithms h-mtl, ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir, and e-ga-mtl perform better than the feature selection algorithms ga-fs and all. on average and for almost all the data sets, the genetic algorithm based multi-task learning algorithms ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir and e-ga-mtl perform better than h-mtl, a heuristic algorithm. only on the leukemia data set, for an ann with m = hidden units, does h-mtl perform slightly better than ga-mtl and ga-mtl-ir. on average, e-ga-mtl performs the best among all the learning algorithms. although ga-fs performs worse than the multi-task learning algorithms, it performs better than those without any gene selection. detailed statistical values of bacc, correction, sensitivity, specificity, and precision are also listed in tables, and from which we conclude that: although the results for anns with m = are better than those for m = we can draw similar conclusions for both series of results in terms of how the different methods compare. for all the measures, on average, multi-task learning algorithms including h-mtl, ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir, and e-ga-mtl perform better than ga-fs and all, and genetic algorithm based multi-task learning algorithms like ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir, and e-ga-mtl perform better than h-mtl. both e-ga-mtl and ga-mtl-ir remove irrelevant genes; both obtain better results than the others for the specificity, precision and bacc measures, on average. but ga-mtl-ir performs worse than ga-mtl for other measures like sensitivity and correction. e-ga-mtl performs the best among all the learning algorithms on average, for all the measures. it greatly improves results for the bacc, sensitivity and specificity measures. the number of selected features we show the number of features selected by each algorithm in tables and which also lists the number of discarded features, input features, and target features. for ga-fs, the features are selected as input or are discarded. for ga-mtl, the features are selected as input or are added to the target; no features are discarded. for h-mtl, ga-mtl-ir, and e-ga-mtl, the features are selected as input, are added to the target, or are discarded. from tables and we can see that: for ga-fs, about one third of genes are removed and two thirds are used for classification. furthermore, the ratio of the number of input features to the number of output features for ga-mtl is similar to the ratio of the number of input features to the number of discarded features for ga-fs. h-mtl and ga-mtl-ir both use the same prediction risk criterion to discard irrelevant features, so the features discarded are the same and hence the number of discarded features are the same. the number of input features and output features are different, however. h-mtl has a predetermined number of input and output features; one quarter of the selected features are used for the input, and the other three quarters are added to the output. in contrast, for ga-mtl-ir, the features are determined by a genetic algorithm, but the ratio of the number of input features to the number of output features is similar to that of h-mtl. for e-ga-mtl, although the number of input, output and discarded features are determined automatically by the genetic algorithm, the ratios among these numbers are similar to those for h-mtl and ga-mtl-ir. discussions we have demonstrated that genetic algorithm based multi-task learning methods perform better than the heuristic methods and feature selection methods, and that e-ga-mtl performs the best of all the methods considered. several questions come immediately to mind: why does multi-task learning succeed? in a previous study, caruana et al. gave an explanation of why multi-task learning succeeds. here we combine their results with the framework presented here. yu and liu proposed to categorize the features into four classes, namely: i: irrelevant features, ii: weakly relevant and redundant features, iii: weakly relevant but non-redundant features, and iv: strongly relevant features; where iii and iv comprise the optimal feature subset and i and ii should be removed using feature selection methods. we have found that ii contains useful information. these features should not be discarded, but rather should be used in the learning process. multi-task learning is a method to use these redundant features to improve the prediction accuracy of the base learning method, which accounts for its improved performance. why do genetic algorithms perform better than the heuristic method? our results demonstrate that genetic algorithm based multi-task learning methods outperform heuristic multi-task learning methods. the chief reason why this is so is that the heuristic method considered here uses the feature ranking technique to select features for the input and the target, which does not consider feature redundancy and/or feature interaction. at the same time, is somewhat arbitrary to use a prespecified number of features for the input and the target. this is another factor which reduces the performance of the heuristic method. in contrast, when the genetic algorithm selects features for the input and the target, it simultaneously considers feature redundancy and/or feature interaction. so it automatically determines the number of features for the input and target. in fact, kudo and sklansky proved that genetic algorithms have a higher probability of finding better solutions to naive feature selection problems than other complete, heuristic and random algorithms. among the genetic algorithm based multi-task learning methods, e-ga-mtl performs better than ga-mtl-ir. the number of features removed by e-ga-mtl is determined automatically by the genetic algorithm, while the number removed by ga-mtl-ir is prespecified. this is further evidence that genetic algorithm based approaches outperform heuristic approaches. what effect do irrelevant features have on multi-task learning? the effect of multi-task learning on irrelevant features can be observed by comparing the results obtained by e-ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir, and ga-mtl; e-ga-mtl and ga-mtl-ir remove irrelevant features, while ga-mtl does not. here we observed that e-ga-mtl and ga-mtl-ir outperformed ga-mtl, especially for the sensitivity and bacc measures. this shows that irrelevant features will degrade the generalization performance of multi-task learning methods, and reduce the robustness of the methods; they should therefore be removed before the learning process.  random search methods of multi-task learning, including ga-mtl, ga-mtl-ir and e-ga-mtl are shown to improve the accuracy of multi-task learning and to make multi-task learning more convenient to use. experimental results on microarray data sets for tumor classification showed that genetic algorithm based multi-task learning performed better than h-mtl, a heuristic multi-task learning method, and ga-fs, a naive feature selection method based on genetic algorithms. furthermore, our results showed that e-ga-mtl and ga-mtl-ir, which remove irrelevant features, performed better than ga-mtl, which does not. e-ga-mtl, which employs a genetic algorithm with a two bit encoding to remove irrelevant features and select features for the input and output, performed best. since analysis of microarray data sets is a high dimensional problem, our results demonstrate that multi-task learning techniques can be employed to improve prediction performance of tumor classification by using redundant genes. furthermore, our results demonstrate that genetic algorithms can be employed to improve multi-task learning by discarding irrelevant features and by selecting the input and target features automatically; ga-mtl and e-ga-mtl are shown to to improve generalization performance of classifiers on microarray and other high-dimensional data sets. "," since the high dimensionality of gene expression microarray data sets degrades the generalization performance of classifiers, feature selection, which selects relevant features and discards irrelevant and redundant features, has been widely used in the bioinformatics field. multi-task learning is a novel technique to improve prediction accuracy of tumor classification by using information contained in such discarded redundant features, but which features should be discarded or used as input or output remains an open issue.  we demonstrate a framework for automatically selecting features to be input, output, and discarded by using a genetic algorithm, and propose two algorithms: ga-mtl and e-ga-mtl. experimental results demonstrate that this framework is effective at selecting features for multi-task learning, and that ga-mtl and e-ga-mtl perform better than other heuristic methods.  genetic algorithms are a powerful technique to select features for multi-task learning automatically; ga-mtl and e-ga-mtl are shown to to improve generalization performance of classifiers on microarray data sets. 25– june the international conference on bioinformatics & computational biology las vegas, nv, usa ",f6a98349-56e1-4617-9905-428d0642aaf0,pubmed
106," characteristic fragrance in aromatic rice leads to its popularity worldwide and the aromatic traits have been extensively incorporated into commercial and hybrid rice breeding programs. the fragrance occurring in many aromatic rice varieties has been shown to be associated with the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which has also been identified in a great variety of food products. in the thailand fragrant rice variety khao dawk mali 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline formation and strong aroma emission has been found to be positively correlated with an accumulation of proline. although the biochemical pathway leading to the fragrance is largely unknown, l-proline has been demonstrated to be a possible precursor in the production of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in rice plants. the inheritance of fragrant trait in rice has been well documented. genetic investigations implicated that the fragrant trait of rice was controlled by a single recessive locus. a number of genetic analyses using reciprocal crosses repetitively showed the aromatic trait is characteristics of recessive monogenic inheritance without impact from cytoplasmic genes. nevertheless, tsuzuki & shimokawa reported that two genes were responsible for the construction of the aromatic trait. in addition, several investigations by using different aromatic rice cultivars also showed that two recessive genes were involved in the segregation of aromatic and non-aromatic traits. furthermore, genetic studies revealed that the underlying gene responsible for the aroma production was located on chromosome. by using translocation and trisomics lines derived from non-fragrant rice cv. ir aromatic trait was also mapped to the chromosome. in a recent study involved eight aromatic hybrid rice maintainer lines, a single recessive locus spanning ssr markers rm and rm on chromosome was identified to tightly link with the fragrant trait. physical mapping revealed that several candidate genes including a rice betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase homolog on chromosome was co-segregated with aroma production. meanwhile, a delicate study demonstrated that the aroma production in fragrant genotypes was well correlated with the multiple mutations in the fragrance rice locus that is identical to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase on chromosome. however, direct evidence proving the function of osbadh in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production is lacking. furthermore, traditional aromatic cultivars have often undesirable agronomic performance, such as poor yield, susceptibility to pests and diseases, and strong shedding. the molecular mechanism of this major weakness occurred in the aromatic rice cultivars is largely unknown. in present experiments, we sequenced the osbadh locus derived from a number of aromatic rice cultivars across china and uncovered that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele also occurred in all the tested fragrant accessions. by using rna interference technique combined with agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated t-dna transfer, we show that the directed degradation of osbadh transcripts results in a significantly elevated fragrance emission and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline accumulation, unambiguously suggesting that osbadh locus is responsible for aroma production in fragrant rice varieties. in addition, disrupted osbadh leads to a detectable reduction of crop productivity, implying its multiple functions in secondary metabolism and agronomic performance. a strategy to compromise the favorable aspects and to avoid the unfavorable effect during osbadh manipulation and breeding is discussed as well.  expression and nucleotide variation at the osbadh locus the cv. nipponbare was used to determine the expression patterns of osbadh total rnas were extracted from roots, stems, leaves and flowers of mature plant, as well as embryos, seedling roots, seedling stems, seedling leaves. messenger rna levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. the results show osbadh is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots. we examined genetic variation in a bp portion of osbadh gene in fragrant and six non-fragrant rice accessions that are representatives of cultivated varieties across china. multiple mutations identical to fgr allele identified by bradbury et al. were also observed in all the fragrant accessions. these mutations contain a total of six snps and eight deletions within a bp region of the exon as compared to the wild type allele in the tested non-fragrant varieties. deficient in osbadh expression resulting in apparently sensory aroma production to dissect the physiological role of osbadh we generated a large number of transgenic rice plants expressing osbadh2-rnai. construct was introduced into non-fragrant rice cv. nipponbare by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated t-dna transfer. the majority of osbadh2-rnai primary transgenics resulted in pcr amplification with primers designed to the hpt marker. preliminary aroma evaluation revealed that out of hpt-positive t plants showed abundant fragrance emission. ten t segregating populations derived from independent t plants with obvious aroma production were selected and cultivated in the university's farm. leaves from the first and second crops and grains from the first crop of individual t plants were used for sensory evaluation of aroma production. as a result, the presence and absence of fragrance is unambiguously segregated within t populations and well consistently expressed in leaves and grains from the same plants. in all the t1-segregating populations, we observed a correlation of osbadh2-rnai transgene integration with apparently sensory aroma production. to investigate property of the emitted aromatic compound from the transgenic lines, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted for thai hom mali, transgenic line and the wild type control. as shown in figure a considerable aroma production of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline was detected in both thai hom mali and transgenic line, by contrast to the undetectable wild type control. in order to test if the aroma production is co-segregated with the presence of t-dna insertion in the transgenic segregating progeny, t mature leaves from five osbadh2-rnai repression plants and four non-fragrant wild-type plants segregated out from the same transgenic line were collected and subjected to the gc-ms analysis. as a result, 2ap accumulation was apparently enhanced in all the downregulation plants, by contrast to the undetectable wild-type plants without fragrance. to ensure that the observed phenotypes are correlated with reduced endogenous transcript, total rna was extracted from leaves of wild type plants and four independent osbadh2-rnai repression lines. analysis of semi-quantitative rt-pcr and real-time quantitative rt-pcr revealed a considerable reduction in endogenous osbadh transcript levels in osbadh2-rnai repression lines compared to that of wild-type plants. to determine if the expression of osbadh gene is affected in the down-regulated osbadh transgenic lines, we conducted real-time pcr analysis to detect the osbadh cdna levels in the osbadh2-rnai repression lines. the osbadh gene is the closest available homolog of osbadh and is almost unaffected in the down-regulated osbadh lines. disrupted osbadh influencing crop productivity to investigate the effects of down-regulated osbadh on crop productivity, the plant height and 1000-grain weight of osbadh2-deficient and wild type plants derived from four independent t transgenic lines were measured. the results showed the reduction in plant height as well as 1000-grain weight in the osbadh2-deficient plants is differentially detectable when compared to the wild-type plants segregated out from the transgenic progenies. * significant at p < compared to non-fragrant wild-type plants segregated out from the same transgenic line. to further address the physiological functions of the osbadh gene, wild type seeds and t seeds derived from four independent transgenic lines were germinated in various salt-stressed conditions. no significant difference in sprouting index and germination rates between wild type and osbadh repression lines was observed. nevertheless, the seedling growth rates in different salt concentrations were more or less inhibited in osbadh2-deficient lines as compared to wild type. discussion by using rna interference technique in this experiment we have generated a number of transgenic plants expressing camv35s-osbadh2-rnai construct. molecular analyses combined with panel sensory evaluation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrates downregulation of osbadh transcripts in the transgenic plants results in significant elevation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production. this result is well consistent with the previous fine mapping data. interestingly, extensive sequence analysis in this and previous studies indicates that both the traditional and modern fragrant rice varieties with diverse origins possess the same mutant allele, suggesting the donor mutation leading to fragrance probably has a single evolutionary origin. distinctly, this spontaneous mutant allele prevalently present in all the tested fragrant rice varieties probably represents the capacity for plants to evolve phenotypic modifications in response to local cultural preferences. the mutant may occur even before rice domestication and disperse worldwide over the course of the domestication. rice badh belongs to aldehyde dehydrogenases superfamily comprises a group of divergently related enzymes that catalyze the irreversible nad+-dependent oxidation of a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids and occur in most well-studied organisms. a distinct function of this gene family is involved in environmental stresses responses and tolerance. indeed, there are two closely related betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs present in rice genome. several studies showed that glycine betaine accumulation in rice plants was undetectable, indicating a possible functional defect resulting from an unusual post-transcriptional processing at choline monooxygenase and/or betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase loci specifically for glycine betaine biosynthesis. the current transgenic experiment demonstrates down-regulated osbadh expression leads to reduced crop productivity, indicating a bona fide activity of the gene product encoded by osbadh functioning in crop performance. actually, the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of osbadh has been recently demonstrated in an independent study. intriguingly, a unique function of rice badh involved in aroma production has been apparently implicated by rnai-mediated expression repression. this result has been recently confirmed in an independent experiment. at present, the biochemical pathway leading to aroma production in rice has not been established. the recessive nature of mutant fragrant allele suggests that a loss of function is responsible for the accumulation of fragrant compound. in present experiment, down regulation of osbadh mrna level resulting in elevated aroma production further suggests the multiple mutations in the fragrant allele most likely give rise to a loss-of-function version of osbadh and thereafter account for the aroma production. accordingly, we are able to speculate the functional osbadh protein encoded by the wild allele may catalyze a reaction that consumes either 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline or an upstream precursor of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in a competing pathway. obviously, to further elucidate the biochemical pathway of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline accumulation, additional gene loci involved in aroma metabolism need to be identified. to harness the positive effects of osbadh gene suppression in aromatic rice production without the collateral negative effects on crop performance, we could inhibit accumulation of the functional osbadh mrna either by rna interference specifically in rice grain using osbadh2-derived inverted-repeat constructs driven by endosperms-specific promoters, or by incorporating the loss-of-function spontaneous mutant aromatic allele into one of the parental lines in hybrid rice. due to the recessive nature of spontaneous mutant aromatic allele, the vegetative growth of the heterozygous f plants of the hybrid rice varieties will not be adversely affected, while the endosperm homozygous for the mutant allele derived from the heterozygous f hybrids will produce and accumulate fragrant compound.  this study indicates that down-regulated expression level of osbadh gene favorably enhances the accumulation of aromatic compound, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. in addition, the sequencing data suggests the prevalent aromatic allele of spontaneous mutation has a single evolutionary origin. "," aromatic rice is popular worldwide because of its characteristic fragrance. genetic studies and physical fine mapping reveal that a candidate gene homologous to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for aroma metabolism in fragrant rice varieties, but the direct evidence demonstrating the functions of osbadh is lacking. to elucidate the physiological roles of osbadh sequencing approach and rna interference technique were employed to analyze allelic variation and functions of osbadh gene in aroma production. semi-quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, as well as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were conducted to determine the expression levels of osbadh and the fragrant compound in wild type and transgenic osbadh2-rnai repression lines, respectively.  the results showed that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele occur in the fragrant rice accessions across china; osbadh is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots; the disrupted osbadh by rna interference leads to significantly increased 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production.  we have found that the altered expression levels of osbadh gene influence aroma accumulation, and the prevalent aromatic allele probably has a single evolutionary origin.

107," acinetobacter baumannii is one of the common bacterial species responsible for hospital-acquired infections. the prevalence of multi-drug resistant a. baumannii in hospitals has been increasing worldwide, representing a serious challenge for clinical management and public health. investigation on the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii in local settings could generate useful data to understand the local epidemiology of this opportunistic pathogen and therefore lay a foundation for an effective infection control program. previous studies have focused on the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii but the vast majority of these studies were retrospective and used a collection of isolates either from outbreaks or with little information on their representativeness. for hospitals in sichuan, southwest china, a. baumannii was a huge problem as it was the most common bacterial species associated with hais and accounted for % of putative pathogens causing hais in a point prevalence survey. outbreaks due to a. baumannii had also been reported in our hospitals. a snapshot study was therefore performed to investigate the clonal relatedness of a. baumannii clinical isolates in our local settings.  among non-repetitive isolates that were recovered from clinical specimens from june to june in hospitals in sichuan and were putatively identified as a. baumannii by automated microbiology systems, isolates were validated to be a. baumannii. the vast majority of the a. baumannii isolates were recovered from sputa or respiratory tract secretions. the remaining six isolates were from ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, drainage, pleural fluid or wound secretions. as for the clinical significance, a. baumannii isolates were considered as either colonizers or pathogens causing clinical infections. about half of the a. baumannii isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems, which was in consistence with the 53% carbapenem resistance rate of a. baumannii in the report of chinese ministry of health national antimicrobial resistance investigation net. many isolates were non-susceptible to sulbactam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or cotrimoxazole while all isolates were susceptible to polymyxin and rifampicin and only one isolate was non-susceptible to minocycline. blaoxa- was the only acquired carbapenemase gene that was detected. interestingly, it was present in 35/ carbapenem-non-susceptible and 5/ carbapenem-susceptible isolates. blaoxa- has been the most common carbapenemase gene in china, as a previous study reported that out of imipenem-non-susceptible a. baumannii isolates collected from chinese cities had blaoxa-. although blaoxa- encodes a carbapenemase, this gene has also been detected in carbapenem-susceptible isolates before. the isolates were assigned to pulsotypes determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, suggesting quite diverse clonal relatedness. a total of sequence types, including new sts, were assigned for the isolates using the multi-locus sequence typing with the pubmlst scheme. as the gdhb gene sequence was not obtained from isolate d despite repeated attempts using various primer pairs, the st could not be assigned for this isolate. of note, two isolates of the same pulsotypes were assigned to different sts, st and st however, st and st were found to be single locus variants to each other. this was in consistence with a previous study reporting that isolates belonging to the same puslotype were not always of the same sts. a. baumannii clinical isolates st 1 1 2 3 glta - gyrb - gdhb - reca - cpn60 - gpi - rpod bla oxa-23 1nd, not determined. for new sts and the undetermined st by the pubmlst scheme, sts determined using the pasteur mlst scheme are shown after the slash “/” with new sts being underlined. 2cc, clonal complex. s, singleton. ccs for sts determined using the pasteur mlst scheme are shown after the slash “/”. the members of ccs for sts determined using the pubmlst scheme in table  other than cc are listed as below. cc: st st st st st st554;

108," the package gennon-h presented here simulates dna sequences evolving on a given phylogenetic tree directly from the transition matrices. in other words, the goal of developing gennon-h was to generate dna sequences following discrete-time markov models on a given phylogenetic tree. given a phylogenetic tree t, the parameters of these models are the root distribution and the substitution matrices pe assigned to each edge e of t. the entries of pe correspond to the conditional probabilities p that a nucleotide y at the parent node of e is substituted by nucleotide x at the child node. there is no extra restriction on these matrices, in contrast to continuous-time processes, where the substitution matrices are the exponential of a rate matrix q multiplied by the number of events. whereas generating matrices of type exp with a preassigned number of substitutions is relatively easy, the task of generating markov matrices with a preassigned expected number of substitutions per site has been recently solved in. the software gennon-h is implemented for the jukes-cantor jc kimura two k and three k parameters, strand symmetric ssm, and general markov models gmm. the shape of the substitution matrices for jc k k ssm and gmm models is given by: abbbbabbbbabbbbaabcbbabccbabbcbaabcdbadccdabdcba abcdefghhgfedcbaabcdefghijklmnop. for these models, the algorithms given in can generate any stochastic matrix corresponding to a given branch length. we refer the reader to for more details and references of these models. in the continuous-time models, the process is often assumed to be homogeneous and the rate matrix q is common throughout the entire tree. this is not an implicit hypothesis for the discrete-time markov processes, thus the evolutionary processes simulated using gennon-h are nonhomogeneous. although a variety of methods exist for simulating alignments under the continuous-time models, we provide the first software for generating multiple sequence alignments evolving under the discrete-time markov processes on trees. other powerful software include the bayesian phylogenetic methods of and. mrbayes is a robust inference and model selection method, which provides a variety of tools for nucleotide and amino-acid data analysis. beast enables to generate msa with rate matrices differing at distinct edges. however, both packages are based on the rate-based continuous-time models for nucleotide data and as such, assume the exponential form of the substitution matrices. this in turn restricts the space of possible matrices assigned to a given edge length. gennon-h, which aims to explore the space of all matrices, mimics the stochastic character of evolution as attempted to be captured by mathematical models. gennon-h is the first software tailored specifically for the purpose of generating the dna sequence alignments evolving on phylogenetic trees under the nonhomogeneous models. gennon-h does not aim to replace the existing methods, but to serve as an option for researchers, whose interest lies in testing the performance of the algorithms on data generated under the assumption of more general models. a newly created software empar, enables to infer the parameters of the model considered in this work. it is worth pointing out that the strand symmetric model and the general markov model considered in gennon-h do not lie in the class of stationary models, which adds to the flexibility of the framework presented here. as a comparison, we note that the software packages that are prevalently in use consider only stationary and time-reversible models. this is due to the fact that the continuous-time models require computing exponentials of rate matrices, which is a nontrivial task for a general matrix. this contributes to the practice of using the time-reversible rate-based models irrespective of the setting under consideration. as shown in, the substitution parameters for the gmm model, are identifiable up to permutation. in gennon-h we fabricate matrices of the diagonal largest in column type, whenever possible, i.e. matrices whose largest entry in every column is placed on the diagonal. dlc matrices share an important feature of being identifiable– there exists a unique set of substitution matrices satisfying the dlc condition and a unique root distribution that leads to the given joint distribution at the leaves. in other words, the data generated from the dlc matrices and sufficient alignment lengths have high likelihood of being identifiable and therefore can be safely used to test hypotheses about the tree or the data. implementation gennon-h has been implemented in c++. its input is a tree in the newick format with annotated branch lengths. other arguments include the base name of the output files, length of the alignment and a model. an exemplary command-line input is:./gennon-h treefilename outputfilename length modelname for instance, if ‘tree.txt’ is a text file consisting a newick 5-taxon phylogenetic tree::,species4:,species5: ), then the following command line input./gennon-h tree.txt data.fa k81 generates a msa of length nt evolving on the tree given in ‘ tree.txt’ under the k model. the result is recorded it in the file ‘data.fa’. the algorithm proceeds as follows: input: a discrete-time markov model m, a phylogenetic tree t with assigned branch lengths in the newick format, and an alignment length l; step 1: generate a dna sequence s0of length l at the root of t according to distribution of the model m; step 2: for each edge e in t, using, we generate a matrix pe of the type m corresponding to the length le of edge e ). if the resulting matrix is not dlc, we apply a permutation of rows to convert it to a dlc matrix. every model has a set of permutations allowable, such that the form of the matrix dictated by the model is maintained. if neither of the permutations creates a dlc matrix, we generate a new matrix pe and repeat the procedure. we limited the number of trials to before the simulations require a re-start, however, in practice a dlc matrix is expected to be found in much fewer iterations; step 3: we let s evolve according to the corresponding markov process on t; output: a multiple sequence alignment and the substitution matrices used for its simulation. the output files constitute both a fasta file with a multiple sequence alignment simulated on t, and a file listing the parameters used for the simulations of the data. the order of the output matrices corresponds to the order in which the branches of the newick tree are read: terminal edges are put first, followed by the top-down listing of the edges starting at the root.  the c++ implementation of gennon-h can be accessed at the project home page http://genome.crg.es/cgi-bin/phylo_mod_sel/alggennonh.pl, at sourceforge, or in the additional file accompanying this paper. the algorithm has been successfully used in to test a new model selection method based on and 6-taxon dna multiple sequence alignments. the size of the tree is not a limiting factor to the use of the code as the execution time grows linearly in the number of taxa, thus the method can be used to generate data of any size. in order to test the speed of gennon-h, we investigated the times it took to generate alignments of nt on the following 5-taxa tree:,seq4:,seq5: ). the results are given in table the simulated data saved in the output files together with the parameters used for its simulation are suited for hypothesis testing in a variety of biological applications.  gennon-h is the first software simulating dna sequences directly from the transition matrices computed from the branch lengths of a given phylogenetic tree. it implements discrete-time markov processes on phylogenetic trees on any number of taxa. in the current release the support was given to the most well-known discrete-time markov models: the jukes-cantor, kimura

109," schmallenberg virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented, rna virus belonging to the bunyaviridae family, within the genus orthobunyavirus. the virus was discovered in connection with outbreaks of diarrhoea, reduced milk production and fever in cattle in germany and the netherlands and has since the initial discovery rapidly spread to many european countries. although infection is often connected with milder symptoms it can cause foetal abortions and malformations in ruminants. sbv was the first orthobunyavirus detected in europe, but the genus consists of over viruses grouped into serogroups and many of these are important pathogens. in humans, this includes for example la crosse virus causing encephalitis and ngari virus causing haermorrhagic fever. animal pathogens, apart from sbv, includes akabane virus and cache valley virus that also infect ruminants and can cause abortions and congenital malformations. the sbv genome consists of three segments coding for four structural proteins and two non-structural proteins. through the production of recombinant viruses lacking nss delnss), nss has been shown to be a major virulence factor for orthobunyaviruses as these deletant viruses are attenuated and show reduced growth rate compared to wild type virus. sbv nss has also been shown to be able to counteract host antiviral responses. recombinant sbv lacking ability to express nss is a potent inducer of type i ifn while sbv does not induce the ifn response after infection. apart from interfering with the ifn pathway, sbv nss has also been shown to induce degradation of the rpb subunit of rna polymerase ii and to potentially have a pro-apoptotic role. however, little is known about the overall inhibitory effects and targets of orthobunyavirus nss proteins on gene expression in infected cells. therefore, in this study we analysed the changes in the transcriptome of primary bovine cells following infection with either wild type sbv or sbvdelnss.  viral infection and sequencing output – quality and reference assembly we carried out rna-seq analysis in infected and mock-infected primary bovine cells, in order to use cells with an intact cell-autonomous innate immune system. bovine primary fibroblasts were infected with either sbv, sbvdelnss or mock-infected and rna was extracted at 16 h p.i.. three biological replicates were assesses for each sample and cells were also infected in parallel for immunofluorescence and western blot in order to confirm that the bovine primary cells were infected by sbv and sbvdelnss at 16 h. both the sbv and the sbvdelnss infected cells were positive for the virus with an estimated infection rate at about 30%.figure infection of sbv and sbvdelnss in bovine primary cells. immunofluorescent

analysis were sequenced on illumina miseq. on average, million reads/sample were generated with a phred quality value of or higher and % of the sequence reads assembled against the bos taurus genome using tophat. mrna enrichment was carried out prior to sequencing and bunyaviruses in general lack a poly-a tail in their genome and mrnas, consequently no assembly against the virus genome was performed. differential expression analysis cuffdiff was used to identify differentially expressed genes. de genes were identified and most were found in the sbvdelnss infected cells. hence, the majority of the de genes are as a direct or indirect result of the loss of nss. most of the de genes affected by the loss of nss were upregulated and fold differences ranged from -fold to the 1-fold cut-off value. the fold changes for down-regulated genes were more subtle, ranging from -fold to the 1-fold cut-off. the de sequence analysis was validated for genes using sybr green realtime pcr; the fold changes for sbvdelnss compared to the sbv infected cells were all significant and corresponded to the sequencing data.figure analysis of differentially expressed genes 16 h p.i. venn diagram of

such as type i ifn-signalling and ifn-dependent gene expression, as well as pattern recognition. this is also evident when extracting the top most upregulated genes as most of these have antiviral functions. the major molecules involved in viral rna recognition including ddx, trim ifih, pkr, tlr were highly up-regulated in sbvdelnss infected cells, as are those involved in antigen presentation to cd8+ t-lymphocytes including mhc i α/β and tap 1/. as a consequence of activation of the viral rna recognition pathways many interferon stimulated genes such oas1/ mx and several guanylate binding proteins, were upregulated. several interleukins were found among the de transcripts, for example il- and its downstream molecules involved in inflammation, activation of angiogenesis and leucocyte

dependently and independently of ifn. for example, zapata jc et al. showed that lasv strongly induce viperin early in infection while the attenuated ml has a weaker and delayed viperin induction suggesting that ml has a mechanism to interfere with the host-response signalling pathways. antiviral activity of rsad has been shown against for example bunv, chikungunya virus, influenza virus and dengue virus through different mechanisms such as inhibition of viral replication and budding/egress. mx has also been shown to have antiviral activity against a number of different rna viruses such influenza and bunyaviruses. mx is significantly upregulated in foetuses infected with cvv and it has been proposed to be involved in the clearance of the virus. during lacv infection mx can bind to the nucleocapsid and inhibit viral replication. also, isg is upregulated during foetal infection with cvv. the oas proteins performs their antiviral activity through the activation of rnasel which leads to degradation of cellular and viral rna and oas but not oas is reported to contribute to a slight inhibition of bunv and bunvdelnss viruses. hence although very few genes were up regulated during sbv infection most of the upregulated genes have all been previously shown to have antiviral activity for other similar viruses indicating that these genes, individually or collectively, may have an important role in the antiviral response and the consequent restriction of sbv infection. however, it should be noted that we only investigated host responses at one time point, and it is possible that at an earlier or later time point during the viral replication cycle, more de genes may be found, as shown for dengue virus for example. as not all primary cells were infected by sbv or sbvdelnss it is possible that weak host responses to sbv might be masked by transcripts from uninfected cells. this may also explain why the de analysis of sbv infected cells did not show a general host transcription shutdown as described, although mrna turnover and cell types used in this and other studies may be further reasons. only one transcript was down-regulated in sbv infected cells compared to uninfected cells. this gene was also down-regulated in sbvdelnss-infected cells, indicating that this change is not due to the nss protein alone. this is a transcription factor that negatively regulates myogenic proteins. knockout studies of the murine homolog, inhibitory of myogenic family, have shown that lack of l-mfa can lead to embryonic lethality and placental defects as well as skeletal patterning defects. although, the high viral levels of sbv seen in brain tissue are likely to cause the teratogenic effects seen during sbv infection the down-regulation of mdfi in sbv and sbvdelnss infected cells is potentially of interest in relation to foetal abnormalities linked to sbv infection. future studies will determine whether sbv and sbvdelinss affect expression of mdfi in fetal brain tissue.  we have investigated the effect of sbv infection on the host transcriptome and more specifically the effects induced by lack of nss expression. our results show the response to orthobunyavirus infection in a relevant host cell system and that nss is very efficient in shutting down the immune response of the host but that despite this a number of known antiviral proteins are still induced during sbv infection. the data from this study serves to identify possible antiviral factors and serve as a basis for more detailed mechanistic studies of sbv and other orthobunyaviruses as well as the mechanism of action of their nss protein. "," schmallenberg virus is a member of the orthobunyavirus genus causing malformations and abortions in ruminants. although, as for other members of this family/genus, the non-structural protein nss has been shown to be an interferon antagonist, very little is known regarding the overall inhibitory effects and targets of orthobunyavirus nss proteins on host gene expression during infection. therefore, using rna-seq this study describes changes to the transcriptome of primary bovine cells following infection with schmallenberg virus or with a mutant lacking the non-structural protein nss providing a detailed comparison of the effect of nss expression on the host cell.  the sequence reads from all samples assembled well to the bovine host reference genome. during infection with sbvdelnss, genes were differentially expressed compared to uninfected cells and many of these were known antiviral and ifn-stimulated genes. on the other hand, only nine genes were differentially expressed in sbv infected cells compared to uninfected control cells, demonstrating the strong inhibitory effect of nss on cellular gene expression. however, the majority of the genes that were expressed during sbv infection are involved in restriction of viral replication and spread indicating that sbv does not completely manage to shutdown the host antiviral response.  in this study we show the effects of sbv nss on the transcriptome of infected cells as well as the cellular response to wild type sbv. although nss is very efficient in shutting down genes of the host innate response, a number of possible antiviral factors were identified. thus the data from this study can serve as a base for more detailed mechanistic studies of sbv and other orthobunyaviruses. keywords schmallenberg virusorthobunyavirusrna-seqtranscriptomeantiviral responsenon-structural protein nssissue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",bdaf7887-7b65-4cb5-960d-db10efb56725,pubmed
110," the prediction of rna structure has received increasing attention over the last decade as the number of known functional rna sequences, called non-coding rna, has increased. these new ncrna sequences range in size from micrornas to xist. they serve numerous roles, from modulating gene expression to catalyzing reactions. one of the first steps to understanding the mechanism of action of an rna is to determine its structure. secondary structure, defined as the set of canonical base pairs, can be determined using comparative analysis if a large number of sequences are available. in comparative analysis, base pairs are determined when they are conserved in multiple sequences and instances of compensating base pair changes occur. compensating base pair changes demonstrate the conservation of structure in spite of sequence not being conserved, for example a gc base pair in one sequence being replaced by a homologous au pair in another sequence. comparative analysis, however, requires both significant user input and a large number of homologous sequences that can be aligned. as an alternative to comparative analysis, the secondary structure of an rna can be predicted for a single sequence using thermodynamics. the thermodynamic methods are based on nearest neighbor rules that predict the stability of a structure as quantified by folding free energy change. often, structure prediction is accomplished by finding the lowest free energy structure, which is the single most probable structure in a folding ensemble. alternatively, structures can be sampled from the boltzmann ensemble and a centroid, i.e. representative structure, determined. another alternative method for structure prediction is the prediction of a structure with the highest sum of pairing probabilities, called the maximum expected accuracy structure. single sequence secondary structure prediction is reasonably accurate. on average, for sequences of fewer than nucleotides, the accuracy of predicting known base pairs is as high as 73%. the accuracy, however, benchmarked lower when longer sequences were included. additional sources of information can be used to improve accuracy. for example, base pair probabilities can be determined using a partition function and highly probable pairs are more likely to be correctly predicted pairs. alternatively, using two or more homologous sequences to determine a conserved structure can result in significantly more accurate structure prediction. experimental data, such as enzymatic cleavage, chemical mapping, oligonucleotide array binding, shape, and nmr data can all be used to improve structure prediction accuracy. in addition to structure prediction, the thermodynamic methods can be applied to other problems. for example, antisense oligonucleotide and sirna design can be improved using thermodynamic predictions of self-structure in the oligonucleotides and target. sequences can be designed to fold to a specific structure. reverse-pcr primers can be designed to avoid self structure in the template that could prevent hybridization. novel types of ncrnas can be found in genomes on the basis of folding stability. in this contribution, the rnastructure software package is described. rnastructure first appeared in the literature in as a secondary structure prediction package. at that time, it contained a method to predict the lowest free energy structure and a set of low free energy structures. it was subsequently expanded to include bimolecular folding and hybridization thermodynamics with oligowalk. it was then expanded to include an algorithm for finding lowest free energy structures common to two sequences, dynalign; a partition function algorithm; an alternative prediction method that can determine all low free energy structures for a sequence; and stochastic sampling of structures. it provides methods for constraining structures with enzymatic data, chemical mapping data, shape, and nmr data. finally, recent extensions include parts, which calculates partition functions for secondary structures common to two sequences and can perform stochastic sampling of common structures; maxexpect, which finds maximum expected accuracy structures; and a method for removal of pseudoknots, leaving behind the lowest free energy pseudoknot-free structure. several tutorials exist for using rnastructure. rnastructure has been publicly available with a user-friendly interface for microsoft windows. testing and development occur in-house using unix/linux text-based interfaces, but these have generally been available only upon request. the package is coded in c++. extensive benchmarks of individual components have been published. here, three major extensions of rnastructure are reported. first, a new java-based graphical interface is available. this interface functions cross-platform and binaries are available for apple os-x and linux. second, text interfaces are now available for each component of the package. these interfaces use a standard unix syntax and include online help. binaries for the text interfaces are available for microsoft windows and source code, including makefiles, are available for download. finally, a new class library is available for programmers who want to incorporate the rnastructure functions into c++ programs. each of these components is available for download and covered by the gnu public license, version implementation c++ class library the c++ class library encapsulates the i/o functions of rnastructure and also the secondary structure prediction and analysis methods. four main classes are provided for accessing these functions: rna, for single sequence structure predictions; dynalign_object, for dynalign calculations; hybridrna, for bimolecular structure prediction; and oligowalk_object, for oligowalk and oligoscreen calculations. two other notable classes are utilized by inheritance by the four main classes. thermodynamics is a class that handles reading and storage of the nearest neighbor parameters. tworna is a class that contains two rna classes and is inherited by dynalign_object and instantiated by hybridrna. a class inheritance diagram is provided as figure the classes are designed to be easily included in c++ projects. the classes are compiled to linux/unix shared libraries, windows dynamic link libraries, or macintosh dynamic shared libraries. an included makefile provides facility for this. furthermore, the header files are commented using doxygen-formatted comments that facilitate the creation of a manual http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/. programmers can either compile their own manuals into html or latex using doxygen or they can refer to precompiled html manuals included in the source code and posted on the rnastructure website. text interfaces the new text interfaces are designed to provide the features of rnastructure for use on the command line and in scripts. most programs available in the graphical user interfaces are provided with text interfaces. each of these programs provides a brief description of the parameters when invoked without parameters. additionally, invoking most programs with ""-h,"" ""-h,"" or ""--help"" will return a more detailed description of the parameters. the text interfaces are built with ansi-standard c++. makefiles are included for compiling the programs in a unix/linux/os x environment. binaries for microsoft windows are also available for download. the rnastructure class library is used to implement most of the functions in the text interfaces. therefore, the text interfaces can be used as tutorials by programmers implementing the rnastructure algorithms in their own programs. java graphical user interface the new java gui is a cross-platform re-implementation of the rnastructure windows gui. this is designed to be user-friendly to make these algorithms accessible to a large audience. executables are available for apple os-x and both 32-bit and 64-bit linux. a makefile is provided to facilitate local compilation on unix/linux environments. the java gui utilizes the new rnastructure c++ class library to implement the algorithms. the connection between the java front end and the c++ back end is made using swig http://www.swig.org/. swig wraps the c++ classes, making them accessible to java. the swig-wrapped code is made available as part of the rnastructure code download, so that the java interface can be built on local machines that do not have swig installed. availability of algorithms maximum expected accuracy suboptimal function rna thermodynamic parameters the algorithms implemented in rnastructure use nearest neighbor parameters to predict the stability of secondary structures. these include both free energy change parameters at 37°c and enthalpy change parameters to allow prediction of conformation stability at an arbitrary temperature. for rna, these parameters are those most recent parameters from the turner group. for dna, the parameters are derived from the experimental literature. most algorithms for rna structure prediction can be invoked for dna structure prediction using the class, text interfaces, or guis. dna-rna hybridization parameters are also used by oligowalk. unit testing the rnastructure package now includes a facility for unit testing. a makefile automates testing of the text interfaces and comparison with calculation standards. the same tests can be used to test the guis, but this requires manual selection of the input. unit testing is helpful when changes are made to the algorithms to ensure that structure prediction is unchanged. unit testing is also important when rnastructure is installed in environments that have not been previously tested, to ensure that the installation worked correctly.  to demonstrate the utility of rnastructure, an example of secondary structure prediction is provided, showing the input and output. the method utilized is free energy minimization and the example sequence is the 5s rrna from pneumocystis carinii. after clicking ""start,"" the calculation proceeds and the structure is then drawn as shown in figure the lowest free energy structure is shown by default and the user can display other structures by selecting the ""draw"" menu item or by typing control-up-arrow or control-down-arrow. the same calculation could have been performed on the command line using the program ""fold."" the command line for the same default method is ""fold pcarinii.seq pcarinii.ct."" a set of postscript images of the predicted structure can then be rendered using ""draw pcarinii.ct pcarinii.ps."" behind the scenes, the structure prediction is performed using the rna class. for this example, the class was instantiated using a constructor that reads sequences: rna::rna. the integer indicates that the file is a sequence file and the bool true indicates that the sequence is rna. structure prediction is then accomplished using rna::foldsinglestrand, where the parameters that control suboptimal prediction are the max % energy difference, the max number of structures, and the window size, respectively, as appeared in the gui. the pairing can then be queried using rna::getpair or the drawing coordinates can be determined using rna::determinedrawcoordinates.  rnastructure is a software package for rna secondary structure prediction and analysis. it is designed to make algorithms accessible for a variety of user needs. user-friendly guis are available for windows, using native windows code, and for linux/unix and macintosh os-x using java. text interfaces are provided for performing calculations on the command line or for scripting. finally, a c++ class library is available to implement the algorithms into new programs. the package can be downloaded at http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/rnastructure.html.

"," to understand an rna sequence's mechanism of action, the structure must be known. furthermore, target rna structure is an important consideration in the design of small interfering rnas and antisense dna oligonucleotides. rna secondary structure prediction, using thermodynamics, can be used to develop hypotheses about the structure of an rna sequence.  rnastructure is a software package for rna secondary structure prediction and analysis. it uses thermodynamics and utilizes the most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the turner group. it includes methods for secondary structure prediction, prediction of base pair probabilities, bimolecular structure prediction, and prediction of a structure common to two sequences. this contribution describes new extensions to the package, including a library of c++ classes for incorporation into other programs, a user-friendly graphical user interface written in java, and new unix-style text interfaces. the original graphical user interface for microsoft windows is still maintained.  the extensions to rnastructure serve to make rna secondary structure prediction user-friendly. the package is available for download from the mathews lab homepage at http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/rnastructure.html.

111," human mitochondria contain multiple copies of a k bp, double-stranded, circular dna molecule. since mitochondria are the organelles that generate chemical energy for cellular functions, many disease symptoms are linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, including poor growth, muscle weakness, hearing problems, visual problems, heart diseases, and liver diseases. there were many recent studies which showed significantly reduced mitochondrial dna copy numbers in cell samples of aging-related diseases. a recent study also reported that mtdna copy number is associated with cancer risk. therefore, quantitative assessment of mtdna in human cells can elucidate the relationship between mitochondrial diseases and mitochondrial dysfunction. in the past decade, quantitative real-time pcr assays were developed to estimate relative levels of mtdna copy numbers in samples. this approach measures the mtdna copy number by determining the ratio of pcr amplicons to that of a single nuclear gene in experimental samples. the recent development of next-generation sequencing technology revolutionized genomic studies and produced accurate whole genome sequencing datasets. as shown in figure 1b, the output from human whole genome sequencing consists of both nuclear dna and mitochondrial dna molecules, thus it is convenient to assess mtdna copy number from wgs dataset and can be an alternative to real-time pcr assays. here we demonstrate a computational method for counting mtdna copy number using wgs datasets. the three steps in the process are typing of mtdna, separation of mtdna reads, and calculation of mtdna count. we developed a freely available software package called mitocounter for this purpose. mitocounter can be used to calculate the average copy numbers of mtdna molecules in the sequenced samples. besides, the separated mtdna reads provide further analysis of mtdna heteroplasmy. the mtdna heteroplasmy represents the mixture of individual mtdna mutations. heteroplasmy levels can alter the clinical penetrance of primary mtdna diseases. methods a computational assay for counting mtdna copies from a wgs dataset since the library construction bias is minimized with the next-generation sequencing platform, both mitochondrial dna and nuclear dna are sequenced together with equal opportunities. the output dataset comprises a mixture of mtdna reads and nudna reads. let the total number of nucleotide bases in the nuclear genome be 2n and the number of bases in a mitochondrial dna is m. then the summation of nucleotide bases in the entire human genome is 2n+km, where k is the number of mtdna copies. the numbers of reads from nudna and the number of reads from mtdna should reflect the ratio of 2n:km. that is, mtbasesallbases=km2n+km where mtbases is the total bases of sequenced reads from mtdna and allbases is total bases of all sequenced reads from the output of a wgs procedure. from an entire dataset of human whole genome sequencing, we separate the mtdna reads from the others. then the number of mtdna copies can be approximated as k=mtbases*2n*m the equation for counting mtdna copies is not suitable for plants since their mtdna sequences may contain segments of nuclear dna. besides, there are usually other dna molecules in their cells, such as chloroplast genome and plasmid genome. software implementation in order to precisely separate mtdna reads from a wgs dataset, it is necessary to determine the genotype of the mitochondrial genome first. we designed a program wgsmitoassembler to identify the homoplasmic sequences, which present the inherent mutations in most of mtdna molecules. the program wgsmitoassembler is a guided assembler, and it requires a reference mitochondrial sequence which is used to choose a beginning read and an ending read from the entire wgs dataset. we use the reference mtdna sequence for the purpose. we then search for best candidate reads which can extend the beginning read from the 3' end to the 5' end until the ending read is met. after the typing of the target mitochondrial genome, the homoplasmy sequence is used in the second program wgsmitocounter. the program performs the job of separating mitochondrial reads from the entire wgs dataset. considering that some of sequenced reads may contain erroneous bases, we design an error-tolerant mapping algorithm shown in figure we search for sub-sequences of paired reads which are indexed as mtdna fragments and the accuracy of mapping is determined by the pairing distances. wgsmitocounter will output a csv file which records the number of mitochondrial reads in each run of the entire dataset. the template of final calculation for mtdna copy number is provided in additional file  parental mtdna samples have less copy numbers we apply the analysis to public wgs datasets from the hapmap and genomes projects. we chose six high-coverage wgs datasets for two pedigree trios: yor and ceph and two low-coverage wgs datasets for individual elders, listed in table yor is an african family. ceph is a family from utah with northern and western european ancestry. the two individuals are also from the ceph population and were recorded as the grandparents in the genomes project. these dna samples were isolated from b-lymphocyte cells derived from blood. table lists the results of counting mitochondrial dna on the selected datasets. the mtdna counts for the yor family are between 645~ and for ceph family are between 734~ besides, the mtdna counts for the two individual elders are and * the references for haplogroup are selected from top blast results. for the counting results of these wgs samples, anova analysis revealed significant differences among the mtdna counts within each family group: for yor f =, p = e- and for ceph f =, p = e- it showed that the offspring had 8%~23% more mtdna than their parents in these samples. although we did not investigate the possible artefacts caused by sequencing procedures, the results consistently demonstrated that there are more mtdna sequences within younger persons' lymphocyte cells.  many studies suggested that mitochondrial functions become defective as we age. recent findings suggests that structural changes in mitochondria, including increased mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial fusion, are critical factors associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. therefore, the proposed quantitative analysis of mtdna can help to further elucidate the dynamics of mitochondrial diseases. it is expected that cost for sequencing personal whole genome will be less than $ in the near future. for the purpose of counting mitochondrial dna, it only requires a low coverage of the whole genome and the cost may be further reduced to $ the cost-effectiveness of the procedure makes the proposed method of counting mitochondrial dna as a useful diagnostic tool to study aging and aging-related diseases for individuals. availability and requirements in the mitocounter software package, both the programs

cells may therefore be a potential biomarker for diagnostics of aging. here we propose a new computational method for the accurate assessment of mtdna copies from whole genome sequencing data.  two families of the human whole genome sequencing datasets from the hapmap and the genomes projects were used for the accurate counting of mitochondrial dna copy numbers. the results revealed the parental mitochondrial dna copy numbers are significantly lower than that of their children in these samples. there are 8%~21% more copies of mtdna in samples from the children than from their parents. the experiment demonstrated the possible correlations between the quantity of mitochondrial dna and aging-related diseases.  since the next-generation sequencing technology strives to deliver affordable and non-biased sequencing results, accurate assessment of mtdna copy numbers can be achieved effectively from the output of whole genome sequencing. we implemented the method as a software package

112," rem sleep is characterised by rapid eye movements, a mixed frequency, low amplitude eeg, and a low submental muscle tone with phasic twitches. at the transition from non-rem sleep to rems these three features do not appear synchronously. the emg level may decrease prior to the occurrence of the two other markers, and may also persist for some time after the end of rems. nrems with low muscle tone was observed not only before and after rems but also at sleep onset in a selective rems deprivation study. nlmt was enhanced by total sleep deprivation and selective rems deprivation. it was proposed that epochs of nlmt could be correlates of rems and therefore serve as markers of rems regulation. the aim of the present study was to further investigate the relationship between nlmt and rems by analysing the first h of a 4-h nocturnal sleep episode and a subsequent 3-h daytime sleep episode.  rems latency and sorems episodes rems latency showed a unimodal distribution with a maximum at min during night sleep and a bimodal distribution with modes at and min and a trough at min during morning sleep. one single sleep onset rems episode occurred at night, while a total of sorems episodes were observed during morning sleep. at night, rems latencies ranged from to minutes. the four longest latencies were from a single individual with a'skipped' first rems episode in all four nights. in the morning, rems latencies ranged from to minutes. the duration of nrems episodes following a sorems episode ranged from to min; this range is comparable to that of rems latencies at night. seven of subjects showed sorems episodes in all four morning sleep episodes, one subject in three, three in two and three in one episode. only two subjects had no sorems episode. episodes of nlmt epochs of nrems with low muscle tone are illustrated for one subject. the latency to the first appearance of nlmt showed a bimodal distribution with modes at and min in night sleep. the first mode was centred at sleep onset and the second mode was situated in the proximity of rems onset. the distribution closely resembled the distribution of rems latencies in morning sleep. a unimodal distribution with a mode at min was observed in morning sleep. epochs of nlmt were more frequent in morning sleep than in the first hours of night sleep. in night sleep, episodes of nlmt at sleep onset were observed. the one subject with four'skipped' first rems episodes at night showed neither sorems episodes nor episodes of nlmt at sleep onset. the other subject without sorems episodes had no episode of nlmt at sleep onset at night but three in the morning. in of the morning sleep episodes without sorems, episodes of nlmt at sleep onset were observed. their length was similar in night and morning sleep. slow wave activity the mean time course of swa during night and morning sleep is plotted in fig. mean swa in the first nrems episode of morning sleep was lower than in the first nrems episode of night sleep. slow-wave energy of the first nrems episode was also lower in the morning than at night. simulations of process s were performed to test whether the changes in swa were in accordance with the two-process model of sleep regulation. process s represents the homeostatic process of sleep regulation. its time course was derived from eeg swa. the simulations were based on a regular sleep-wake schedule followed by a h sleep episode at night and a h daytime sleep episode. the time constants corresponded to those used in daan et al.. the simulations revealed a reduced level of s at sleep onset in the morning compared with the level at sleep onset at night. for night sleep, a close correspondence between empirical swa and the simulated level of s was observed. in the first nrems episode of morning sleep, however, the predicted level of s was above the empirical values. sleep variables derived from visual scoring waking after sleep onset, the duration and percentage of rems and stage were higher in the morning than at night, whereas the amount of stages and was lower. sleep latency was shorter in the morning than at night, whereas rems latency did not differ if sorems was excluded. total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and movement time did not differ between night and morning sleep episodes. cycle and episode duration sleep cycle duration did not differ between night and morning sleep. rems episodes, however, were longer and nrems episodes shorter in morning sleep than in night sleep. discussion episodes of nlmt the present study aimed at clarifying the relationship between a particular feature of nrems, nlmt, and rems regulation by analysing restricted nocturnal sleep and subsequent daytime sleep. the results provide evidence that nlmt is determined by rems propensity. nlmt occurred more frequently in morning sleep than in night sleep. in morning sleep, the latency to the first epoch of nlmt showed a unimodal distribution. in night sleep, a bimodal pattern prevailed with modes at sleep onset and in the proximity of rems onset. this distribution corresponds to that of rems latency in morning sleep. it is also similar to the pattern that had been observed in a selective rems deprivation protocol. the duration of the episodes of nlmt at sleep onset was slightly longer than the duration of sorems episodes and their latency was shorter. low muscle tone usually precedes and outlasts rems. from these results, we conclude that nlmt may represent a window for sorems. if the episodes of nlmt at sleep onset would just represent the normal wake-sleep transition then muscle tone would be expected to gradually decrease. as illustrated in figure both decrease and increase of muscle activity at sleep onset were typically rather sudden. no specific eeg markers were found to accompany episodes of nlmt as revealed by gross visual inspection. when nrems and rems were considered together, 86% of the morning sleep episodes, but only 37% of the night sleep episodes started with low muscle tone. in morning sleep both the circadian drive and the reduced nrems pressure contributed to a high rems propensity. low muscle tone may be considered a rems marker irrespective of the manifestation of this sleep state and epochs of low muscle tone at sleep onset may reflect the early appearance of rems. if the drive for rems is low, nlmt may be the only manifestation of this sleep state. nlmt may therefore be regarded as a facet of rems regulation as previously proposed. in that study, selective rems deprivation increased nlmt in recovery sleep and nlmt was higher in daytime sleep than in the baseline night. in our study, the number of episodes of nlmt increased, in parallel to sorems and rems, in morning sleep compared to night sleep. the present findings challenge the concept of discrete states and favours the concept of interleaved states. our hypothesis could, for instance, further be tested in a forced desynchrony protocol that allows to separate homeostatic and circadian components. low muscle tone is required to score rems. when speaking of muscle tone or emg, sleep researchers usually refer to recordings of submental or mental muscle activity, which has a state-specific tone. one has to keep in mind that the muscle tone of trunk and limb muscles shows a different pattern than the muscle tone of head and neck muscles: the reduced tonic level during sleep remains rather stable throughout the night without further decrease in rems. cells in the medial brainstem reticular formation are thought to control motor movement. they are active during waking and rems while during nrems their activity is reduced. during rems motoneurons in the brainstem are tonically inhibited although central motor systems are highly active. motoneuron hyperpolarisation and ensuing loss of muscle tone are due to a combination of disfacilitation and inhibition by the co-ordinated action of gaba and glycine release onto the motoneurons and concomitant decrease of norepinephrine and serotonin release onto them. if our assumption is correct, then the activity of the motoneurons during episodes of nlmt should show a similar pattern as seen during rems. sorems the high number of sorems episodes in morning sleep showed that this phenomenon is common in experimental protocols and illustrates that there may indeed be a rems window at sleep onset. sorems episodes and increased amounts of rems were reported for subjects sleeping in the morning after a night with or without sleep. in a time-free environment and in a forced desynchrony protocol, sorems occurred at a circadian phase corresponding to morning sleep. their number decreased in naps scheduled throughout daytime hours. after spontaneous wakefulness in a long scotoperiod protocol, sorems episodes were more frequent in the early morning hours. not only circadian factors but also nrems pressure influences sorems propensity. thus sleep initiated at 7: h after total sleep deprivation did not result in increased rems. in the present study, sorems and rems were enhanced in morning sleep by the high circadian drive and the reduced nrems propensity. the preceding restricted nocturnal sleep episode not only reduced nrems propensity but also induced a partial rems deprivation, as a large portion of rems occurs in the second half of the night. the shorter sleep latency in the morning than at night may be due to the increased rems propensity. slow wave activity simulations with the two-process model of sleep regulation revealed a close correspondence between empirical swa and the level of s for night sleep. however, the empirical values of swa were below the predicted level of s in the first nrems episode of morning sleep. this discrepancy between the data and the model is in accordance with findings of beersma and co-workers who reported reduced intensity of nrems under conditions of increased rems pressure. as already discussed, the 4-h sleep episode in the previous night decreased nrems pressure, which did not increase again up to the level of night sleep because the time between the night and the morning sleep episode was too short. concomitantly, the sleep restriction and the circadian phase increased rems pressure. thus, increased rems propensity appears to inhibit the full manifestation of swa in morning sleep. therefore not only a high nrems pressure impedes rems, but also high rems drive lowers nrems intensity. thus, swa represented in the model by process s is not just dependent on sleep-wake history, but additionally on the balance between nrems and rems pressure.  we conclude that nlmt is a marker of homeostatic and circadian rems regulation. at sleep onset, the epochs of low muscle tone represent an early manifestation of rems. reduced nrems pressure associated with enhanced homeostatic and circadian rems drive in the morning can account for the higher frequency of sorems episodes and epochs of nlmt in morning sleep than in night sleep. "," it was recently reported that epochs of non-rem sleep with low muscle tone represent a partial correlate of rem sleep. to further investigate this phenomenon, episodes of restricted night-time sleep and subsequent morning sleep were analysed.  epochs of nrems with low muscle tone were identified. their frequency was higher in morning sleep than in night sleep. at night, the latency to the first occurrence of nlmt showed a bimodal distribution with modes at sleep onset and close to rems onset. in morning sleep, the distribution was unimodal with the mode at sleep onset. an episode of nlmt at sleep onset occurred in % of the night sleep episodes and in % of the morning sleep episodes without sleep onset rems. also sorems occurred predominantly in morning sleep. rems episodes were longer and nrems episodes shorter in morning sleep than in night sleep, whereas cycle duration did not differ. simulating the time course of slow-wave activity revealed a close correspondence between empirical and computed values for night sleep, and some discrepancies for morning sleep.  the results provide further evidence that nrems with low muscle tone is a marker of rems regulation. nlmt at sleep onset may represent an early manifestation of rems.

113," as more and more genomes are sequenced and annotated, the capacity to accurately and efficiently catalog the gene expression profiles of these organisms is becoming ever more apparent. with techniques such as in situ hybridization, qrt-pcr, and more recently absolute quantitation being used to assess gene expression, there are still lingering issues of humble throughput and lack of massive parallel comparisons. array technology has improved these conditions yet problems of standardizing statistical analyses are lacking, along with observed differences when comparing microarray platforms, though others have found significant reproducibility. oligonucleotide arrays, for example, prove useful in not requiring cdna library production, whilst cdna microarray proves useful in cases of non-model organism and even been used to identify heterologous genes across multiple species. even so, the current microarray platforms are still several years behind the current state of knowledge of many organisms genome. furthermore, classifying a differentially regulated gene is a problem of both array types with research even suggesting it should be dealt with in a tiered approach. to assess the power of analysis, there are many different ways when it comes to expression data. the use of t-tests, anovas, gene ontology annotation, p-value cutoffs, bonferroni corrections, array normalization, fishers exact test, and fold change cut offs all lead towards a reduction in gene expression data which may inadvertently reduce or increase the power of analysis. we obtained a data set from a recently published paper and reanalyzed the raw data using multiple different approaches. from this data analysis, we hypothesized that by changing the significance level as well as the fold change cut off, more than one interpretation of the data can be obtained. subsequently, there is only one microarray study on heart tissue response to hypoxia published, implying a low value for replication and the possibility of perpetuation of error and to the accumulation of unreliable explanations and unverified findings. essentially the novelty of this study in light of marques et al. is for future studies to unravel which significance criteria is relevant, biological or statistical.  microarray technology has proven beneficial to directly identifying co-regulated genes, pathways, and systems allowing for a more informed snapshot of the transcriptome. as such, our results indicate that changes in the significance level of differential expressed gene products along with the fold change cut-offs can give very different results that imply different signaling pathways and functions involved. as t-tests have been widely used to identify deviation from the mean, large sampling sizes can influence the number of false positives and may infer little if anything about the biology. fold change on the other hand lends itself to a more biologically meaningful assessment yet still encounters problems with identifying what is significant to the organism. therefore using both criteria may help but not fix the problem of microarray analysis. within this study, the contributions of each differentially expressed gene criteria were evaluated. as indicated before, the criteria suggest different biological meaning. the number of significant genes were overwhelming at a p ≤ and even upon increasing to a p ≤ level, the data is reduced almost in half yet still remains massive for understanding the biological response to hypoxia. fold change suggests more meaningful insight to the organism throughout development and into adulthood with proving to be a better eliminator of background noise as there were fewer genes left after making a fold change cutoff of ≥ as compared to using significance cutoffs. as the fold change level increases to that of ≥ the number of genes significantly decreases. this suggests that biologically, less genes change drastically and that the significant difference observed at p ≤ and are related to a possible whole animal response to treatment. to understand the change and ultimately the importance in interpretation of genes influenced by chronic constant hypoxia, an intersection of ≥ fold change and p ≤ was compared to ≥ fold change and p ≤. the data obtained from our analysis indicates that there were more up-regulated genes as compared to down regulated, implying that even in a state of stress the organism is actively adjusting its transcriptome and, more specifically, the transcriptome of the heart. using the most stringent criteria, there were several genes that were up-regulated and observed in both intersection groups. hypoxia inducible factor was found to be up-regulated and is known to be expressed in response to hypoxic conditions. interestingly, chemokine ligand 12a stromal cell derived factor was only observed under ≥ fold change and p ≤ conditions. cxcl is involved in directing hematopoietic cells and angiogenesis. by omitting this chemokine from the biological interpretation, clinical researchers may overlook a corollary between tumor progression and ischemia, a state of desperate need for oxygen and nutrients. other genes such as bone morphogenetic protein 2a and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1a were observed in each selection criteria indicating they are significant and change more than two fold in response to chronic constant hypoxia. igfbp-1a has been known to be involved in regulating igf and insulin pathways which can be linked to cell proliferation and protection against cell death along with bmp- involved with bone development. those genes down- regulated at the most stringent selection criteria show similar reductions to those observed by marques et al. metabolically related genes, such as acyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, socs and creatine kinase indicate that a shift to oxygen independent metabolism is occurring. these genes are involved in fatty acid oxidation, pyruvate oxidation, cytokine signaling disruption, and the rapid shuttling of atp sources, respectively. interestingly, changes both at a metabolic level as well as at a synaptic level were observed as synaptotagmin, uncoupling protein and atpase, ca2+ transporting, cardiac muscle, fast-twitch like gene were found to be significantly down regulated indicating that mitochondrial membrane leak was reduced and calcium initiated cellular signaling may be attenuated in cardiac tissue. however, some genes not identified under the most stringent criteria and counter to ischemia/ reperfusion, are superoxide dismutase, heat shock protein and lactate dehydrogenase d. this suggests the response to chronic constant hypoxia may be tissue specific as these genes should be up-regulated under hypoxic conditions. sod has been found to be crucial in the breakdown of reactive oxygen species while hsp are used for stabilizing proteins under stressful conditions. other genes such as programmed cell death and ras association domain family were down regulated and differentially expressed but were not found under most stringent statistical criteria. both of these genes are involved in cellular processes important to the survival of the cell or its interaction with other cells, respectively. as zebrafish have developed ways to respond and survive under hypoxic conditions, aif- and ras may bring insight into cellular mechanisms responsible for cell survivability and cell rigidity. thus understanding the integrative response to chronic constant hypoxia is beginning to look more and more like the response observed in tumorigenesis, which may be overlooked based on selection criteria of genes. using fold enrichment analysis and fishers exact tests of all sets in comparison to originally published, we found that though our most stringent criteria was similar to marques et al, we had distinct changes in go annotation groups involved in microtubule activity, hydrolase activity, nucleic acid binding and carbohydrate binding. interestingly, reducing the criteria down to fc and p of, several different go groups were found to be significant especially those involved in structural integrity, ribosome structure, and transcription regulation and factors, suggesting these may not vary widely in expression but that there are more significant genes thus pointing towards the problems of microarray analysis. at one spectrum, novelty in research is revered whilst on the other hand replication and accuracy to natural phenomena may result in skewed explanations. we humbly feel the reanalysis of microarray data is necessary along with follow up gene expression studies to accurately explain biological phenomena.  our results point to the dangers of statistical selection criteria as well as shed light on genes crucial to understanding chronic constant hypoxia. as more genes are sequenced, microarray platform expanded, along with understanding the role of splice variants in zebrafish, a larger and more dynamic picture of the transcriptome can be gathered. in sum, we demonstrate how fold change and statistical cut-offs modulate the outcome of microarray data. future, studies should tie together previously unanalyzed genes such as leptin to microarray data in response to constant hypoxia in adult zebrafish. as the current microarray platform does not include them, problems still exist at the molecular level, influencing our understanding of the physiological and ultimately behavioural and ecological roles of these organisms. "," as context is important to gene expression, so is the preprocessing of microarray to transcriptomics. microarray data suffers from several normalization and significance problems. arbitrary fold change cut-offs of > and significance p-values of < lead data collection to look only at genes which vary wildly amongst other genes. therefore, questions arise as to whether the biology or the statistical cutoff are more important within the interpretation. in this paper, we reanalyzed a zebrafish microarray data set using genespring and different differential gene expression cut-offs and found the data interpretation was drastically different. furthermore, despite the advances in microarray technology, the array captures a large portion of genes known but yet still leaving large voids in the number of genes assayed, such as leptin a pleiotropic hormone directly related to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.  the data strongly suggests that the number of differentially expressed genes is more up-regulated than down-regulated, with many genes indicating conserved signalling to previously known functions. recapitulated data from marques et al. was similar but surprisingly different with some genes showing unexpected signalling which may be a product of tissue or that the intended response was transient.  our analyses suggest that based on the chosen statistical or fold change cut-off; microarray analysis can provide essentially more than one answer, implying data interpretation as more of an art than a science, with follow up gene expression studies a must. furthermore, gene chip annotation and development needs to maintain pace with not only new genomes being sequenced but also novel genes that are crucial to the overall gene chips interpretation. 2- may great lakes bioinformatics conference athens, oh, usa ",bf9c829d-fb19-4983-9068-04122467f74e,pubmed
114," quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr is an extremely sensitive technique that allows the precise measurement of gene expression across more than seven orders of magnitude. rt-pcr is often considered the gold standard for quantifying gene expression, and is commonly used to validate techniques with greater throughput but less overall sensitivity, such as microarray analysis. rt-pcr relies on the use of fluorescent dyes to quantify transcript amplification, with the amplification cycle number at which these dyes/transcripts are detected giving an indication as to the relative abundance of the target molecules. the sensitivity of rt-pcr makes it a powerful tool for gene expression measurement, especially when sample quantities are limited or a transcript is expressed at a low level. however, this sensitivity also means that a great deal of care must be taken with regards to experimental design and implementation of the procedure. when designing an experiment to evaluate gene expression in a group of samples, a number of critical factors must be kept constant. these include rna extraction, dnase treatments, and cdna synthesis. normalisation of rt-pcr results is required to control inter-sample differences that may arise as a result of these sample processing steps, and ensure the gene expression of target transcripts are robustly quantifiable. the most common method for normalising rt-pcr data involves the use of one or more endogenous control genes. an ideal endogenous control gene is one that is stably expressed within the samples to be compared, regardless of tissue differences, experimental conditions, or treatments. choosing an endogenous control gene to normalise gene expression data is one of the most crucial steps in the experimental design. genes used as endogenous controls in rt-pcr experiments are often chosen with little prior knowledge of their expression over the experimental conditions examined, and are often selected arbitrarily from a pool of commonly used endogenous control genes such as gapdh, and β-actin. the most widely used endogenous control gene in studies of endometrial gene expression is gapdh. however, the suitability of gapdh as an endogenous control gene has recently come into question, especially due to its potential regulation in a wide variety of physiological states, making it a questionable choice for rt-pcr normalisation. over the past three decades, genetic selection for milk production has resulted in a significant decline in dairy cattle fertility. the fertilisation rate in dairy cattle is around 90% and does not differ between low-moderate and high-producing animals. however, the calving rate in lower producing animals is approximately 55%, whereas in high-producing animals this rate is approximately 35%. pregnancy losses are thought to occur primarily during the pregnancy recognition/pre-implantation period, making studies of endometrial gene expression critical to further understanding of pregnancy establishment, recognition and maintenance within the bovine reproductive cycle. the primary aim of this study was to identify suitable endogenous control genes for analysis of endometrial tissues from pregnant and cycling bovines. this study also aimed to investigate the potential use of microarray data analysis for identification of novel endogenous control genes, and the effect of endogenous control gene selection on the calculated expression of a target gene. a total of candidate endogenous control genes were analysed in samples representing two different tissues from animals. these animals were either pregnant or cycling at day of the reproductive cycle, and represented holstein-friesian cows from two divergent genetic backgrounds, and new zealand ). two strategies were employed to identify the candidates. five genes were selected on the basis that they had been previously used as housekeeping genes, and an additional novel genes were derived from a microarray experiment based around the same samples used in the current analysis. genespring gx software was used to generate a list through filtering on expression stability across the samples. this list was subjected to genorm and normfinder analysis to identify the most suitable genes. the suitability of all genes was then tested through statistical analyses, including a comparison of expression stability as determined by genorm and normfinder algorithms. the effect of using these endogenous control genes was then evaluated using relative quantification of a gene known to be differentially expressed in the study.  microarray analysis of the endometrial samples revealed transcripts with a high degree of expression stability. genorm and normfinder were utilised to identify the most stably expressed transcripts for further analysis. for rt-pcr design, full length transcripts were identified by querying microarray probe sequences against the bovine genome using ncbi blast. gene expression levels of the candidate endogenous control genes are displayed in table and figure cq values for sample replicates had very low variability with a mean intra-assay coefficient of variation of %. all genes had low overall variability, with the cq range between and cycles, standard deviations ranging from to cycles, and cv values ranging from to % table significance calculations between gene expression data for pregnant and cycling animals were performed on cq and relative concentration values, as estimated through absolute quantification using the roche lc software. no significant differences in means or variances between pregnant and cycling endometrial tissues were apparent for any candidate genes for variance between pregnant and cycling animals). the means and variances between the two different strains of holstein-friesians also lacked significance. cqs and relative concentration variances between the two different tissue types showed no significant differences, however means were significantly different for all genes, except rps15a, p = ). the differences in means calculated between tissue subtypes likely reflect the distinct morphological and functional differences between caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium, which relate to their respective roles in reproduction. the'caruncules' of the endometrium are specialised projections that are the site of embryo attachment. caruncules become highly vascularised, and are the major site for small molecule and gaseous exchange. in comparison, intercaruncular tissue is highly glandular and responsible for early nourishment of the embryo through secretions of large molecules into the uterus. the intercaruncular tissue is often thought to be more important in early pregnancy and, therefore, the majority of expression studies in pre-implantation bovine endometrium focus solely on intercaruncular tissue gene expression. there is very little reported expression analysis of caruncular endometrium and no known studies comparing expression profiles of the two tissues. expression stability testing of candidate genes to further analyse the suitability of the candidate genes for use as endogenous controls for bovine endometrial tissues, expression stability was assessed using the genorm and normfinder algorithms. genorm rankings for the genes tested are presented in table and figure 2a. genorm identified suz and znf as the most stably expressed genes of the candidates. four of the five most stable genes were those derived from microarray data; the other was rps15a, which was selected from the literature. by contrast, four of the five least stable genes were chosen from the literature, including gapdh. the most stably expressed gene identified by normfinder was suz, which was also one of the two most stable genes identified in the genorm analysis. the best combination of genes identified by normfinder was suz and c2orf the five most stably expressed genes according to normfinder consisted entirely of microarray-derived genes, while the least stable five contained three out of five genes selected from the literature, again including gapdh. the comparative ranking of all genes for both genorm and normfinder algorithm analyses is displayed in table normfinder rankings of genes through analysis of inter- and intra group variability. genorm rankings of genes based on pairwise analysis of expression stability. genorm calculates an expression stability value for each candidate gene based on pairwise comparisons of variability. each gene is compared to every other gene to determine the two genes that contain the least variation. the stability value calculated for each gene is used to rank genes from least to most stable. the authors of the method give an m-value of as a cut-off for suitability as an endogenous control gene. the principal behind the pairwise stability measure ranking is that two ideal candidate normalisation genes should have an equal expression ratio in all samples. in the present study, all genes are well below the stipulated m-value. the program then calculates a normalisation factor in each sample for the most stable genes. genorm also calculates the optimal number of endogenous control genes to be used in the analysis of gene expression. this value is determined by locating the point where addition of the next most stable gene does not significantly affect the normalisation factor, using a cut-off value of. in this study, the value for genes was, suggesting that genes should be sufficient to normalise the experimental data. genorm calculates the minimum number of genes required for accurate normalisation. in this case, two genes were sufficient. the number of genes necessary for accurate normalisation is defined as the point at which the addition of a gene has a non-significant effect on the calculation of the normalisation factor, the threshold for a non-significant difference being. normfinder is another freely available tool for the identification of stable endogenous control genes. the main point of difference between the two methods is that normfinder takes into account both inter- and intra-group variability. the program not only identifies the most stable pair of endogenous control genes but also identifies the best overall endogenous control gene. the calculation of variability between groups is especially important in the present study considering the significant expression differences between the two tissue subtypes. the use of the two most stably expressed genes, in this case suz and c2orf, should provide sufficient normalisation for tissue comparisons as normfinder selects the best combination of genes whilst taking into account any grouping effects such as tissue type. the differences in rankings of gene stability using the two algorithms could be due to the fact that they use very different methods to assess gene stability. genorm selects genes based on the pairwise variation between genes. the two most stably expressed genes are therefore those genes that share an expression profile. in contrast, normfinder uses a model based algorithm that takes into account overall stability as well as any groups that may be present in the sample set. for example, if there are any grouping effects on gene expression a gene would be ranked lower than one that demonstrated variability not associated with any particular group. effect of endogenous control gene on target gene relative quantification temporal down-regulation of endometrial oxytocin receptor expression is a hallmark of early pregnancy, with embryonic interferon tau thought to elicit this response. given the expectation of differential oxtr expression between pregnant and cycling animals, the effect of control gene stability on gene expression values of oxtr in the endometrial samples was tested. oxtr expression was significantly greater in cycling than in pregnant cows regardless of the endogenous control gene used. notably, oxtr expression in pregnant animals was greater on average and more variable in na animals than for nz animals, and was also related to embryo size. the use of different endogenous control genes had no effect on oxtr expression differences in these group comparisons. however, there were differences in the normalised oxtr expression values that were inconsistent across the samples, depending on which endogenous control genes were employed. for example, in sample pregnant nz-5a the calculated relative oxtr expression value was when normalised to suz when normalised to gapdh, when normalised to uxt, and when normalised to both suz and znf another sample, the values were,,, and when normalised to suz gapdh, uxt and both suz and znf respectively. the average calculated fold change difference between pregnant and cycling animals was not affected by the choice of normalisation gene, possibly due to the large difference in expression level for this comparison. however, the choice of reference gene could be important when normalising genes that exhibit more subtle variation between experimental groups, given the considerable variation in expression shown between individual samples.  this study provides the first reported assessment of endogenous control genes for use in expression studies in bovine endometrium. normalisation is a critical factor in reporting rt-pcr expression data, providing a necessary control for error associated with sample preparation. normalisation using endogenous control genes provides a means of controlling this error, provided the gene used are stably expressed across all samples under investigation. the study described here tested candidate reference genes across bovine endometrial samples representing a range of physiological states and tissue subtypes. this study evaluated the suitability of both commonly used and novel experimentally derived reference genes for use in normalisation of rt-pcr data. candidates derived via microarray analysis were superior to existing, commonly used endogenous control genes, demonstrating the suitability of using microarray data for deriving novel endogenous control genes. this study also highlighted the importance of accurate normalisation with a stable endogenous control gene, by demonstrating relative expression of a differentially expressed gene when normalised using control genes of varying stability. suz was ranked first for stability across samples as determined by the statistical algorithms used in genorm and normfinder, and is therefore proposed as the best gene for normalisation of rt-pcr data in the current study. "," quantitative real-time pcr gene expression results are generally normalised using endogenous control genes. these reference genes should be expressed at a constant level across all sample groups in a study, and should not be influenced by study treatments or conditions. there has been no systematic investigation of endogenous control genes for bovine endometrium to date. the suitability of both commonly used and novel endogenous control genes was evaluated in this study, with the latter being selected from stably expressed transcripts identified through microarray analysis of bovine endometrium. fifteen candidate endogenous control genes were assessed across different tissue subtypes in pregnant and cycling holstein-friesian dairy cows from two divergent genetic backgrounds.  the expression profiles of five commonly used endogenous control genes and experimentally derived candidate endogenous control genes were analysed across samples to determine the most stably expressed gene. gene stability was assessed using the statistical algorithms genorm and normfinder. all genes presented with low overall variability. however, when used to normalise a differentially expressed gene in the samples, the reported relative gene expression levels were significantly affected by the control gene chosen. based on the results of this analysis, suz is proposed as the most appropriate control gene for use in bovine endometrium during early pregnancy or the oestrus cycle.  this study establishes the suitability of novel endogenous control genes for comparing expression levels in endometrial tissues of pregnant and cycling bovines, and demonstrates the utility of microarray analysis as a method for identifying endogenous control gene candidates.

115," real-time quantitative pcr has become a very powerful tool for gene expression studies. one of the main difficulties associated with this highly sensitive technique is the necessity of accurate normalization, to account for varying amounts of cdna input. this variation is inherent to the multistep process required to extract and process the rna. the use of internal controls or reference genes has become the method of choice to account for this source of variation. the choice of an appropriate internal standard is therefore critical for relative gene expression analysis in order to obtain consistent and reliable results, especially when measuring small expression differences. a suitable reference gene to which expression can be normalized should have constant expression in all samples under investigation and should be insensitive to varying experimental treatments. although the nematode c. elegans is a commonly used model organism that has proven its importance in the unraveling of many important signaling pathways, to date no comprehensive analysis has been performed to validate candidate reference genes for gene expression analysis. therefore, commonly used reference genes such as act- and ama- are often used without validating their usefulness. however, several reports indicate that the expression of commonly used reference genes can vary under different experimental conditions, possibly leading to dramatic misinterpretation of the expression level of a target gene. although there is no universally accepted approach for data normalization, the method of using multiple stably expressed reference genes is currently the golden standard. the straightforward method developed by vandesompele and colleagues to identify the most stably expressed reference genes from a set of candidate control genes can be used to normalize gene expression levels. their method also allows the determination of the optimal number of genes required for reliable normalization of qpcr generated gene expression data. they advocate use of the geometric mean of multiple stably expressed reference genes for normalization of relative quantities. this approach has been widely implemented by many researchers and has been statistically validated by szabo et al. and by the bootstrap procedure of gabrielsson et al., but surprisingly seems to be neglected in the c. elegans research field. the ins/igf- signaling pathway is a well-known life span regulator in c. elegans, drosophila and mice. a reduced activity of the pathway in c. elegans leads to nuclear localization of the transcription factor daf- causing dauer formation and extended adult life span. long-lived iis mutants are highly resistant to a wide diversity of stressors, including enhanced survival upon exposure to the superoxide generator paraquat. given the potential role of reactive oxygen species in the ageing process, it is assumed that enzymes involved in the breakdown of ros play an important role in the longevity phenotype of dauers and long-lived iis mutants. five different genes encoding superoxide dismutase have been predicted in c. elegans. sod- and sod- encode cytosolic cuznsods. sod- expresses two splice variants, one membrane bound and one secreted. sod- and sod- encode mitochondrial mnsods. it is well-established that increased life span is often associated with increased stress resistance and high antioxidant activity. for example, the long life span of dauers and iis mutants is associated with increased stress resistance and high sod activity. northern blot and microarray analysis have shown that sod- and possibly also sod- are upregulated in dauers and daf- mutants. we demonstrate the usefulness of genorm to determine the expression levels of the sod genes in c. elegans. genorm analysis evaluates the stability of candidate reference genes based on the mean pairwise variation of a gene with all other tested genes. we compared the expression level of the candidate reference genes in different c. elegans samples to validate internal controls for the analysis of sod gene expression. the presented approach can be applied to accurately normalize the expression of any c. elegans gene of interest.  we carefully selected potential reference genes from different functional classes to minimize the chance of coregulation using two different approaches. first we selected commonly used reference genes such as ama-, act-, eif- c, gpd- and tba-. in a second approach we screened publicly available c. elegans microarray expression data. in this procedure we ranked all genes according to their standard deviation in experiments and chose potential reference genes within the top ranked ones based on the following three criteria: functional description available, expression data available for at least experiments and cdna confirmed. this strategy resulted in cdc- pmp- rgs- unc- and y45f10d. as candidate reference genes. after initial screening, we found that two genes from the available expression data in kim et al. were expressed at very low levels and therefore excluded for further analysis. in an attempt to validate the remaining candidate reference genes as internal control for analysis of sod gene expression in c. elegans, we set up an experiment containing young adult wild-type, three strains carrying mutations in the ins/igf pathway, wild type dauer worms and wild-type l stage larvae. data were collected using rna from replicate c. elegans cultures. since the reverse transcription step is the source of most of the variability in quantitative pcr, cdna synthesis was performed in duplicate from each of the three different biological replicates and pooled to use as template in the pcr experiments. for every primer pair concentrations were optimized in a range between nm and nm, based on a standard curve made with dilution series of a mixture of all cdna templates. these standard curves produced efficiencies between and with standard deviations ranging from to and correlation coefficients greater than, as determined by qbase. three identical real-time qpcr experiments were performed. in each experiment, the expression levels of the candidate reference genes and sod genes were measured in duplicate in different worm samples. the candidate control genes display a wide expression range with mean cycle threshold values between and. to identify the most stable reference genes we applied the genorm program. the ranking of the candidate reference genes according to their stability measure value in every biological replicate is displayed in table this gene expression stability measure m is the mean pairwise variation between a candidate reference gene and all other tested candidates. a higher value of m means greater variation in expression. the stepwise elimination of genes with the highest m values allows the ranking of the tested genes according to their expression stability. interestingly, in the three biological repeat experiments cdc- and pmp- turned out to be among the three best performing reference genes. moreover, in each of the three biological repeats the ranking of the least stable genes included mdh- act- and gpd- the consistent ranking of the best and worst reference genes illustrates the excellent correspondence and reproducibility between the independently grown nematode cultures. pairwise variations vn/n+ between each combination of sequential normalization factors were calculated by genorm to determine the optimal number of reference genes required for accurate normalization. based on the recommendations by vandesompele et al. we used a cut-off value of, below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene does not result in a significant improvement of normalization. following this criterion the inclusion of a third reference gene is required for assay set but not for analyzing replicate sets and. for consistency reasons we prefer to use the most stably expressed genes for all replicate assays. to demonstrate the need for accurate relative quantification using suitable reference genes, the expression of the sod genes was studied. in each of the three assays a normalization factor based on the geometric mean of cdc- pmp- and y45f10d. expression level was used to determine the relative expression level of all sod genes. the average normalised sod mrna values and the 95% confidence intervals are shown in figure the 95% confidence intervals clearly illustrate that sod- and sod- are significantly upregulated in daf- relative to n in agreement with microarray studies of mcelwee et al. and murphy et al.. in dauers, sod- is significantly downregulated relative to l sod- is significantly upregulated relative to l and sod- and sod- are significantly upregulated relative to both l and n we illustrate that normalization to a single reference gene without appropriate validation can lead to erroneous results by normalizing sod- to act- gpd- and mdh- respectively. when normalized only to act- the expression level of sod- in daf- differs by more than % and is not found to be significantly upregulated. moreover the expression level of sod- in the dauer is upregulated instead of downregulated relative to l this shows that act- is unsuitable as a reference gene. when using mdh- only a modest, but not significant, increase by 2-fold in daf- could be seen, and the expression level of sod- appears to be strongly upregulated in dauers. moreover, if gpd- or ama- had been used, no significant differential expression would have been detected in daf- mutants or dauers. discussion an ideal reference gene is expressed at the same level in all cell types and under all experimental conditions. numerous publications demonstrate that no single gene is able to fulfill these criteria. to reliably measure small expression differences, normalization using stably expressed reference genes is of crucial importance. this forced us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of different potential reference genes in different c. elegans samples, including distinct developmental stages of the wild-type and adults of ins/igf pathway mutants. we here provide validated assays for a newly developed set of multiple candidate reference genes. the genorm analysis revealed that cdc- and pmp- are among the best performing reference genes identified in each of biological replicates. they were picked up from a microarray screen of differentially regulated genes underscoring the reliability of this strategy to identify new candidate reference genes. they are far more stably expressed than conventional reference genes, at least in this study. since in all biological repeats addition of a fourth reference gene did not substantially improve the newly calculated normalization factor, there was no need to include more reference genes. therefore we recommend to use three reference genes since we generally found that this number allows reliable and accurate quantification with a minimal effort. our analysis showed that mdh- is the least stable reference gene, which is in concordance with a previously published paper of mcelwee et al. who demonstrated by microarray analysis that mdh- was downregulated in dauers. similarly, mendenhall et al. have recently shown that gpd- was upregulated in daf- worms. both studies suggest that gpd- and mdh- are downstream genes of daf- as expected, genorm ranked these genes as the two least stable reference genes in two of the three biological repeats. interestingly, the most commonly used reference gene act- is one of the least stable reference genes as indicated by the genorm analysis. we used the reference genes to reveal the expression levels of sod-genes in long-lived ins/igf mutants and dauers. our results largely confirm and extend previous studies using norhern blots, sage and microarray analysis. the increased expression of sod- in dauers and daf- mutants has been well documented,. elevated expression of sod- in dauers was reported by jones et al.. we also detected an increased expression of sod- in daf- mutants which is in accordance with the increased activity of cytosolic sod in long-lived ins/igf- pathway mutants given that sod- appears to be the most active cuznsod.  this study demonstrates the importance of appropriate validation of internal reference genes chosen for gene expression analysis using real-time qpcr. we show that candidate reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression levels in c. elegans can be identified from publicly available microarray databases. the methodology used in the present study enables accurate analysis of differential gene expression of any set of candidate genes. "," in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the conserved ins/igf- signaling pathway regulates many biological processes including life span, stress response, dauer diapause and metabolism. detection of differentially expressed genes may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism by which the ins/igf- signaling pathway regulates these processes. appropriate normalization is an essential prerequisite for obtaining accurate and reproducible quantification of gene expression levels. the aim of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for gene expression analysis in c. elegans.  real-time quantitative pcr was used to evaluate the expression stability of candidate reference genes in wild-type, three ins/igf- pathway mutants, dauers and l stage larvae. after genorm analysis, cdc- pmp- and y45f10d. showed the most stable expression pattern and were used to normalize sod expression levels. significant differences in mrna levels were observed for sod- and sod- in daf- relative to wild-type animals, whereas in dauers sod- sod- sod- and sod- are differentially expressed relative to third stage larvae.  our findings emphasize the importance of accurate normalization using stably expressed reference genes. the methodology used in this study is generally applicable to reliably quantify gene expression levels in the nematode c. elegans using quantitative pcr.

116," it is now a common belief that single nucleotide variations in the human genome are responsible for influencing traits such as differences in drug metabolism and disease risk. these variations are referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms and several large-scale technologies have recently been developed for scoring of thousands of snps and approaching whole-genome genotyping. however, for smaller scale projects where potential genes are already known, technologies for genotyping of many samples instead of snps and in addition retain high accuracy and throughput, are more attractive compared to assays that are cost effective per snp. a flexible choice of snps is also important instead of a pre-defined set of snps. there are several technologies already used in academic contexts but the earliest paralleled assays relied upon hybridization of short allele-specific probes to the target dna. however, improvements in microarray-based technologies in terms of accuracy have been achieved by enzymatic means. one of these technologies involves allele-specific extension which utilizes the ability of dna polymerase to distinguish matched and mismatched 3'-termini of primers. however, a number of reports have shown that some mismatched 3'-ends can be elongated, giving false positive signals. nevertheless, as previously described, by exploiting the fact that the mismatched primers have slower reaction kinetics, the problems associated with ase can be circumvented by including a protease that degrades the polymerase. in the protease-mediated allele-specific extension, the protease constrains the elongation reaction and thus prevents incorrect nucleotide incorporation to mismatched 3'-termini primers. in this work, an automated prase assay with a tag-microarray detection system has been used and a comprehensive comparison of genotyping results with pyrosequencing has been done. ten polymorphic positions previously studied with pyrosequencing for their suggested association as prothrombotic genetic variations were used. these were analyzed on genomic dna from unrelated dna samples of caucasian/scandinavian origin from a cohort of patients presenting with symptoms of acute chest pain. a total of genotypes were scored by each method and accordingly this study offers a thorough characterization of a microarray-based technique in terms of accuracy, robustness and variability.  the prase assay employed for parallel genotyping of snps is outlined in figure with some minor modifications to the original protocol, see methods for details. extracted genomic dna is amplified in a nested pcr to achieve high specificity as well as to avoid extensive optimization of the multiplex amplification. amplicons of minimal and similar sizes were chosen for the inner pcr to minimize the amount of pcr optimizations. the amplification products are immobilized on magnetic beads via biotin-streptavidin binding. by using a solid phase reaction, full automation of genotyping reactions in parallel could be facilitated with a magnet-equipped pipetting robot. the washes of the robot tips were now optimized to keep contaminations between sample rows undetectable. the genotyping protocol takes approximately hands-off hours and minutes of hands-on. this was followed by a one hour microarray detection of the samples on one standard slide. in brief, after pcr product immobilization and clean-ups, the allele-specific extension primers are hybridized to ssdna and the multiplex prase reaction is carried out by use of cy labeled dntps, allowing fluorescence detection. the products of the prase reaction are then hybridized to a tag-microarray via unique tag-sequences included in the extension primers. the generic signature tag-arrays allow the genotyping results for the snps to be separated into different spots. a custom made silicone rubber mask was used to divide each slide into identical wells, facilitating analysis of samples in parallel. the fluorescence signals for each pair of allele-specific primers were counted with an image analysis software. a script automatically visualizes the results as cluster diagrams for each snp and genotypes the samples by calculating allelic fractions. afs are set to be the intensity from allele divided by the sum of intensities from both alleles. the afs are then plotted for each snp against the logarithm of the sum of both signals. an example of a raw data image of an entire slide and the corresponding cluster diagrams for the samples on the slide is shown in figure the boundaries for the individual clusters are set as ± sd from the mean af within each cluster. this control was used to increase stringency and thus data points that fall outside clusters are classified as ""no call"". to investigate the variability between tag sequences, each allele-specific extension primer was designed with two alternative tag sequences. the cluster diagrams for each of the primer pair combinations were compared and all combinations gave similar clusters as compared to the diagrams presented in figure indicating that the cluster distributions were mainly related to the extension rather than the hybridization properties of the tag sequence. however, for itgb the clusters were shifted towards the left but functional when using one of the primer pairs. this can be due to either differences in hybridization efficiency or failure in the primer synthesis. in addition, in order to investigate the effect of protease on genotyping calls, eight samples were genotyped in the presence and absence of protease. without protease, correct clustering could be obtained for out of the snps whereas with protease correct clustering was obtained for all snps. the snps that did not render distinguishable clusters by ase are located in the itgb and fgb genes. in these cases, the mismatch primer was mistakenly extended for one of the homozygous types, making these samples appear as heterozygotes. the pyrosequencing assay was employed on these snps, confirming the prase results. in addition, in the remaining snps, the inclusion of protease renders complete partitioning of the clusters by increasing the distance between clusters, indicating the higher robustness of prase. these findings are consistent with previous reports indicating lack of specificity of the ase assay. genotyping of samples was performed side-by-side with prase and pyrosequencing to investigate the accuracy of the methods. all loci were amplified in an outer 10-plex pcr followed by an inner 10-plex pcr for genotyping with prase and also inner simplex pcr reactions for genotyping with pyrosequencing. pyrosequencing was performed as previously described. a % concordance was achieved between the two assays. eight discordant genotypes were observed and these results were evenly distributed among all snps and pcr-plates. five of the ambiguities were settled with sanger dna sequencing as a third independent method, unfortunately there were no remaining genomic dna of the last three samples. prase was correct in four of the cases and pyrosequencing in one case. the robustness of the prase technology could be demonstrated by examining the genotyping data for all samples in the same cluster diagrams. each snp gave a distinct individual pattern that is very reproducible between runs. no traces of significant contamination is visible, in such a case the clusters would be indistinguishable. in fact, as seen in early results, before good conditions for the silicone rubber mask that divides the slide into wells was found, a contamination in a sample is obvious in its placement between clusters for several snps. this is a clear advantage of a multiplex detection system as opposed to the singleplex of pyrosequencing where a contamination is not always as obvious. furthermore, as indicators of contaminations five negative and one positive controls were included in each 96-well pcr plate. the negative controls typically gave lower signal intensities than positives and positioned themselves between clusters. in fact, all snps can be combined into a single plot of genotypes and still form three distinct clusters. nevertheless, the obvious differences in cluster patterns between different snps can be explained by variations in sequence context, affecting hybridization of extension primers to the target molecules and to the spotted signature tags. the variation in mmp is a 5t/6t insertion/deletion that may be difficult to analyze due to 3'-terminus instability of hybridized probes to this locus. in fact, mmp works very well considering that one of the allele-specific primers ends with six deoxythymidines and the other one ends with five deoxythymidines and a deoxycytidine theoretically giving the primers very different duplex stabilities at the 3'-terminus. in addition to accuracy and robustness, the reproducibility of the method was investigated by analyzing samples. the investigated samples were all derived from the same pcr reactions and divided into two prase reactions followed by hybridization to one microarray slide. standard deviations were calculated between the two allelic fractions for each sample. the mean sd was for all snps while for the individual snps, the mean sd ranged between and. furthermore, samples were assayed twice on separate dates. a mean sd of was obtained for the two separate runs and for the individual snps the sd ranged between and. the results here show that there is very little inter and intra chip variability proving the reproducibility of the assay. in addition, low sds reflects tightly held clusters.  as a complement to whole-genome snp typing technologies, where a large number of snps are examined in each sample, there is an important niche for technologies that accurately can type a large number of samples in not as many snps. in this work, genotyping of ten polymorphisms associated with thrombosis formation was performed with prase and % concordance was met when data was compared to pyrosequencing. however, the prase assay proved to be considerably less labor intensive due to its multiplexing capability in both pcr amplification and genotyping. yet, the number of investigated snps per sample may be further increased by design and addition of more signature tags on the arrays. there is a plentitude of genotyping technologies with similar multiplexing and sample capabilities as prase. some have been commercialized and are available in with specialized instruments and kits which naturally reduce the complexity for the user but at the same time increases costs and reduces the degrees of freedom for the researcher. some such as prase have only been described academically and it is therefore difficult to get a simple price quote but in this particular case running costs is in the range of usd per snp. some other techniques in the same applicaton niche as prase are limited in multiplexing capacity by the technique itself, such as pyrosequencing and various real time pcr assays, whereas others are limited by the amplification method, such as single-base extension with microarray or maldi-tof ms detection and prase. with ms detection, sbe has been limited to 30-plex detection due to a limited number of mass tags available or the resolution of the system. the similar microarray platforms used for sbe and prase would most likely be of similar multiplexing levels except that prase uses the double amount of primers and thus uses double the amount of spots on the microarray whereas sbe instead uses a two or four color detection hence a more expensive scanner. the multiplexing level for prase or conventional allele-specific extension and sbe seems to be much larger than previously anticipated; the same researchers have compared snps with ase and sbe and both methods are scalable to hundreds of thousands of snps in a single reaction. the premises upon which these were chosen are not clear and it is our belief that prase technology can offer significant improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness and thereof increase the number of typeable snps, i.e. a more flexible choice in snps. this is especially important since the most common biallelic variations in the human genome is the c-t and the g-a transitions that are also the most difficult polymorphisms to type by allele specific extensions if not the prase technology is employed. "," there is an imperative need for snp genotyping technologies that are cost-effective per sample with retained high accuracy, throughput and flexibility. we have developed a microarray-based technique and compared it to pyrosequencing. in the protease-mediated allele-specific extension, the protease constrains the elongation reaction and thus prevents incorrect nucleotide incorporation to mismatched 3'-termini primers.  the assay is automated for genotyping reactions in parallel followed by a tag-microarray detection system. a script automatically visualizes the results in cluster diagrams and assigns the genotypes. ten polymorphic positions suggested as prothrombotic genetic variations were analyzed with pyrosequencing and prase technologies in samples and % concordance was achieved. in addition to accuracy, the robustness and reproducibility of the technique has been investigated.  the results of this study strongly indicate that the prase technology can offer significant improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness and thereof increased number of typeable snps.

117," congenital cmv infection is the most widespread congenital infection in humans and is a major cause of neurological damages such as hearing loss, visual impairment and mental retardation in children. diagnosis of congenital cmv infection requires laboratory testing done on samples collected in the first three weeks of life. testing for cmv-dna in neonatal blood collected on filter-paper has proved a valid means of diagnosis with both clinical and epidemiological relevance. applications of this assay range from diagnosis in the neonatal period as an alternative to the conventional urine culture method to the unique quality of ascertaining whether damages arising during infancy are due to congenital infection. most laboratories use an in-house developed assay for detection of cmv-dna in dbs. however, no international standard is available and previous external quality assessment studies have shown that the quality of nucleic acid amplification methods such as pcr varies considerably between laboratories. therefore a quality assessment study for the detection of cmv-dna on dbs was recommended by the european congenital cmv initiative group and was organised by qcmd. we report the results of the cmv-dna amplification assays performed on a panel consisting of dbs with decreasing viral dna content which was prepared for the study.  thirty-three laboratories from european countries and two from south africa participated in the study. twenty-seven laboratories submitted their results for a total of datasets, as two respondents submitted two datasets and two sent three datasets each. few data on the characteristics of the participating laboratories are available as only a limited number of laboratories returned a completely filled out technical questionnaire. thirteen of the respondents operated in a university hospital setting and of the were accredited. five labs reported to have some experience in dbs testing. however, the annual number of specimens examined was usually small. the molecular analysis was performed by means of in-house nested-pcr or real-time pcr technologies. five datasets from three laboratories were obtained by means of commercial real-time pcr. nucleic acid extraction was performed by means of commercial kits in of datasets. only qualitative pcr results will be discussed as no more than five laboratories reported quantitative results of their real-time pcr assays. correct positive results on samples with a viral load of × copies/ml or higher were reported in ≥ 30/ of datasets. however, performance on samples with lower viral loads dropped rapidly, with only 59% and 12% of correct positive results in samples with × and × copies/ml, respectively. three laboratories reported a total of five false positive results. the same three labs were among the six that reported positive results for the × copies/ml samples but one of them was unable to detect the × copies/ml samples. n = nested pcr in-house on the applied biosystems geneamp pcr system sample pre-treatment: thermal shock. analysis of one punch in triplicate. real-time in house pcr on the applied biosystems abi prism sequence detection system. sample pre-treatment: qiagen dsp kit. ut1: analysis of three punches, ut2: analysis of the entire dried blood spot. thus, the × copies/ml dna concentration in the spiked whole blood represented the 50% sensitivity threshold of the tests. the panel was designed primarily to assess sensitivity, as this was regarded as the overriding problem in the detection of cmv-dna on dried blood spots. to allow comparison of the performance of laboratories, results were scored using a simple scoring system assigning two points for a correct result and zero points if the result was not correct. none of the datasets reported a maximum score of points. on average, in house real-time pcr performed less well than conventional pcr and commercial real-time pcr. in fact the mean score attained by the former technology was ± versus ± and ± of the latter methods, respectively. these differences were statistically not significant. the results of this first external quality assessment study indicate that methods should be improved in order to achieve better rates of sensitivity and specificity. a previous study showed that the median viral load in the cord blood of congenitally infected babies is × copies/ml. thus our study indicates that over 50% of laboratories would not be able to identify congenitally infected babies by analysis of dbs. only a few laboratories were able to detect a viral load of × copies/ml; the fact that half of these laboratories also reported false-positive results compromises the reliability of their results. false positivity involved 9% of laboratories and 11% of datasets. this strongly affects the reliability of the retroactive congenital cmv diagnosis because of the impossibility of confirming the positive results through the classical cmv isolation assay on neonatal urine sample. lack of adherence to strict measures aimed at avoiding contamination and carry-over are the most probable cause of false positive results. testing cmv dna on dbs presents several critical points. the methods of elution and extraction of dna, the amount of spotted paper, the characteristics of the individual pcr tests and the criteria for positivity all can affect the performance of the test. in this study we considered only the pcr methodology as assessment of the contribution of the various variables was not the intention of the study. also, the number of laboratories using the same or similar protocols were too small for such an analysis.  the importance of cmv-dna detection on dbs relies on the peculiarity of the sample which is routinely collected in many countries and can be safely stored for years. in the field of congenital infection diagnosis and epidemiology it can be used to assess the prevalence of the infection in large population groups, to conduct neonatal screenings aimed at identifying and treating children at risk of permanent sequelae because of the infection, and to evaluate the burden of the infection as a cause of permanent damage. the results of this first external quality assessment study indicate a clear need for improvement of methods. future quality assessment programs should collect more detailed data on all the critical points of the assay. the results of such further quality assessment studies will aid laboratories in adjusting the assay in order to achieve better rates of sensitivity and specificity and to fully exploit the test. "," testing for viral dna in neonatal blood dried on paper has proved a valid means of diagnosing congenital cmv infection with both clinical and epidemiological relevance. to assess the quality of the detection of cmv-dna on dbs in laboratories performing this test a proficiency panel consisting of nine samples with two blood spots on each filter paper was produced and distributed. six samples were derived from whole blood, negative for cmv dna and antibody, and spiked with cell-grown cmv towne in various concentrations, one was a cmv positive clinical specimen, and two samples were cmv-negative whole blood.  the responding laboratories from countries submitted datasets obtained by means of conventional pcr or real-time pcr technologies. a correct positive result was reported in at least 91% of datasets in samples with a viral load of × copies/ml or higher. however only 59% and 12% identified the × and × copies/ml samples, respectively, correctly as positive. false positive results were reported by 9% of laboratories and in 11% of datasets.  these results indicate a clear need for improvement of methods as sensitivity and false-positivity still appear to be a major problem in a considerable number of laboratories.

118," a great deal of effort and expense are being expended internationally in attempts to detect genetic polymorphisms contributing to susceptibility to complex human disease. concomitantly, the technology for detecting and scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms has undergone rapid development, yielding extensive catalogues of snps across the genome. population-based maps of the correlations amongst snps are now being developed with the aim to accelerate the progress of complex human gene discovery. a growing problem in complex disease genetics is the sheer volume of snp data being generated in gene discovery projects. with such large volumes of data available, it is essential to have the ability to examine results in a graphical form rather than text. linkage disequilibrium is a statistical measure of the non-independence of alleles at adjacent loci. two markers having alleles that are correlated with each other in a population are said to be in ld. such loci are generally in close physical proximity, but the relationship can vary dramatically. when a new variant is first introduced into a population it will be perfectly correlated with nearby variants. over successive generations the process of meiotic recombination will break down the correlations among nearby variants, and thus ld decays. markers that are in'perfect' ld with each other are entirely redundant in the sense that an individual's genotype at one locus will completely predict that at the other locus. conversely, markers that show no ld are statistically independent and convey no information about each other, even if they are in extremely close physical proximity. the indirect association mapping model that is the current paradigm for gene discovery in complex human disease relies on ld in the sense that the functional variant need not be studied at all, so long as one measures a variant that is in ld with it. we have developed a visualisation tool, referred to as java linkage disequilibrium plotter, to aid researchers in performing ld analysis. implementation jlin is written in java to enable cross-platform support, and is downloadable with a java installer. jlin has been tested on datasets ranging in size from several markers to in excess of markers. jlin is only limited by machine speed and memory size and has been tested on several hundred markers. while jlin has been tested on datasets containing nearly one thousand markers, we note that it is highly unlikely that a researcher will be looking for pairwise ld across thousands of markers as this implies a larger region than ld would normally extend across in an outbred population. coping with missing genotype data is an important and common problem when dealing with genetic datasets. jlin handles missing data by examining which snp genotypes for each individual contain missing data. rather than ignoring individuals with missing data, jlin only ignores a particular individual's data for pairwise ld comparisons where one or both of the snps contain missing data. this way, for all pairwise snp comparisons with no missing data, the data for each particular individual is fully utilised.  jlin is a customisable, intuitive ld visualisation tool. as no single ld measure appears to be the best for all circumstances, jlin allows the user to visually compare and contrast the results of a range of ld statistical measures. the ld statistics calculated are d, d', r or, pexcess, d and q, as described by devlin and risch, along with hardy weinberg equilibrium calculations for each snp marker. in addition, jlin has the ability to calculate empirical p-values for the pairwise association of two snps, as described by slatkin and excoffier, another unique feature amongst ld visualisation tools. we have developed a simple, intuitive interface that enables the user to customise the results presented. jlin allows the user to visualise one or two ld statistics in a single display along with the ability to export the display into three common publishing formats, namely portable document format, encapsulated postscript and portable network graphics. jlin accepts genotype data in a simple comma-separated value input file and imputes haplotypes using an expectation-maximisation algorithm. a visual representation of physical distance between markers is also available. in addition jlin has the ability to calculate empirical p-values, a unique feature among freely available and commercial ld analysis tools. the user has the flexibility to select different colour schemes, along with the ability to change the minimum, maximum and increment values independently for each of the statistics shown. future extensions to jlin will include calculating multi-locus haplotypes, imputation of missing genotype data and handling multi-allelic markers. a number of freely available and commercially released ld visualisation tools are available. gold has a rather distinct display format that is perhaps its strength and major weakness, in addition to being primarily windows based. lda and haploview are written in java, to enable cross-platform support, and implement a number of ld measures, but lda allows little flexibility or user control over the interface and presentation of results. gold and haploview do provide several features which are beyond the scope of jlin currently, such as the ability to utilise family data for haplotypes estimation and the estimation of haplotype tagging snps. helixtree is similarly designed in java, and while it has numerous features, is both commercial software and only freely available as a trial version. jlin introduces a number of unique features in terms of statistical calculation and presentation, and adds flexibility and customisation for the user that does not appear in existing ld visualisation tools.  jlin is a novel and intuitive visualisation tools designed to give the user capability and flexibility for ld analysis. jlin implements a wide range of statistical measures and analysis methods, coupled with export options and a range of features that forms a unique integrated analysis

119," the zebrafish has been established as an excellent model for studying any biological process. this organism possesses many advantages including ease of experimentation, optical clarity, drug administration, amenability to in vivo manipulation and feasibility of reverse and forward genetic approaches. the fish reach sexual maturity in only to months, and adult females are capable of producing to eggs weekly. many thousands of animals can be kept in a fish facility requiring much less space than mice or other mammals, and hence the zebrafish is regarded as a cost-effective experimental vertebrate model for large-scale genetic screening. furthermore, the high degree of homology between the zebrafish genome and that of humans makes such discoveries especially pertinent to human disease and development. morpholino antisense oligonucleotides have been widely used to inhibit gene function in zebrafish embryos and are usually used as sequence-specific translation-blocking or splicing-blocking agents. recently, a quantitative assessment of the knockdown efficiency of morpholinos has been performed in zebrafish embryos and its effectiveness proved. furthermore, microinjection of dna constructs into single-cell fertilized zebrafish embryos has also proven successful in the generation of transgenic zebrafish. the widespread use of fluorescent proteins in mammalian systems has been successfully adapted for use in zebrafish, which are well-suited to the use of fluorescence because of their optical clarity and external development. by linking a fluorescent protein such as enhanced green fluorescent protein or discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein to a gene or promoter of interest, expression can be easily visualized in living animals. the dual luciferase assay has been widely used in cell lines to determine rapidly and accurately the activity of a given promoter. although this strategy has been very useful, it does not allow analysis of the promoter and gene function in the context of the whole organism. to overcome these limitations, we have developed a protocol based on the dual luciferase system in zebrafish embryos. we illustrate the usefulness of this system for studying the promoter of telomerase, a key enzyme in the fields of cancer, stem cells and aging, and a nf-κb-dependent promoter, a master regulator of the immune response. the luciferase reporter dna plasmids were injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell developmental stage, together with mo or the expression constructs of interest, and the luciferase activity was determined in the time frame of mo activity. in addition, the flexibility of this assay is also illustrated by activation of the nf-κb-dependent promoters by simultaneous microinjection of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns. the protocol presented here provides details of how to apply the dual-luciferase assay to determining the activity of constitutive and inducible promoters in zebrafish embryos. this approach involves three steps: cloning the promoter of interest in the firefly luciferase reporter construct, microinjecting the embryos with this construct together with the appropriate renilla luciferase reporter and measuring the promoter activity with the dual luciferase system in whole embryo extracts.  the protocol presented here should result in very sensitive and accurate measurement of promoter activity and analysis of gene function in the context of the whole organism, which represents an important advantage over traditional measurement in cell lines. we first illustrated the usefulness of our protocol to analyze the promoter activity of zebrafish telomerase-reverse transcriptase. at h post-injection, the kb fragment upstream of the zftert coding sequence was able to drive the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter while the kb fragment failed to significantly increased the basal expression. therefore, the relative promoter activity of each fragment could be quantitatively determined. the critical step in the protocol presented here is the correct choice of the promoter used for normalization. the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter is a strong promoter used for both the in vitro and in vivo expression of proteins in signal transduction and gene therapy studies. however, cmv activity is induced by external stimuli such as endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria, cytokines and phorbol esters. therefore, for the study of nf-κb activation, we first have studied the effects of bacterial lps and dna in the expression of several renilla luciferase reporter constructs. among the four candidates tested, the cmv promoter was strongly induced by both pamps, i.e. escherichia coli lps and vibrio anguillarum dna, whereas the translation elongation factor ef1α promoter was inhibited by eclps and, to some extent, by vadna. in contrast, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and the early sv enhancer/promoter region showed a more constant expression and were therefore selected for further studies. figure 2c illustrates the profound effects of the plasmid used for normalization in the measurement of the induction of nf-κb. when using eclps, a vs. fold induction of nf-κb activity was obtained with the tk and the cmv promoters, respectively, indicating that induction of cmv by eclps resulted in the underestimation of the nf-κb activation by this pamp. similarly, vs. fold induction of nf-κb was observed with vadna when using the sv and the tk promoters, respectively, indicating that the inhibition of the tk promoter by vadna resulted in the overestimation of the nf-κb induced by this pamp. we finally validated the usefulness of this technique for studying a gene of interest by using mo-gene mediated knockdown. figure illustrates an example of the inhibition of the nf-κb activation triggered by vadna using a translation-blocking mo against myd, an adaptor protein involved in the downstream signalling following the engagement of bacterial dna by its cognate receptor. the results showed that injection of the mo against myd resulted in a significant inhibition of the nf-κb activation induced by bacterial dna, while injection of a mo directed against tlr which is involved in the recognition of double-stranded rna, failed to affect the nf-κb activation induced by bacterial dna. discussion the protocol presented here provides details of how to apply the dual-luciferase assay to determining the activity of both constitutive and inducible promoters in zebrafish embryos. beyond genetics and experimental tools, the strength of the zebrafish resides in the analysis of phenotype. perhaps no other organism is better suited to high-throughput phenotyping. the scale that can be achieved in zebrafish experiments is impressive by vertebrate standards. early zebrafish embryos are less than mm in diameter, allowing several embryos to fit easily in a single well of a 384-well plate. whole organisms offer several advantages over cell lines for forward chemical genetic screens, providing information on tissue specificity, toxicity and accounting for bioavailability. furthermore, cells are not transformed and are in their normal physiological milieu of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. use of the whole organism can also allow the screening of processes that are not easily replicated in vitro such as organ development. the advantages of zebrafish screening over invertebrate model organisms are their closer evolutionary relationship to humans. therefore, the assay described here represents a promising route to the identification and validation of novel drug targets. analysis of the promoter of newly identified genes that underlie zebrafish disease phenotypes might lead directly to the identification of novel drug targets or genes that can correct the phenotype. because zebrafish development occurs ex uterus and they have a large number of offspring, hundreds or thousands of embryos can be injected per day and the results of this assay can be obtained within 24– h, although shorter time points can also be analyzed if either the mrna coding for the gene under study or the recombinant protein are used. although some variation was found between replicates, these can be easily avoided by the high number of technical replicates achievable. the high-fold induction of luciferase activity, together with barely detectable levels of basal expression, makes it an ideal system for the in vivo analysis of inducible promoters. in addition, the assay can be combined with powerful mo-gene mediated knockdown or gene over-expression to rapidly determine the functions of a particular gene. therefore, this technique appears to be suitable for studying the activity and responses of different promoters and gene functions as well as for the validation of genetic constructs. however, this technique does not provide spatial information on gene expression and, therefore, it might be useful as a complementary technique to in situ hybridization and fluorescent microscopy. to avoid this limitation, all our promoters drive the expression of a fusion of egfp and firefly luciferase, which might allow the simultaneous determination of the expression levels and the spatial localization of the promoter under analysis. a shortcoming of the present assay, however, is the transient expression of the constructs and, therefore, only short-term responses of promoters can be studied. for example, the adaptive immune response can not be studied with the assay since it develops after several weeks. on the other hand, we have found that normalization is absolutely required for the elimination of experimental variations. as we have found that the renilla luciferase plasmid used for normalization can be induced by external stimuli, the choice of the normalization plasmid is critical. thus, the cmv immediate-early promoter, which is commonly used for normalization in both in vitro and in vivo studies, is significantly induced by external stimuli such as endotoxin and genomic dna from bacteria, as previously reported in cell lines with lps, cytokines and phorbol esters. however, this limitation could be easily overcome using other commercial renilla luciferase reporter vectors, such as those driven by the herpes simplex virus tk promoter or the early sv enhancer/promoter region.  we have developed a rapid and sensitive assay based on the classical dual-luciferase reporter technique which can be used as a new tool to characterize the minimum promoter region of a gene and the in vivo response of inducible promoters to different stimuli as well as in high throughput screening experiments. the flexibility of this assay is demonstrated by induction of the nf-κb-dependent promoters using simultaneous microinjection of different pamps as well as with the use of mo-gene mediated knockdown. "," the dual-luciferase assay has been widely used in cell lines to determine rapidly but accurately the activity of a given promoter. although this strategy has proved very useful, it does not allow the promoter and gene function to be analyzed in the context of the whole organism.  here, we present a rapid and sensitive assay based on the classical dual-luciferase reporter technique which can be used as a new tool to characterize the minimum promoter region of a gene as well as the in vivo response of inducible promoters to different stimuli. we illustrate the usefulness of this system for studying both constitutive and inducible promoters. the flexibility of this assay is demonstrated by induction of the nf-κb-dependent promoters using simultaneous microinjection of different pathogen-associated molecular patterns as well as with the use of morpholino-gene mediated knockdown.  this assay has several advantages compared with the classical in vitro and in vivo approaches. among others, the assay allows a rapid and quantitative measurement of the effects of particular genes or drugs in a given promoter in the context of a whole organism and it can also be used in high throughput screening experiments.

120," streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram positive diplococcus that colonizes the upper respiratory tract in about 20% of healthy humans, but is a leading cause of diseases such as otitis media, bacteremia, lobar pneumonia, and meningitis, particularly when enclosed in type-specific polysaccharide capsules. among the elderly, s. pneumoniae is the most common cause of fatal community-acquired pneumonia, and in children the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, middle ear infections and meningitis. from to resistance to s. pneumoniae has increased significantly, presumably due to the increased use of antibiotics. the first reports of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae strains appeared in the us in the early-1980s, then beginning in the 1990s their share increased from less than 5% of all isolates to approximately 35% in. similarly, resistance to macrolides is increasing, with 24% of all isolates being resistant in. to further complicate the issue, multidrug resistance is increasingly present among s. pneumoniae isolates, documented by a recent study showing % of all isolates to be resistant to at least three antibiotics. in light of this growing resistance problem, the identification and characterization of more potential targets for antibiotic therapy is of paramount importance. the inhibition of bacterial growth through antibiotics targeting cell wall biosynthesis has been a proven mode of action since the beginning of the antibiotic era. while penicillin targets the crosslinking reaction in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, there are also choices when it comes to inhibiting the formation of essential precursors for the peptidoglycan layer. one of those precursors, the amino acid d-alanine, is an essential component of the tetrapeptide crosslinking the glycan strands. it is provided through the racemization of the naturally occurring l-alanine, catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzyme alanine racemase. alr is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate containing enzyme, ubiquitous among most bacteria, and absent in humans. a lysine residue connected to the plp cofactor by an internal aldimine bond acts as a base for the conversion of d-to l-alanine while a nearby tyrosine from the second monomer acts as a base for the abstraction of a hydrogen from l-alanine. we have determined crystal structures of alanine racemases from other human pathogens in the past. notably, the enzymes from mycobacterium tuberculosis and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been resolved at high resolution. both enzymes are dimers with a similar domain makeup and include both an α/β-barrel at the n-terminus and a c-terminus primarily made of β-strands. because the active site of alr is small we are interested in identifying conserved residues that regulate the entrance of the substrate into the substrate binding pocket with the goal of developing compounds to control access of substrate to the active site. this paper describes the molecular cloning, expression, purification, and elucidation of the biochemical properties of the alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae. we show evidence that the alrsp gene encodes a functional alanine racemase through complementation of an e. coli d-alanine auxotroph, and through a specific spectrophotometric assay. we have obtained preliminary crystals of s. pneumoniae alr, and intend to incorporate the enzyme into our ongoing structure-based drug design program. determining the structure of alrsp is an essential prerequisite for the development of an accurate pharmacophore model of the enzyme. using our structure will allow us to conduct molecular dynamics simulations to obtain information about the different conformations of the enzyme, eventually yielding a dynamic pharmacophore model. using in silico methods, compounds from the available chemicals directory that fit the pharmacophore model will be identified and submitted to experimental testing, first in vitro and subsequently in vivo. proof of principle has been provided by our collaborators at the university of houston for the alanine racemase from g. stearothermophilus.  amplification and cloning of the s. pneumoniae alr gene the putative open reading frame for the alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae was identified through sequence comparison between known alanine racemase sequences and the s. pneumoniae sequences deposited in genbank. there was only one unambiguous hit in the database, suggesting that s. pneumoniae, unlike e. coli or p. aeruginosa, contains only one alanine racemase. the second alanine racemase when present is commonly part of an operon. the s. pneumoniae genome carries only this single gene, not apparently in an operon, and thus is lacking the l-alanine inducible catabolic dadx alanine racemase. using primers homologous to the 5' and 3' end of the putative alrsp an bp fragment was amplified and subsequently sequenced. the orf encodes a polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of daltons. using the restriction sites incorporated into the pcr primers the gene was ligated into the expression vector gene pet and cloned in e. coli mb sequence analysis of alr comparison and analysis of the protein sequence encoded by alrsp from strain r revealed full identity with the protein sequences from strains r and tigr. moreover, it displayed a high level of similarity with other alanine racemases, and carried the expected motifs such as the characteristic pyridoxal phosphate binding site near the n-terminus, and the two catalytic amino acid residues of the active center. phylogenetic analysis revealed no surprises; the enzyme is clustered with other streptococci species, such as s. mutans or s. pyogenes. these sequences, together with other alanine racemases from gram-positive bacteria appear to occupy one half of the phylogenetic tree, while the gram-negative bacteria occupy the other half. since both alanine racemase and certain human enzymes, such as serine racemase depend on pyridoxal-5'phosphate as their co-factor, it is important that antibiotic design efforts aim to develop inhibitors that are specific for the bacterial enzyme. however, it is worth noting that, in the case of serine racemase and alrsp both enzymes are indeed significantly distinct. the two racemases are only 13% identical on the amino acid level, so while they both may still be inhibited by the same small molecule, there is significant diversity between the enzymes, making it more likely that a potential inhibitor will actually be alanine racemase specific. in addition, our drug design efforts extend well beyond the plp binding site of the enzyme. as shown in our previous publication, alanine racemases are characterized by a geometrically distinct entryway to the active site that is made up of eight highly conserved amino acid residues. this entryway is fully conserved in the alrsp sequence; residues y y y and a form the inner layer, while residues r i r and a constitute the middle layer. sequence analysis of the human serine racemase fails to identify those conserved residues. we thus hypothesize that an inhibitor designed to block the entryway would specifically inhibit the bacterial target, alanine racemase, and be much less likely to cross-react with eukaryotic plp-containing enzymes. complementation analysis in vivo demonstration that the gene product expressed alanine racemase activity was shown by complementation. the d-alanine auxotrophic e. coli strain mb was transformed with pet17-alrsp. a plasmid encoding the cloned p. aeruginosa dadx alanine racemase, pmb was used as a positive control. pet without insert served as a negative control. cells were plated on lb medium with and without d-alanine supplementation, and scored for colony growth after h at 37°c. the alanine racemase gene from s. pneumoniae fully restored the wild-type phenotype, as did the p. aeruginosa dadx plasmid. cells transformed with pet failed to grow. thus the cloned s. pneumoniae gene encodes a functional alanine racemase. overexpression, purification and biochemical characterization the recombinant pet17-alrsp plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl plyss, and expressed upon induction of t polymerase. the enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as summarized in table purified enzyme was obtained in an overall yield of % and exhibited a fold increase in specific activity over the crude lysate. the molecular mass of the purified protein, estimated by sds-page analysis, was approximately kda, in line with the calculated value for the alrsp open reading frame. the kinetic properties of the purified s. pneumoniae enzyme are similar to other alanine racemases, it has a km for d-alanine at 23°c of mm and for l-alanine of mm. the vmax for the racemization is and u mg- respectively, where one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed racemization of μmol of substrate per minute. these values were used to calculate a keq of for this reaction, thus fulfilling the criterion for a chemically symmetric reaction. some recent data suggested that alanine racemases are either monomeric or dimeric. initially, molecular sieve chromatography was used to answer this question for alrsp. the molecular weight of five protein standards was plotted versus the ratio of their elution volume to the void volume of the column to yield a linear calibration curve. this curve was then used to determine an apparent molecular weight of daltons for alrsp, a value suggesting a dimeric state for the enzyme. in order to further classify alrsp we additionally performed dynamic light scattering using the superdex purified enzyme. when tested at mg/ml we observed a single peak with a hydrodynamic radius of nm and a monodisperse profile. this radius corresponds to a molecular weight of daltons, clearly suggesting that in solution the dominant form of alrsp is the dimer. even at lower concentrations of protein, we were not able to see any evidence for alrsp monomers, nor did we observe any mixed populations of monomers and dimers in the same preparation. as a result we conclude that this enzyme belongs to the majority of alanine racemases that form dimers, as do the enzymes from m. tuberculosis and p. aeruginosa. preliminary crystallization preliminary crystals for alrsp were obtained using a sparse matrix crystallization approach. initial crystals were obtained in m nacitrate, m hepes, ph. this condition was successively modified and better crystals of × × mm were eventually obtained in m nacitrate, m mes, ph, 10% glycerol. data analysis using x-ray crystallography is underway.  we have isolated the gene encoding alanine racemase from s. pneumoniae and obtained high level heterologous expression in e. coli as a dimer of kda. sequence homology, complementation of a d-alanine auxotroph, and a specific spectrophotometric enzyme assay confirm the identity of the cloned protein. with the recent acquisition of protein crystals described here, and the homology with other known alanine racemases whose structures are available, we anticipate the structure of this enzyme should soon be available, allowing it to be integrated into our ongoing structure-based drug design project. "," over the past fifteen years, antibiotic resistance in the gram-positive opportunistic human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae has significantly increased. clinical isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia or otitis media often display resistance to two or more antibiotics. given the need for new therapeutics, we intend to investigate enzymes of cell wall biosynthesis as novel drug targets. alanine racemase, a ubiquitous enzyme among bacteria and absent in humans, provides the essential cell wall precursor, d-alanine, which forms part of the tetrapeptide crosslinking the peptidoglycan layer.  the alanine racemases gene from s. pneumoniae was amplified by pcr and cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the amino acid, da dimeric enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and preliminary crystals were obtained. racemic activity was demonstrated through complementation of an alr auxotroph of e. coli growing on l-alanine. in an alanine racemases photometric assay, specific activities of and u mg- were determined for the conversion of d- to l-alanine and l- to d-alanine, respectively.  we have isolated and characterized the alanine racemase gene from the opportunistic human pathogen s. pneumoniae. the enzyme shows sufficient homology with other alanine racemases to allow its integration into our ongoing structure-based drug design project.

121," the dentate gyrus may be known best for its input from the entorhinal cortex and its mossy fiber projection to the ca. in addition, the dt has extensive associational and commissural connections considered crucial for the generation of gamma frequency oscillations and learning. most attention among the dentate interneurons may recently have received the cells in the hilus region due to their vulnerability to various injuries as well as their remarkable structural, histochemical and electrophysiological diversity. a few hilar neurons also project to the cornu ammonis and the subiculum. extrahippocampal projections from the dentate gyrus, however, are not known with the exception from some septal projecting neurons in the dthi usually considered displaced cells of ca. continuing our attempts to elucidate the hippocampal and parahippocampal circuits in mammals with a poorly differentiated brain the present study in the lesser hedgehog tenrec will demonstrate some true dentate hilar cells projecting to a circumscribed region in the olfactory tubercle. the projection may represent an additional parallel pathway transferring cortico-limbic information to the ventral striatum.  axo-terminal labeling in the striatum following tracer injections into the dentate gyrus among the experiments with tracer injections into the hippocampus two cases were injected with biotinylated dextran amine into the dentate area exclusively. these tracer injections mainly involved the dentate molecular layer but there was some tracer uptake by the granule cells as seen from the weak to moderate mossy fiber projection to ca. the sparse to moderate number of labeled cells in the dentate hilar region subjacent to the main injection site might be due to a retrogarde transport and/or a direct uptake of tracer substance. in et00-11b and et98-49w all layers of dt as well as the adjacent portions of ca were labeled directly with bda and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, respectively. the dt and portions of ca were injected with bda in et00-08b, while in the remaining experiments the injection involved the subiculum with or without an involvement of the dt and ca the latter two cases revealed the well-known hippocampo-striatal projection pattern to the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. no hippocampo-striatal projection, on the other hand, was found in et01-36b injected with tracer almost exclusively into the dtmo. the remaining cases consistently showed some fiber labeling in the tu but did not reveal any projections to the acb. the labeling in tu involved especially the molecular layer in the medial quarter of tu at levels rostral to the insula magna. in all cases but et01-21b the hippocampo-tubercular projection was represented on both sides with a slight ipsilateral predominance. in et01-21b the course of fibers towards tu appeared to pass exclusively within the molecular layer of the hippocampal continuation. in the other cases labeled fibers were seen in the hct as well as the fornix. a fiber course across the fornix appeared most likely for the contralateral projection as far as the contralateral hct was almost unlabeled and a fiber crossing was never observed for the hct-fibers unlike the fornix fibers. for the subsequent experiments carried out in order to identify more accurately the origin of the hippocampo-tubercular projections, it should be mentioned that similar to other reports there were also hippocampal projections to the diagonal band-medial septum complex. evidence for these projections was obtained from the bda experiments which revealed an extensive terminal-like fiber pattern across the dgms, but only few, if any labeled perikarya unlike the wga-hrp experiments. perikaryal labeling in the dentate gyrus following tracer injections into the striatum and septum there were two cases with wga-hrp injections involving the rostromedial tu including its molecular layer. the tracer injection in et03-58w showed a relatively circumscribed injection site; a direct labeling of the dgms, however, could not be excluded. in et01-47w there was some loss of tracer along the electrode tract leading to a contamination of the third layer of the hct. a control injection into the ventral septum including the dgms was available too as well as two tracer injections involving the acb. consistent with previous studies in subprimate species the tracer injections into the acb led to retrograde labeling of exclusively the sbi and ca. the septal injection, in addition, labeled numerous neurons in ca as well as a substantial number of cells in the dthi adjacent to the heavily labeled ca particularly at caudal levels. in the cases injected with tracer into the tu labeled cells were found in the hct, the sbi and the dthi. these cases, however, consistently failed to show any retrograde labeling in the ca. in et03-58w the labeled neurons in the dthi were restricted to its rostral third, while in et01-47w they involved rostral as well as caudal portions of the hilus. the latter case also showed a very few labeled cells on the contralateral side. a particular distribution of the labeled cells within the dthi was not obvious, and their poor dendritic labeling did not allow a further characterization of the cells. discussion unlike the dentate projection to the hct the projection to the olfactory tubercle cannot be explained by a retrograde-anterograde collateral transport of tracer. tubercular terminations are not seen in the case with a bda injection largely confined to the dentate molecular layer, and tubercular projections are noted in the cases with dentate injections of wga-hrp, a tracer substance not known to be transported in a retrograde-anterograde collateral fashion. moreover, the dentate-hilar neurons are also filled by the retrograde axonal flow from the tracer deposits in the tu. the projection to the olfactory tubercle differs from previously reported extrahippocampal projections from the dentate area as far as its cells of origin are confined to the dthi while the septal and hypothalamic projections arise predominantly from the ca and the sbi, only sparsely from the dthi. unlike the latter cells, therefore, the dentato-tubercular neurons can not be considered displaced cells of ca we have not characterized yet the particular morphology and histochemistry of these neurons and do not know whether their projections are distinct ones or arise as collaterals. nevertheless, it is a projection which involves a circumscribed region in the olfactory tubercle and avoids the nucleus accumbens, the main striatal target area of the hippocampus. these findings are in line with previous suggestions considering the medial tu as a separate striopallidal subdivision and fit with the concept of the parallel processing of cortico-striatal information. the question remains as to why a dentato-tubercular projection has not been demonstrated so far in other species. the projection may be unique to tenrecs or mammals with little differentiated brain but its apparent absence in other mammals may as well be explained by the low strength of its projection and/or its circumscribed field of termination. such a projection may easily be overlooked in anterograde tracer studies, especially in species with a large brain. retrograde tracer studies, on the other hand, have only been done in the rat and the hamster and it is questionable, whether their small circumscribed dentato-tubercular target area, if present, has been injected with tracer. rodent species, in addition, are not representative for studying the hippocampo-tubercular projections. in the rat, the tu receives considerably less hippocampal afferents from the ca1/sbi fields than in the tenrec, cat and monkey. similarly, the relative strength of the entorhinal projections to the tu as compared to the acb is much less in rodents than in non-rodent species. it may also be noted that the hippocampal continuation, the only other striatal input region projecting exclusively to the tenrec's rostromedial tu, is poorly represented in the rat compared to other mammals. one may speculate that the dentato-tubercular neurons in the dthi represent an extension of the hct into the dentate gyrus and are only present in species showing a well differentiated hct as e.g. in tenrecs and primates. unfortunately we still know little about the precise connectivity of the circumscribed dentato-tubercular target area. it receives few if any direct projections from the olfactory bulb but gets a distinct input from the anteromedial frontal cortex. the dentato-tubercular target area is likely to be part of a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop involving the mediodorsal nucleus and the prefrontal cortex, at least in subprimate species. notably, while the prefrontal and hippocampal afferents to the acb terminate in a predominantly non-overlapping fashion, the cortico-striatal fibers appear to overlap considerably with the hippocampal afferents in the tu.  the present data show for the first time a projection from the dentate gyrus to the rostromedial olfactory tubercle. its cells of orgin, located in the dentate hilus, cannot be considered displaced neurons of ca but represent true dentato-tubercular projection neurons. the projection is assumed to be present in other mammals, too. in the tenrec the dentato-tubercular projection overlaps with the subiculo-tubercular projection and the fiber terminations arising in the anteromedial frontal cortex. the circumscribed ventral striatal target area appears worth investigating in studies of the parallel processing of cortico-limbic information in tenrec as well as in cat and monkey. "," the dentate gyrus is well known for its mossy fiber projection to the hippocampal field and its extensive associational and commissural connections. the dentate gyrus, on the other hand, has only few projections to the ca and the subiculum, and none have clearly been shown to extrahippocampal target regions.  using anterograde and retrograde tracer techniques in the madagascan lesser hedgehog tenrec it was shown in this study that the dentate hilar region gave rise to a faint, but distinct, bilateral projection to the most rostromedial portion of the olfactory tubercle, particularly its molecular layer. unlike the ca and the subiculum the dentate gyrus did not project to the accumbens nucleus. a control injection into the medial septum-diagonal band complex also retrogradely labeled cells in the dentate hilus, but these neurons were found immediately adjacent to the heavily labeled ca while the tracer injections into the rostromedial tubercle did not reveal any labeling in ca  the dentate hilar neurons projecting to the olfactory tubercle cannot be considered displaced cells of ca but represent true dentato-tubercular projection neurons. this projection supplements the subiculo-tubercular projection. both terminal fields overlap among one another as well as with the fiber terminations arising in the anteromedial frontal cortex. the rostromedial olfactory tubercle might represent a distinct ventral striatal target area worth investigating in studies of the parallel processing of cortico-limbic information in tenrec as well as in cat and monkey.

122," vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine seafoodborne pathogen causing gastrointestinal disorders in humans. thermostable direct hemolysin and tdh-related hemolysin are known as major virulence determinants of v.parahaemolyticus. this bacterium is widely present in estuarine, marine, and coastal environments throughout the world. therefore, ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with v.parahaemolyticus is risk factors in humans. most v.parahaemolyticus isolates from the environment do not produce tdh or trh. virulent strains of v. parahaemolyticus are usually found together with larger populations of avirulent strains in the environment. the similarity in growth kinetics of the virulent and avirulent strains is a major obstacle for selective detection of virulent strains in seafood. total v. parahaemolyticus has thus been used as an indicator for control of food contamination toward prevention of infection. thermolabile hemolysin has been characterised by taniguchi and colleagues, which has been found in all v. parahaemolyticus isolates.. this hemolysin is species specific and not a virulence factor. this gene is therefore useful target for detection of total v. parahaemolyticus. detection of total v. parahaemolyticus using conventional culture- and biochemical-based assays is time-consuming and laborious, requiring more than three days. a rapid, reliable and practical assay for the detection of total v. parahaemolyticus has been sought. several pcr assays offer a more sophisticated approach to the identification of v. parahaemolyticus. although pcr assays provide more rapid identification of v. parahaemolyticus than conventional biochemical-based assays, they require electrophoresis in an agarose gel, which is time-consuming and tedious. real time pcr assays recently developed for identification of v. parahaemolyticus are rapider than conventional pcr assays due to the detection of fluorescence from amplification. real-time pcr assay is, however, not routinely used due to the requirement for an expensive thermal cycler with a fluorescence detector. among other techniques one promising candidate is a novel nucleic acid amplification method termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification. several investigators have developed lamp assays for detection of pathogenic microorganisims. lamp assay is faster and easier to perform than conventional pcr assays, as well as being more specific. furthermore, because the lamp assay synthesizes a large amount of dna, the products can be detected by simple turbidity. thus, compared to pcr assays, expensive equipment is not necessary to give a high level of precision. these features allow simple, rapid and cost-effective detection. also, the increase in the turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of dna synthesized. in addition, the preparation steps of the lamp assay are fewer than with conventional pcr and real-time pcr assays, and lamp assays require less time than those assays. although various lamp assays for the identification of pathogenic organisms have been developed, no assay for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus has been described. here, we describe a sensitive, rapid and simple lamp assay for the detection of v. parahaemolyticus. sensitivity was determined in pure cultures and in spiked shrimp samples.  lamp products were detected from all v. parahaemolyticus strains. no lamp products were detected from any of the non-parahaemolyticus vibrio and non-vibrio strains. the pcr assay required more than h, while the lamp assay was markedly faster, requiring for amplification 13– min in a single colony on tcbs agar from each of v. parahaemolyticus strains and less than min in spiked shrimp samples. the assay required less than min and min for detection of v. parahaemolyticus in a colony on tcbs agar and in spiked shrimp samples from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination. a) described in the methods section. as shown in table sensitivities of the lamp assay for v. parahaemolyticus aq in pure cultures and in spiked shrimp samples were found to be × cfu per ml. further, the sensitivity of the lamp assay was 10-fold higher than that of the pcr assay. the dilutions yielding - cfu per reaction showed an increase in turbidity and was visible as white turbidity but not that of cfu per reaction. sensitivities determined by the two methods were constantly matched with each other. when lamp assay performed in triplicate using μl templates dna containing cfu per reaction from pure cultures, two of three samples showed positive results, as well as using μl templates dna from shrimp samples. +, triplicate assay showed all positive. ±, triplicate assay showed both positive and negative. -, triplicate assay showed all negative. nd, not determined. discussion the bacterial culture test for the isolation and identification of v. parahaemolyticus from food samples after enrichment requires 2– d, with plating onto selective agars, sequential subculture and biochemical characteristic test. in contrast, the lamp assay was markedly faster. conventional pcr assay requires 4– h for amplification, electrophoresis and staining, while the lamp assay requires for dna extraction from samples and amplification less than 40– min. further, amplification of the lamp assay could be judged by visual assessment using the naked eye, without the need for electrophoresis. the lamp assay was more sensitive, rapid and simple than the conventional pcr assay. therefore, the lamp assay is more effective in detecting v. parahaemolyticus than the conventional pcr assay. in the preliminary tests, the lamp assay using and μl templates dna from shrimp samples was enough for amplification without any inhibition of the reaction in μl reaction mixture volumes. the pcr assay was, however, shown inhibited results in μl reaction mixture volumes. no pcr products were detected from the pcr reaction mixtures containing μl templates from shrimp samples. slight bands were detected from the mixtures containing μl templates. clear bands were obtained from each of the mixture containing μl or μl templates. it is known that some components of food inhibit dna amplification such as lamp and pcr assays. the results seem to suggest lamp is more resistant than pcr assay to inhibition by shrimp components. contamination of v. parahaemolyticus in seafood is one of the most important public health hazards. the frequent outbreaks caused by v. parahaemolyticus worldwide highlight the need for control of contamination of v. parahaemolyticus in seafood. especially, ingestion of fresh raw seafood as sushi and sashimi dishes in japan is a risk factor to humans. the total number of v. parahaemolyticus cells in fish fillets and shellfishes is required below cfu/g for raw consumption by law in japan. to reduce the risk of v. parahaemolyticus infection and to ensure food safety, our lamp assay would be significant in the detection of total v. parahaemolyticus in routine tests and in potentially applying to the most-provable-number method. rapid, simple and sensitive assay for detection of v. parahaemolyticus by lamp should facilitate the surveillance for control of contamination of v. parahaemolyticus in seafood. the lamp assay has potential value for rapid and simple screening of total v. parahaemolyticus-contaminated samples before they are consumed. although the shrimp samples were artificially spiked, we successfully developed the first lamp assay for detection of total v. parahaemolyticus from seafood samples. development of the lamp assay for detection of virulent strains of v. parahaemolyticus is required, as well as real-time and conventional pcr assays. further studies will be performed for detection of virulent v. parahaemolyticus and evaluation of the assay using a large number of seafood naturally contaminated by v. parahaemolyticus.  the lamp assay provided markedly more sensitive, simple and rapid detection of v. parahaemolyticus than conventional biochemical and pcr assays. the lamp assay for detection of v. parahaemolyticus required less than min in a colony on tcbs agar and min in spiked shrimp samples from the beginning of dna extraction to final determination. the lamp assay is a powerful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of v. parahaemolyticus, and will facilitate the surveillance for control of contamination of v. parahaemolyticus in seafood.

123," plants have developed survival strategies, including the strengthening of plant cell walls, to protect themselves from continuous abiotic and biotic stresses. as the first battlefield of the plant-pathogen interaction, plant cell walls, which are mainly composed of various polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicelluloses, provide tensile strength to plant cells and protect them from biotic invasion. during infection, plant pathogens secrete numerous cell-wall degradation enzymes such as cellulases, pectinases, and endo-β- -xylanase to degrade the cell wall and allow the pathogen to enter in the cell. the majority of these cwdes belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family, based on similarities in amino acid sequence, catalytic domains, protein folds, and overall architecture. recently, cwdes have attracted interest because of their utility in biotechnological processes, enhancing processes such as bread making and animal feed production, as well as their role as pathogenicity factors in plant pathogenic microbes. the microbial gh endoxylanase is an important enzyme in the hydrolysis of xylans, catalyzing the hydrolysis of β- -glycosidic linkages between the xylofuranosyl units in the xylan main chain in both cereals and hardwoods. comprehensive functional studies based on structural, biochemical, and molecular properties of these enzymes have been reported. at the same time, plants secrete a group of proteinaceous xylanase inhibitors to suppress pathogenic xylanases. these proteins are thought as “defense molecules” that protect plant cells from attack by pathogenic hydrolytic enzymes. two types of plant xylanase inhibitors have been well studied, i.e., xylanase-inhibiting protein -type inhibitors and triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor -type inhibitors. biochemical analysis revealed that a wheat xip specifically inhibits the expression of family- and − xylanases from aspergillus nidulans and aspergillus niger, respectively, while a taxi inhibits the expression of the family- xylanase of a. niger and bacillus subtilis. recently, three rice xips, including osxip, rice xip, and a putative rice xylanase inhibitor, were found to be differentially expressed during various developmental stages and under stress conditions. among these, osxip was predicted to be a class iii chitinase, based on bioinformatics analysis; however, no chitinase activity was detected for this protein. instead, the protein showed dosage-dependent xylanase inhibitor activity. in this study, we functionally characterized a chitinase-like protein from rice that is expressed at both the transcriptional and translational levels during fungal pathogen infection. the recombinant osclp protein has strong chitinase activity and can dissolve cell walls, leading to the release of cytosolic contents. this is the first report on taxi-like molecule with chitinase activity. this work provides new insights into the function of osclp in plant defense mechanisms.  sequence analysis and characterization of osclp from previous apoplastic secretome analysis of the rice blast fungus interaction, an xip, which was highly expressed upon magnaporthe oryzae infection, was isolated and identified. we then obtained a full-length rice xylanase inhibitor like chitinase gene using pcr. the deduced amino acid sequence of the osclp comprises amino acids with an expected molecular mass of kda and a pi of. a homology search of the deduced amino acid sequence of this gene using the genbank database revealed that osclp is homologous to taxi-type xylanase inhibitor. osclp contains an amino acid signal sequence at the n-terminus and a protein-protein interaction site at the c-terminus. this protein contains a putative xylanase inhibitor i-like domain between tyr and leu and is classified as a putative taxi-type inhibitor. such inhibitors have similar structures to those of the pepsin-like family of aspartic proteases. however, osclp does not contain the catalytic domain gxdxdxe, which is highly conserved in all class iii chitinases of plants, bacteria, and fungi. a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of osclp with that of other taxi-type inhibitors showed that osclp shares % identity with wheat taxi80s, % with wheat taxi-iv, % with wheat taxi-i, and % with rye taxi-type xylanase inhibitor. purification of recombinant osclp to measure the biochemical activity of osclp, which comprises his-tagged osclp without the signal peptide, we attempted to purify recombinant pqe30::osclp in e. coli using ni2+-affinity resins at various temperatures and with various final concentrations of iptg. soluble osclp was obtained when cells were cultured at 18°c with iptg at a final concentration of mm. the crude and soluble osclp were then separated by % sds-page, followed by coomassie brilliant blue staining. as shown in figure the protein appeared as one primary band of approximately kda on sds-page, which closely matched the calculated mw of kda that was determined after purification of the protein on the ni2+-affinity resins. the purification of soluble recombinant protein made it possible to investigate the biochemical activity of osclp. chitinase activity of osclp bioinformatics analysis revealed that osclp is a putative xip. to confirm the xylanase inhibitor activity of osclp, we carried out a xylanase inhibition assay using standard fungal endo- -β-xylanases isolated from t. aviride and a. pullulans. ten micrograms of purified osclp protein was pipetted onto filter discs, along with μmol of endo- -β-xylanases, on an agar plate containing xylan substrate. interestingly, osclp did not inhibit xylan degradation, while treatment with xylanase inhibitor or boiled xylanase had no activity. previous research has revealed that xip-i and taxi-i can reduce the activity of xylanase, while xip-i did not show chitinolytic activity due to the presence of salt bridges. however, our results show that osclp does not possess xylanase inhibitor activity against endo- -β-xylanases. recently, it was reported that an xip identified from coffee, caclxip, plays an important role in the inhibition of asian soybean rust spore germination through the xylanase inhibitor activity, but not the chitinase activity, of this xip. like caclxip, osxip also has xylanase inhibitor activity, although osxip was predicted to be a class iii chitinase. in contrast to caclxip and osxip, which lack chitinase activity, we wanted to confirm that osclp has chitinase activity by performing an in-gel chitinase activity assay. in this procedure, crude and purified osclp induced by iptg in e. coli, as well as a control with iptg, were separated by % sds-page in a gel containing glycol chitin. as shown in figure 2b, strong chitinase activity, in the position in which osclp was expressed, was detected under a uv filter. this suggests that the osclp protein displays strong chitinase activity. however, further functional analysis of osclp will be required, using biochemical and structural analysis approaches, to understand the different roles played by osclp and taxi-type inhibitors. transcriptional and translational levels of osclp after fungal infection in previous studies, taxi-type xylanase inhibitor genes were found to be induced by pathogens in wheat. to determine more accurately the induction level of osclp in response to infection by rice blast fungus, we evaluated the transcriptional and translational levels of this gene using semi-quantitative reverse transcription pcr and western blot analysis. rt-pcr analysis revealed that the level of osclp transcript rapidly increased within h of fungal inoculation in the incompatible interaction, which displayed few lesion-type symptoms on rice leaves compared to the control and compatible interactions. at the protein level, osclp was shown to be highly and rapidly accumulated in the incompatible interaction at h, while the level of osclp slowly increased in the compatible interaction at h. these results suggest that osclp plays an important role in plant defense response. antifungal activity of osclp the antifungal activity of osclp protein was evaluated in the presence of a pathogen. purified osclp protein is unstable to maintain inhibitory activity against slow grower m. oryzae. we therefore selected rhizoctonia solani, which grows more quickly than m. oryzae, to analyze the biochemical activity of osclp. in this experiment, we applied or μg of purified osclp protein to r. solani. treatment with μg bsa or μg/ml osclp protein showed little inhibitory activity on the growth of r. solani. when treated with or μg osclp protein, however, the growth of r. solani was inhibited. therefore, osclp displays antifungal activity in a dose-dependent manner. a close-up view of fungal hyphae after treatment with osclp protein was observed through a light microscope to investigate how osclp protein suppresses r. solani growth. the release of cytosolic contents occurred within minutes of osclp treatment. these data suggest that osclp might exhibit strong biochemical activity to dissolve fungal cell walls.  previous studies have suggested that xips are associated with defense, as they play a significant role in protecting host plants from pathogen attack. the amount of osclp released in response to pathogen infection increased at both the transcriptional and translational levels during incompatible interactions, suggesting that osclp is associated with plant defense mechanisms. however, in strong contrast to taxi-i and xip-i type inhibitors, recombinant osclp protein did not exhibit xylanase inhibitor activity against endo- -β-xylanases secreted from other fungi. instead, significant chitinase activity was detected in our experiment. this xylanase inhibitor-like chitinase protein inhibited the growth of the fungal pathogen r. solani. fungal cell wall structures were dissolved in the presence of osclp. we therefore suggest a new model for osclp activity: osclp expression is rapidly induced, and this protein is secreted from the host cell, in response to pathogen attack. the protein then attacks the pathogen by degrading the pathogen’s cell wall. "," during rice blast fungal attack, plant xylanase inhibitor proteins that inhibit fungal xylanase activity are believed to act as a defensive barrier against fungal pathogens. to understand the role of xips in rice, a xylanase inhibitor was cloned from rice. the expression of this gene was examined at the transcriptional/translational levels during compatible and incompatible interactions, and the biochemical activity of this protein was also examined.  sequence alignment revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of osclp shares a high degree of similarity with that of other plant taxi-type xips. however, recombinant osclp did not display inhibitory activity against endo- -β-xylanase enzymes from aureobasidium pullulans or trichoderma viride. instead, an in-gel activity assay revealed strong chitinase activity. the transcription and translation of osclp were highly induced when rice was exposed to pathogens in an incompatible interaction. in addition, exogenous treatment with osclp affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall. these data suggest that osclp, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens.  taken together, our results demonstrate that osclp may have antifungal activity. this protein may directly inhibit pathogen growth by degrading fungal cell wall components through chitinase activity. antifungal activitychitinaseoryza sativaxylanase inhibitor ",f0a43fc4-e725-41aa-8ee8-1321ea3422ad,pubmed
124," feline hepatic lipidosis is a common cholestatic disease affecting cats. it is considered the consequence of prolonged anorexia and subsequent dramatic lipolysis. feline hepatic lipidosis is characterized by an excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. although the exact mechanisms remain elusive, there is clearly an imbalance between the influx of fatty acids derived from peripheral fat stores and de novo synthesis of fa in the liver on the one hand, and the rate of hepatic fa oxidation and the efflux of hepatic tags via very-low density lipoprotein on the other hand. in cats with fhl, serum tag levels significantly increase with the greatest distribution into the vldl fraction. it has been suggested that a lower capacity to excrete vldl plays a role in the development of fhl. secretion of vldl is dependent on the rate of hepatic phosphatidylcholine synthesis. phosphatidylcholine is synthetized in the liver by two pathways, the kennedy or cytidine diphosphate-choline pathway and the phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase pathway. the kennedy pathway produces more saturated and mono-unsaturated acyl chain-containing pc, whereas the pemt pathway synthesizes pc with a long highly unsaturated acyl chain. the kennedy pathway is the major route for pc synthesis and is present in all mammalian tissues. the synthesis of pc via this pathway depends on the intake of choline. the pemt pathway is independent of choline intake and converts phosphatidylethanolamine to pc via the transfer of three methyl-groups from s-adenosylmethionine. the pemt pathway is liver-specific and is estimated to account for approximately 20–40 % of the newly synthesized pc in the liver in humans, mice and rats. in premenopausal women, intact female mice and rats it has been estimated that a larger fraction of pc is made in the liver via the methylation of pe, than in men, postmenopausal women and sterilised mice and rats. the role of choline in hepatic lipidosis has been evaluated in humans, cats and mice. both choline deficiency and low pemt activity have been associated with hl. suboptimal concentrations of dietary choline are associated in the cat with a diminished capacity of the liver to synthesize pc resulting in accumulation of lipids in the liver. in humans, mice and rats pemt expression and activity is known to be upregulated by oestrogens. this explains why premenopausal and intact females are less choline dependent than males or postmenopausal/spayed females. pre-menopausal women have a 30–50 % higher capacity than men to form pc de novo via the pemt pathway. premenopausal women and female rats on a choline deficient diet are less likely to develop hl than their male counterparts. postmenopausal women and castrated female mice with less pemt activity are considered more susceptible to develop pc deficiency and, subsequently, hl. center et al. have reported that female cats are more affected than male cats, but it is more commonly reported that fhl has no breed, age or sex predisposition. an explanation for an occasionally proposed sex predisposition in fhl has never been convincingly described. as demonstrated in other species, the loss of oestrogen influence could cause spayed female cats to have a lower capacity for pc synthesis than intact females. if so, spaying female cats, a practice widely performed in all western countries, could be a predisposing factor for female cats to develop fhl. the aim of this study was to analyse the lipid metabolism in healthy cats before and after spaying/neutering and subsequently the influence of sex hormones on pc synthesis via the pemt pathway.  cats six intact females with a median age of  months and intact males with a median age of  months were enrolled. median body weight of the female cats was  kg; median body weight of the male cats was  kg. all cats accepted the diet without any problems. results of the complete blood count, biochemistry and coagulation profile of all twelve cats, analysed following standard chemical analyses, were within reference intervals. the surgical procedures and ultrasound guided liver biopsies were without incident in all cats. the cats recovered uneventfully from anaesthesia and were discharged the day after. histological analysis histological evaluation of the liver biopsies performed in each subject at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks from the start of the diet revealed no histological changes compatible with hepatic lipidosis or other histological changes. hormone analysis the results of the sex hormones measurements in the blood of the male and female cats pre and post spaying/neutering are reported in table  oestrogen levels dropped significantly after spaying, indicating successful spay in all female cats. in one female cat, both before and after spaying, the oestrogen levels were below the detection limit of the test.table plasma oestrogen and testosterone levels before and after spaying/neutering a p <  male intact versus neutered b p <  female intact versus spayed the testosterone level dropped significantly in male cats, indicating successful neutering. plasma choline and liver pemt activity analysis free plasma choline levels were not statistically different between intact female cats compared to intact males. after spaying the choline levels increased in female cats by 35 % to levels similar to those in male cats pre and post neutering, but the increase was not significant.table plasma choline levels and hepatic indicators of phosphatidylcholine metabolism in male and female cats before and after spaying/neutering a pemt phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase bpc species implicated in pemt activity i.e. pc containing long highly unsaturated acyl chains c pe phosphatidylethanolamine activity of pemt varied considerably between samples and did not differ significantly between male and female cats before or after spaying/neutering, and no effects of spaying/neutering were found in either group. no correlation between the individual plasma choline levels and pemt activity was observed. as presented in table  no significant differences were observed in total liver pc and the pemt-specific pc species i.e. long chain highly unsaturated pc species, pc 38: and pc 40:, and the pc/pe ratio between male and female cats before or after spaying/neutering. discussion choline deficiency and low hepatic pemt activity have been associated with hl in humans, mice and rats. pre-menopausal and intact females in these species appear better protected from the development of lipidosis when exposed to a choline deficient diet. the up-regulation by oestrogens increases their capacity to synthesise pc via the pemt pathway, reducing the dependency on choline intake. also in cats, the importance of choline in the development of hl has been substantiated in supplementation and deficiency studies. this study could not demonstrate an effect of a reduced exposure to oestrogens on the pemt pathway and the level of pemt-specific pc species in cats. therefore, this study does not support the hypothesis that a down-regulated pemt pathway, as result of spaying/neutering, is a predisposing factor for the development of hl when cats are fed at recommended choline levels. the choline levels in the plasma were low compared to what has been established in humans and the earlier reported choline levels in cat plasma. however, the latter range has been established with a different assay method. the lower choline levels in the plasma may have been influenced by assay interference of substances in cat plasma. the choline levels in female intact cats tended to be lower compared to the levels in spayed female cats and male cats. nevertheless, this finding should be interpreted with caution based on the overall low choline levels close to the lower limit of quantitation. we have no clear explanation for the rise in plasma free choline levels after spaying in female cats, but it may suggest an effect of oestrogen on either choline uptake from the diet or on the conversion of choline to other metabolites like acetylcholine, betaine or phosphatidylcholine. in contrast to what has been reported in humans, mice and rats, the pemt activity tended to be lower in intact female cats than in male cats and spayed female cats. unexpectedly, there was no higher pemt activity in intact females before spaying, nor a decrease in pemt related parameters after spaying. this is in contradiction to what is anticipated when oestrogens would up-regulate the pemt pathway. the low pemt activity in intact female cats may not have reached significance because of the large variation in activity between samples. this may be partly due to the relatively low signals in the respective assays, making them more susceptible to variation in background noise. to further elucidate the activity of the pemt pathway, pc 38: and pc 40: and the pc/pe ratio were evaluated. phosphatidylcholine 38: and pc 40: are products of the pemt pathway and therefore reflect indirectly the activity of this pathway. the pc/pe ratio is also considered a proxy for the pemt pathway although it may also be influenced by the rate of the pc and pe synthesis and breakdown by other pathways. it is suggested that the higher the pc/pe ratio, the higher the pemt activity should be, as more pe would be converted to pc in the hepatocytes via three sequential steps of methylation. also, in these indirect parameters, there were no significant differences between the groups that could suggest an effect of oestrogen levels on activity of the pemt pathway. as the study was performed in client-owned cats, a diet with recommended choline content and not a choline restricted diet was used. with sufficient choline in the diet to allow pc to be formed via the kennedy pathway, the expression and activity of the pemt pathway may not have been fully stimulated. however, as it has been demonstrated in humans, mice and rats, the pemt pathway is also active with diets that contain sufficient choline for the specific species, contributing to 20–40 % of the pc produced. this study was performed in a relatively small series of animals. a power analysis indicated that cats per group would have been sufficient to evaluate the hormonal effect on the pemt pathway. the power analysis was based on the assumption that changes needed to be large to be considered clinically relevant. nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that significant differences would be found with larger numbers. it is possible that the difference of prevalence of lipidosis in female cats compared to male cats might be associated to a specific female lipid profile. further evaluation of lipid profiling of liver and plasma of healthy female and male cats before and after spaying/neutering may help to clarify potential sex difference in cats.  phosphatidylcholine synthesis in cats, when fed a recommended amount of choline in the diet, seems to differ from what has been observed in humans, mice and rats, with no evidence of influence of sex hormones on the pemt pathway. current recommendations for diet choline levels are adequate for spayed female cats and it is unlikely that castration predisposes cats for hl by causing pc deficiency as suggested in other species when recommended dietary choline level are provided. "," feline hepatic lipidosis is a common cholestatic disease affecting cats of any breed, age and sex. both choline deficiency and low hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase activity are associated with hepatic lipidosis in humans, mice and rats. the pemt expression is known to be upregulated by oestrogens, protecting the females in these species from the development of hl when exposed to choline deficient diets. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of sex hormones on choline synthesis via the pemt pathway in healthy male and female cats before and after spaying/neutering, when fed a diet with recommended dietary choline content.  from six female and six male cats pemt activity was assayed directly in liver biopsies taken before and after spaying/neutering, and assessed indirectly by analyses of pemt–specific hepatic phosphatidylcholine species and plasma choline levels. hepatic pemt activity did not differ between intact female and male cats and no changes upon spaying/neutering were observed. likewise, no significant differences in liver pc content and pemt-specific polyunsaturated pc species were found between the sexes and before or after spaying/neutering.  these results suggest that choline synthesis in cats differs from what is observed in humans, mice and rats. the lack of evident influence of sex hormones on the pemt pathway makes it unlikely that spaying/neutering predisposes cats for hl by causing pc deficiency as suggested in other species. keywords catshepatic lipidosischolinepemtoestrogenissue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",ba56c6d6-669d-4b10-9b99-a461bee827bc,pubmed
125," the development of high-throughput genomic technologies, makes it possible to study dependencies and regulation among genes on a genome-wide scale. in last decade, the amount of gene expression data has increased rapidly necessitating development of computational methods and mathematical techniques to analyze the resulting massive data sets. in order to understand the functioning of cellular organisms, why complicated response patterns to stressors are observed, and provide a hypothesis for experimental verification, it is necessary to model gene regulatory networks. currently, clustering, classification and visualization methods are used for reconstruction or inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data sets. these methods generally group genes based on the similarity of expression patterns. based on large-scale microarray data retrieved from biological experiments, many computational approaches have been proposed to reconstruct genetic regulatory networks, such as boolean networks, differential equations, bayesian networks and neural networks. among these approaches, boolean network methods and bayesian network methods have drawn the most interest in the field of systems biology. much recent work has been done to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from expression data using bayesian networks and dynamic bayesian network. bayesian network approaches have been used in modeling genetic regulatory networks because of its probabilistic nature. however, drawbacks of bayesian network approaches include failure to capture temporal information and modeling of cyclic networks. dbn is better suited for characterizing time series gene expression data than the static version. perrin et al. used a stochastic machine learning method to model gene interactions and it was capable of handling missing variables. zou et al. presented a dbn-based approach, in which the number of potential regulators is limited to reduce search space. yu et al. developed a simulation approach to improve dbn inference algorithms, especially in the context of limited quantities of biological data. in, xing and wu proposed a higher order markov dbn to model multiple time units in a delayed gene regulatory network. recently, likelihood maximization algorithms such as the expectation-maximization algorithm have been used to infer hidden parameters and deal with missing data. the boolean network model, originally introduced by kauffman is also very useful to infer gene regulatory networks because it can monitor the dynamic behaviour in complicated systems based on large amounts of gene expression data. one of the main objectives of boolean network models is to study the logical interactions of genes without knowing specific details. in a boolean network, the target gene is predicted by other genes through a boolean function. a probabilistic boolean network, first introduced by shmulevich et al. in is the stochastic extension of boolean network. it consists of a family of boolean networks, each of which corresponds to a contextual condition determined by variables outside the model. as models of genetic regulatory networks, the pbn method has been further developed by several authors. in, a model for random gene perturbations was developed to derive an explicit formula for the transition probabilities in the new pbn model. in, intervention is treated via external control variables in a context-sensitive pbn by extending the results for instantaneously random pbn in several directions. some learning approaches for pbn have also been explored. considering the same joint probability distribution over common variables, several fundamental relationships of two model classes have been discussed in. in this paper, two important computational approaches for modeling gene regulatory networks, pbn and dbn, are compared using a biological time-series dataset from the drosophila interaction database to construct a drosophila gene network. we present the pbn and dbn approaches and grn construction methods used and discuss the performance of the two approaches in constructing grns.  a real biological time series data set was used to compare pbn and dbn approaches for modeling gene regulatory networks. the raw data was preprocessed in the same way as given in. there were gene samples with time points available in drosophila melanogaster genes network through the four stages of the life cycle: embryonic, larval, pupal and adulthood. an example network of drosophila muscle development is given in, in which muscle-specific protein is treated as hub gene in their inferred network. we used a different subset of the genes which participate in the development of muscle. particularly, mlp84b and other genes which contribute to larval somatic muscle development were used to infer gene regulatory networks. the d. melanogaster gene muscle lim protein at 84b has also been known in flybase as lim it encodes a product with putative protein binding involved in myogenesis which is a component of the cytoplasm. it is expressed in the embryo. table shows the scores of mlp84b interacting with other related genes. here, we first selected genes to infer grns using pbn and dbn. the constructed grns are shown in figure there exists interactions totally within this small larval somatic muscle network. and interactions in the network have been successful identified. most interactions between mlp84b and genes with high confidence have been inferred. more comparison results of pbn and dbn are given in table where n is the number of nodes in network and e the number of edges among the nodes. pbn means that there are nodes and edges in that pbn simulation. to analyze the effect of network size on the inference accuracy, four combinations,,, and, were considered for inferring gene network. for each combination, we randomly selected five subsets of genes of the same numbers of genes and edges from the drosophila gene network. for each subset genes, we inferred a gene network and retrieved the number of correct edges ce, miss errors me, and false alarm errors fe. for each combination, the average and range of ce, me and fe were calculated, as given in table a correct edge is the one that exists in a real network and is successfully identified by the inference methods. miss error is defined as the edge between two genes that exists in a real network, but the inference algorithms miss or make wrong orientations. false alarm error is the edge that the inference algorithms create but does not exist in the real network. we used the benchmark measures recall r and precision p to evaluate performances of inference algorithms for pbn and dbn. while different definitions for recall and precision exist, in this paper, r is defined as ce/ and p is represented as ce/. the selection of subset genes in network was based on the current existing gene interactions and network diagram in the drosophila genes network. the results in table show that for the same case, dbn reduces miss errors but increases false alarms errors slightly. for all cases, dbn can identify more corrected edges than pbn and hence improve recall. the precision of dbn is better in three cases but worse in one case than pbn. for both pbn and dbn methods, recall and precision decrease if the number of genes increases. one can see that if more genes are selected for inferring grns, the network contains more edges and it is more difficult to successfully identify the interactions among genes. while the dbn method can give better recall of identifying genetic network interactions, it is more time-consuming than pbn. discussion it is challenging to infer grns from time series gene expression data. among thousands of genes, each gene interacts with one or more other genes directly or indirectly through complex dynamic and nonlinear relationships, time series data used to infer genetic networks have low-sample size compared to the number of genes, and gene expression data may contain a substantial amount of noise. different approaches may have different performances for different datasets. moreover, inference accuracy depends not only upon models but also on inference schemes. in this paper, we only select two representative inference algorithms for pbn and dbn to model the grns, respectively. it is desirable to perform a more comprehensive evaluation of the two approaches with different inference methods and to develop the more robust algorithm and techniques to improve the accuracy of inferring grns.  pbn-based and dbn-based methods were used for inferring grns from drosophila time series dataset with time points obtained from the drosophila interaction database. the results showed that accuracy in terms of recall and precision can be improved if a smaller subset of genes is selected for inferring grns. both pbn and dbn approaches had good performance in modeling the gene regulatory networks. in all tested cases, dbn identified more gene interactions and gave better recall than pbn. the accuracy of inferring grns was not only dependent upon the model selection but also relied on the particular inference algorithms that were selected for implementation. different inference schemes may be applied to improve accuracy and performance. "," the regulation of gene expression is achieved through gene regulatory networks in which collections of genes interact with one another and other substances in a cell. in order to understand the underlying function of organisms, it is necessary to study the behavior of genes in a gene regulatory network context. several computational approaches are available for modeling gene regulatory networks with different datasets. in order to optimize modeling of grn, these approaches must be compared and evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency.  in this paper, two important computational approaches for modeling gene regulatory networks, probabilistic boolean network methods and dynamic bayesian network methods, are compared using a biological time-series dataset from the drosophila interaction database to construct a drosophila gene network. a subset of time points and gene samples from the whole dataset is used to evaluate the performance of these two approaches.  the comparison indicates that both approaches had good performance in modeling the gene regulatory networks. the accuracy in terms of recall and precision can be improved if a smaller subset of genes is selected for inferring grns. the accuracy of both approaches is dependent upon the number of selected genes and time points of gene samples. in all tested cases, dbn identified more gene interactions and gave better recall than pbn. 1– february fourth annual mcbios conference. computational frontiers in biomedicine new orleans, la, usa ",f10e4e1d-1b57-4a4a-8ded-90bbdad85182,pubmed
126," epstein-barr virus is a ubiquitous human b-lymphotropic herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of the world's population and establishes a lifelong infection in its host. it has been estimated that the number of ebv-infected b cells is controlled in healthy individuals by ebv-specific immunity. nevertheless, ebv is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several malignant proliferative disorders such as burkitt's lymphoma, hodgkin's lymphoma, some b- and t-cell non-hodgkin's lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma. in immunocompromised subjects, active ebv infection is a strong risk factor for the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and aids-related lymphoma. quantitative molecular assays for the assessment of viral load have helped to describe and monitor ebv-related diseases. although highly sensitive, however, conventional quantitative pcr is rather laborious and time-consuming. in contrast, real-time amplification technology can overcome these difficulties. a range of different assay formats and protocols involving taqman probes and fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes have been reported and various in-house and commercial assays for ebv load measurement are available. however, the considerable differences in ebv load detected by quantitative assays constitute an unsolved problem. this study compares the performance of two real-time pcr assays for ebv dna: a commercial kit and an in-house assay.  in order to evaluate the dynamic range of the assays, serial five-fold dilutions of culture supernatant derived from an ebv-positive cell line were tested in triplicate by both methods. these were prepared since high-titre reference material was not available. for each method, linear results were obtained up to 3-log dilution, whereas the three further five-fold dilutions showed comparable quantitative results. only 1– out of replicates were detected in the last two possible dilutions, while 10- dilution was negative in both assays. altogether, the in-house assay showed a remarkable overestimation of quantitative results, as compared to the commercial assay. to establish the level of precision, inter- and intra-assay variability was determined by amplifying replicates of three dilutions of ebv-positive culture supernatant using the same dna as a sample in both methods. intra-assay variability of the q-ebv pcr and ebv rq-pcr methods was determined by amplifying all samples in quadruplicate, whereas inter-assay variability was determined by amplifying the three dilutions in triplicate in four independent experiments. overall, the last dilution reached in both methods the highest coefficient of variation and linearity lack for values near or just below the cut-off level. moreover, the in-house ebv rq-pcr reached a slightly higher intra-assay precision and lower inter-assay precision, compared to the commercial assay. the accuracy of the two methods was evaluated using a quality control for molecular diagnosis ebv proficiency panel. aliquots of qcmd samples were extracted and aliquots of the dna samples were analysed at the same time by each assay, avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles. both methods correctly classified the only negative sample and all the samples containing more than copies/ml, as determined by em. only q-ebv-pcr detected three more samples with a viral load of 100– copies/ml, though not all replicates were positive. quantitative results indicated an overestimation by ebv rq-pcr and an underestimation by q-ebv-pcr, as compared to em quantification. of consecutive plasma samples received by our laboratory for ebv dna quantification, were positive and negative by both methods. all the samples were monitored for the presence of inhibitors by adding internal positive controls, beta globin and actin dna, and no negative results or partial amplification were observed. all the plasma samples from healthy blood donors were negative in both assays. the mean copy numbers for the positive plasma samples was respectively copies/ml and copies/ml. considering all the samples positive to both tests and including the qcmd ebv panel samples and serial dilutions of culture supernatant obtained from immortalized clinical specimen lymphocytes, the results of the two methods were statistically correlated. a systematic difference was noted by plotting the mean value of each positive sample tested by both assays against the difference between the results of the two methods, with about log mean overestimation by ebv rq-pcr. the different levels of circulating ebv dna measured by each assay might be due to a difference in pcr efficiency. pcr efficiency was calculated by the equation e = - the mean percentage of pcr efficiency, based on consecutive experiments measuring inter- and intra-assay variability, was % for q-ebv pcr and % for ebv rq-pcr. one of the variables possibly affecting pcr efficiency is the source of dna used as a standard for quantification. to test this hypothesis, samples of namalwa cellular dna used in the standard curve of the in-house method were amplified in the commercial assay: ebv dna values were on average fold lower than expected. by contrast, when namalwa dna dilutions were used as a standard in the same experiment, pcr efficiency was about 8% lower. the amplification of the plasmid standards enclosed in the q-ebv pcr kit yielded copy numbers fold higher than the expected average. discussion the quantification of ebv dna load is useful for detecting viral reactivation, which increases the risk of ptld in immunosuppressed patients, and monitoring antiviral therapy. in addition, recent studies suggest that ebv dna fragments are released from tumour cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and ebv-positive lymphomas. in such cases, the ebv dna load may be used as a surrogate disease activity marker with potential applications in clinical monitoring and prognostication. in order to determine the clinical significance of an ebv load, it might be better to monitor viral load dynamics in patients by quantification of ebv load in peripheral mononuclear cells, though ebv dna is detectable during active infection for a longer period in whole blood than in plasma. however, the real-time pcr protocol used in these assays is preferable for the quantification of viral load in plasma or liquor. today a wide variety of quantitative pcr assays are available for ebv dna quantification, including quantitative-competitive pcr and real-time pcr. they are faster than conventional quantitative pcr and employ a close-tube system that eliminates the need for post-pcr analysis, thus reducing the risk of contamination. although real-time pcr assays are known to be of excellent diagnostic value in certain clinical settings, interlaboratory standardization of ebv dna load monitoring has yet to be achieved. we compared the performance of two real-time pcr assays for ebv dna quantification in plasma, one of which is commercial and the other in-house. false negative results, due to the presence of inhibitors, did not occur and none of the samples inhibited amplification of the internal positive control in either of the real-time pcr assays. these results confirm that the method used for dna extraction does provide an inhibitor-free target for quantitative assessment by pcr. several factors have been linked to variation in pcr results, including pcr reagents, primer stability and specificity, and pcr product size. the choice of target region for amplification is known to influence significantly the results of quantitative ebv dna assays. one of the most widely used pcr targets, the bamhi-w region, occurs in multiple repeats which can vary considerably across naturally occurring ebv isolates. for this reason, the ebv dna load can be up to 5-fold higher when bamhi-w primers are used, as compared to primers located in single-copy ebv genes. this observation, however, does not account for the discrepancies observed in the present study, as both assays amplify the single-copy ebna- gene. real-time pcr quantification relies on the assumption that amplification efficiencies are the same for patient samples and in the standard used for calibration. low amplification efficiency in patient samples, compared to the calibrator, lead to underestimation of the dna content in samples. alternatively, it can be argued that the decreased pcr efficiency of standards may lead to overestimation of dna samples. the dna standard source used to build a calibration curve appears to be crucial in determining the final outcome of quantification. indeed, we observed a lower rate of efficiency in the in-house assay, using a genomic standard, as compared to the commercial assay, which employs a plasmid standard. the influence of calibrator dna on the assay's quantitative results is supported by the observation that when genomic dna was used as a standard in the commercial assay, amplification efficiency was lower, and higher ebv dna values were measured on plasmid samples containing known amounts of ebv dna.  our results suggest that commercial and in-house assays for the quantification of ebv dna are both appropriate for clinical use because they perform similarly in analytical terms and generate correlated quantitative results. the use of common standards would help to achieve comparable absolute values, thus limiting the high degree of variability in ebv dna load shown by various assays and improving the diagnostic significance of real-time ebv copy number quantification. given the high coefficients of variation involved, it would also help to specify the confidence interval in reported results, so that viral load fluctuations are not misinterpreted as clinically significant data. "," epstein-barr virus dna load monitoring is known to be useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of ebv-associated diseases. the aim of this study is to compare the performance of two real-time pcr assays for ebv dna: a commercial kit as the q-ebv real-time system and an in-house assay.  the range of linearity and the degree of precision of the two assays were similar. the clinical sensitivity of q-ebv pcr was higher for reference samples containing less than ebv dna copies/ml. the absolute quantitative results of the two methods were statistically correlated, with the systematic overestimation by ebv rq-pcr possibly linked to different amplification efficiency in calibration standards.  both the commercial and the in-house assay may be appropriate for clinical use, but common standards are advisable for comparable absolute values, as these would improve the clinical utility of ebv dna load measurement.

127," microarray chips are a powerful technology capable of measuring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. expression profiling has led to dramatic advances in the understanding of cellular processes at the molecular level, which may lead to improvements in molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine. the number of experiments involving microarrays grows nearly exponentially each year. several platforms are currently available, including the commonly used short oligonucleotide-based affymetrix genechip® arrays, which utilize multiple probes for each gene and automated control of the experimental process from hybridization to quantification. although microarrays have tremendous potential, great effort and care is required in planning and designing microarray experiments, analyzing gene expression data, and interpreting results. a typical microarray experiment has many different sources of variation which can be attributed to biological and technical causes. biological variation results from tissue heterogeneity, genetic polymorphism, and changes in mrna levels within cells and among individuals due to sex, age, race, genotype-environment interactions and other factors. biological variation reflects true variation among experimental units and is of interest to investigators. however, preparation of samples, labeling, hybridization, and other steps of microarray experiment can contribute to technical variation, which can significantly impact the quality of array data. to ensure highly reproducible microarray data, technical variation should be minimized by controlling the quality of the rna samples, and by efficient labeling and hybridization. identifying sources of experimental variation and assessing their magnitude are important for optimal experimental design, as for example, in the planning of mrna pooling in microarray experiments. similarly, this information is useful for estimating the optimal number of required technical replicates because measurement accuracy and reliability affect researchers' power to identify differentially expressed genes. however, other considerations, such as the goals of the study, the features of a particular microarray platform, or the cost of arrays and samples may influence experimental design. several studies have been conducted to examine the relative contributions of various factors in different experimental settings. here, we estimated the relative magnitudes of sources of variation in experiments involving affymetrix genechip® arrays and evaluated agreement between biological and technical replicates.  experimental design the experiment was set up as described in materials and methods. source *.cel data files from genechip® arrays were subjected to image processing by four popular methods for probe-level data implemented in bioconductor: dna chip analyzer, mas, rma, and gcrma-eb. variance components estimation for each probe set, expression levels were modeled as follows: yg = μg + bg + lg + εg, where bg ~ n is the effect of biological variation among experimental units; lg ~ n is the effect of labeling nested within biological replications; and, εg ~ n is the residual error. it should be noted that in our case biological variation could be confounded by technical variation arising during tissue isolation and preparation of mrna samples. dobbin et al., found that variation at this stage of microarray processing was small compared to variation at the hybridization step. the model was fit separately on the gene expression measurements of each of dchip, mas, rma and gcrma-eb probe set summaries. both the effects of biological replication and the labeling effect nested within biological cases were treated as random. we estimated variance components and applied shrinkage variance estimators to them. these shrunken estimators borrow information across genes and have been shown to improve statistical tests. figure shows the density plots of the distributions of relative magnitudes of different sources of variation. the results indicated that for most of the genes, the biggest source of variation was biological when using dchip and rma, whereas the biggest source of variation was residual error when using gcrma-eb or mas. for all algorithms, a significant number of probe sets had biological and labeling variance components estimates equal or very close to zero. the findings are summarized in table assessment of reproducibility we investigated agreement between technical replicates and biological replicates using pearson correlations between chips. the correlations for the following three groups were compared: correlations between two technical replicates at the hybridization stage within a biological replicate; correlations between two technical replicates at the labeling stage within a biological replicate; correlations between different biological replicates. results indicated that technical replicates at the hybridization step agree more closely either than technical replicates at the labeling stage or than different biological replicates. this finding can be illustrated using scatter plots: regardless of the image processing method, technical replicates of the same biological replicate show less dispersion than data from different animals. the reproducibility at the hybridization stage was assessed by testing the significance of the differences between expression levels of technical replicates at the hybridization step using a paired t-test analysis as described in material and methods. briefly, for each probe set we tested the hypothesis that a difference in expression levels between two technical replicates is equal to zero. a total of paired t-tests were conducted and p-values obtained for each image processing algorithm. the distribution of p-values was modeled using a mixture model approach. under a global null hypothesis, there are no differentially expressed genes and distribution of p-values is expected to be uniform on. if some genes are truly differentially expressed, we expect an increased number of small p-values. distributions of p-values for the data obtained by four image processing methods are presented on figure by fitting the mixture of two beta distributions, one can estimate proportion of differentially expressed genes. we obtained the following estimates: dchip – %; mas – %; rma – %, and gcrma-eb – %. thus, at the nominal α-level, the number of differentially expressed genes was smaller than expected by chance when data were processed with mas or rma, but above the nominal α-level when data was processed with dchip or gcrma-eb. discussion using affymetrix genearray® chips, we examined the relative magnitudes of different sources of variation in microarray experiment. analysis of variance using mixed-effects linear models is a common way to account for and test the significance of various factors contributing to overall variation. due to limitations of our hierarchical unbalanced experimental design and relatively small number of degrees of freedom, we did not include factors that can potentially contribute to variation such as day of processing, scanning order, mrna preparation, etc. we assume that such factors were not significant. however, to formally test this assumption, another experiment is needed. we used a general linear model to partition variance for each probe set into three components. the first source was biological variation. the biological variation may be confounded by technical variation at the mrna preparation step, but this variation is probably relatively small compared to variation at the hybridization step. thus, we assume that most of the variation for this effect was due to true biological differences among animals. the second source of variation was the effect of labeling. although our experiments were carried out by the same person, using the same equipment, under the same experimental conditions as much as realistically possible, there is always some variation caused by minor environmental differences in temperature, duration, pipetting etc., which influences labeling efficiency. the third source of variation other than animal-to-animal variation and labeling-effect variation was residual error caused by differences in hybridization, scanning and other factors. to compare the relative magnitudes of different sources of variation, we estimated variance components and applied shrunken variance estimators that borrow information across genes. we constructed these shrunken variance estimators by shrinking a group of individual variance estimators toward their common corrected geometric mean. the amount of shrinkage depends on the variation on the individual variance components estimators. these estimators were shown to be robust in respect to variance heterogeneity in gene expression data among groups. we found that our results depend on the image processing algorithm used: biological variation was the largest source when dchip or rma were used, but when *.cel files were processed with gcrma-eb or mas, the largest source was residual error. bakay et al., found that biological variation presumably caused by tissue heterogeneity and genetic polymorphism was a major source of variation while technical variation was minor. han et al., found that biological variation was about of the same size as other sources combined. whitney et al., found that inter-individual variation in gene expression profiles was correlated with gender, age, and the time of day at which the sample was taken. these intrinsic differences in expression patterns were likely caused by differences in genotype, although they might also reflect epigenetic or environmental factors. oleksiak et al., in their studies of teleost fish have observed significant differences in gene expression levels between individuals from the same population and between different populations. these differences could be caused by genetic variation as well as other factors, including maternal effects and genotype-environment interactions. on the contrary, dumur et al., found that day-to day variation was the main source of variation. woo et al., in studies of inbred mice strains, detected that most of the genes had small biological variance, but about 10% of genes showed large variation between individuals. we found that technical replicates within a biological replicate had higher and more consistent correlations with each other than with other biological replicates. generally, our correlations were higher than those observed by dobbin et al., for interlaboratory correlations between tumor samples and were compatible with values for in-lab correlations obtained in another study. the consistency of the hybridization step was evaluated using paired t-tests following by modeling of distribution of resulting p-values. the significance depends on the image processing algorithm used: the hybridization effect was not significant for mas and rma, but the proportion of differentially expressed genes was higher than expected by chance for dchip and gcrma-eb. the low-level data were analyzed using four popular methods implemented in the bioconductor package: dchip, mas, rma, and gcrma-eb. we found that different low-level data processing algorithms produced different results. we provide comparisons mainly to illustrate the compatibility of several algorithms. evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of different image processing algorithms may require other experimental settings, such as spike-in data. shedden et al., performed a comprehensive comparison of seven image processing methods for affymetrix arrays and demonstrated that the choice of image processing algorithm has a major impact on the results of microarray data analysis. the authors found that the dchip method operates consistently well, while mas and gcrma-eb consistently performed poorly. gcrma-eb had a particular disagreement with other methods when a t-test was used for group comparison, presumably because it might be more sensitive to the underlying statistical assumptions of a test. similarly, we observed that estimates of the proportion of differentially expressed genes between two technical replicates at the hybridization stage were different than those for data processed with gcrma-eb compared to other methods, which is consistent with finding of shedden et al.. the results presented here are specific for the systems being studied, and other experimental conditions may yield different estimates. for example, we used an outbred strain of rats, which had greater inherent biological variation than inbred strains. in cell cultures of inbred mice strains under otherwise equal conditions, the relative magnitude of biological variation presumably would be smaller. different steps in microarray data analysis, such as normalization, transformation, and gene filtering, may affect results as well. a microarray platform and microarray facility can also have a significant impact, as was demonstrated in several recent studies. testing the influence of these various factors could be an interesting topic of future research.  identification of sources of variation and their relative magnitudes, among other factors, is important for optimal experimental design and the development of quality control procedures. in this study, we evaluated the relative magnitudes of different sources of variation in affymetrix microarray experiments. different image processing algorithms gave different variance components estimates: the greatest source was animal-to-animal variation when dchip and rma were used, and residual error when mas or gcrma-eb were used. we observed that correlations between technical replicates within one biological replicate were consistently higher than between different biological replicates. it should be noted that estimates obtained here were specific for our experimental system, and results would probably change if we used another organism or tissue, or another microarray platform. "," a typical microarray experiment has many sources of variation which can be attributed to biological and technical causes. identifying sources of variation and assessing their magnitude, among other factors, are important for optimal experimental design. the objectives of this study were: to estimate relative magnitudes of different sources of variation and to evaluate agreement between biological and technical replicates.  we performed a microarray experiment using a total of affymetrix genechip® arrays. the study included 4th mammary gland samples from eight 21-day-old sprague dawley cd female rats exposed to genistein. rna samples from each rat were split to assess variation arising at labeling and hybridization steps. a general linear model was used to estimate variance components. pearson correlations were computed to evaluate agreement between technical and biological replicates.  the greatest source of variation was biological variation, followed by residual error, and finally variation due to labeling when *.cel files were processed with dchip and rma image processing algorithms. when mas or gcrma-eb were used, the greatest source of variation was residual error, followed by biology and labeling. correlations between technical replicates were consistently higher than between biological replicates.

128," estimating divergence time of protein sequences is one of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. evolutionary distance estimates are used by many of the most commonly used phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms. in current research, phylogenetic trees are used for many types of subsequent analysis, e.g. orthology inference. early models for sequence evolution focussed on nucleotides. they commonly employ markov chains and assume independent evolution at every site. each of the four nucleotides is identified by one state and the substitution probability is modelled as a state transition probability from one state to another. in the most straightforward approach, the same state transition probability is assigned to every substitution. subsequent models take account of more nucleotide specific properties, e.g. transitional and transversional substitutions as well as gc content. these more advanced approaches are bound to nucleotide sequences and cannot be directly used with protein sequences. markov chain models for protein evolution differ from nucleotide approaches in their larger number of states and transitions for which parameters need to be estimated. the protein sequence jukes-cantor model assigns the same probability to each substitution and is hence a rather poor approximation. this method essentially takes the observed differences between two sequences and corrects this value to the estimated evolutionary distance using a logarithmic function. other similar methods exist that also correct observed differences, e.g. kimura's method. although they produce rather inaccurate distance estimates, correction-based distance estimators are popular because of their simplicity. more advanced protein evolution models estimate parameters from protein sequence alignments. assuming the same substitutions for closely and distantly related sequences leads to the construction of the dayhoff matrix series. following this approach, it suffices to collect data from alignments of closely related sequences to build an evolutionary model of amino acid substitution. dayhoff and co-workers introduced the term percent accepted mutation, which denotes a commonly used measure for evolutionary distance between two aligned sequences. in other words, two sequences at a distance of pam are related to each other by substitutions per position on average. as substitution is a stochastic process, some positions will experience multiple substitutions while others will experience none. it is also possible that secondary substitutions at one site will result in the original residue, making the evolutionary steps invisible. this is in essence the reason why estimating evolutionary distance is so hard – multiple substitutions cannot be observed directly. an evolutionary distance of pam corresponds roughly to 80% observed differences. the term pam is found in literature for both the matrix series given by dayhoff et al. as well as for evolutionary distance unit. in this publication we refer to the matrices as dayhoff matrices and reserve the term pam for distance units. there are two major shortcomings connected with the derivation of the dayhoff matrices. first, potential errors inherent in the experimental data will be magnified by extrapolation. additionally, it is questionable whether substitution probabilities observed on closely related sequences can accurately reflect the evolution of more distantly related sequences. the efforts of researchers since the publication of the dayhoff matrices have led to several other matrix series, sharing the idea of an underlying markov chain. they differ in terms of the data they are built upon and account for the above-mentioned shortcomings in various ways. the approach behind the blosum matrices is different from dayhoff's evolutionary model. whereas the markov model assumes that any transition probability matrix may be derived from another matrix in the same series, the blosum matrices do not imply any evolutionary time. there is no direct mathematical relationship between matrices in the blosum series. sequences with identities above a given identity cutoff are clustered and used to derive score matrices. the blosum matrices are known as a good general-purpose choice. especially, blosum is frequently chosen for the alignment of sequences.  we here introduce scoredist, a novel correction-based distance estimator for protein sequences. it applies a correction function to an observed reduction in normalised score, rather than to observed differences as other correction-based methods. this gives a better estimate of the divergence in the well-established pam measure and allows the popular blosum matrix series to be used. other matrices could in principle be used, but the blosum matrix has proved to be the most universal. scoredist distance estimates are calculated directly by a simple equation and do not require cumbersome computational approximations, which is needed for e.g. maximum likelihood and expected distance estimates. additional calibration opens the possibility to make scoredist tuned to other evolutionary models. in order to evaluate our novel protein distance estimator scoredist against other estimators, we generated a large testset of artificial sequence alignments. simulation is the only way to exactly know an alignment's evolutionary distance. the substitutions were made by rose according to an evolutionary model that can be chosen arbitrarily. it is to be expected that a distance estimator based on a particular evolutionary model will perform optimally on a testset generated with the same model. we therefore generated testsets using four different matrix series: dayhoff, mv, jtt, and wag. for each model, alignments were created for evolutionary distances between and pam units, i.e. alignments for each distance. the scoredist, maximum likelihood, and expected distance estimators can all be tuned towards a particular evolutionary model. we therefore used three evolutionary models which were also used to generate the testsets for these distance estimators, and use a shorthand to refer to these as ""method-model"". for instance, maximum likelihood using the mv model is denoted ml-mv. the jukes-cantor and kimura estimators can not be tuned to a specific model but were tested on all four datasets. the jukes-cantor and kimura correction methods are generally less accurate than scoredist and ml estimators. in some cases they reached higher accuracy than scoredist and ml trained on the ""wrong"" model. for instance, on the dayhoff testset kimura was better than scoredist-mv and ml-mv, and on the mv testset jukes-cantor was better than scoredist and ml trained on dayhoff or jtt. however, jukes-cantor and kimura never came near the scoredist and ml accuracy when trained on the ""right"" model. in a real situation, it is of course not known which evolutionary model is most appropriate. therefore, taking the average rmsd values for each training model reveals the generality and robustness of the method on different testsets. the average accuracy of scoredist is consistently better than for ml, and jukes-cantor and kimura are even further behind. implementation the scoredist estimator was implemented in belvu, which is a general-purpose multiple alignment viewer that allows basic alignment editing. belvu can calculate and display phylogenetic trees. the tree reconstruction can be based on scoredist or other common correction-based distance estimators available within belvu. multiple alignments can be coloured in belvu according to conservation using average blosum score in the column, or by residue-specific colours. user-specified cutoffs can be employed to fine-tune the display. belvu has a range of functions for sorting, colouring, marking up, and printing alignments. in figure the alignment is coloured according to conservation, and sorted according to the tree. the effect of distance correction with scoredist is illustrated. belvu can also be utilised for batch mode operations on the multiple alignment, or for producing distance matrices or phylogenetic trees without graphical output. it is available for the most common unix operating systems and can be obtained from. a windows version exists but is less frequently maintained. see for instructions, and for information on the stockholm format, which is used by the pfam project. discussion our analysis was based on four different evolutionary models – dayhoff, mv, jtt and wag. we chose these because they represent the spectrum of models well. the only tuning done in the scoredist method is the estimation of the calibration factor c. this factor can be seen as a scaling factor for the logarithm base in equation that needs to be set empirically. the difference between scoredist and ml becomes particularly apparent in the mv dataset. there are several hypotheses for this behaviour. the dayhoff matrices were constructed with the limited data available at the time. given the substantial increase of research output in this field particularly during the last decade, it is not surprising that the müller-vingron model reports substantially other results than the dayhoff and jtt matrices. additionally, the calibration factor c can also be interpreted as measure for the similarity of the respective models. following this argument, jtt and dayhoff are more akin given a Δc ≈. the mv model is more distant to both jtt and dayhoff. the expected distance estimator generally overestimates distances. for instance, among dayhoff-calibrated estimators on the mv testset, expected distance is more than pam rmsd units poorer than the best method scoredist. similar values are observed for jtt calibrated estimators. generally, mv-trained estimators are prone to underestimate evolutionary distances. in combination with the ed higher distance estimation, this rather fortuitously leads to good results for ed – mv. however, the scope of this research was to identify a robust method that performs well on various data sources. an estimator which is highly sensitive to the data source or possible incorrect calibration is of less value. the best single estimator was jtt-calibrated scoredist. if the method per se is measured by averaging over all calibrations and testsets, scoredist receives, ed, and ml pam rmsd units. this highlights scoredist as the most robust estimator, with the distance between scoredist and ed being fold the difference between ed and ml. we here only present scoredist results using blosum for calculating the score σ between two sequences. in principle one could use some other score matrix, but we found that this had little effect on the results. since the goal was to make a general-purpose method, blosum was an obvious choice. the key to scoredist is the usage of scores rather than identities, and the choice of somewhat arbitrary parameters is not of primary concern. at present, gaps in the alignments are not included in the scoredist calculation. traditionally, gaps have been difficult to embody in evolutionary models. in the models used here, they are at best crudely modelled by treating every gap equally. an inherent problem is that the probabilities for insertions and deletions are not necessarily synchronized with the substitution probabilities. some protein families are more prone to indels than others, hence it is hard to make a generalizable model that suits all protein types. we have experimented with affine gap penalties in the scoredist method, but this resulted in decreased accuracy. we therefore do not recommend using gaps to estimate protein distances.  we have developed the score matrix based distance estimator scoredist for aligned protein sequences. its main advantages are computational simplicity and high robustness. most other distance estimators produce good results for certain evolutionary models but perform poorly on others. the maximum likelihood and expected distance were found to overfit their estimates to the evolutionary model so much that the results on testsets generated with other models suffered heavily. the correction-based methods jukes-cantor and kimura also favoured a particular evolutionary model, but were not competitively accurate on any testset. it seems that scoredist achieved the best compromise between accuracy and generalization power. "," distance-based methods are popular for reconstructing evolutionary trees thanks to their speed and generality. a number of methods exist for estimating distances from sequence alignments, which often involves some sort of correction for multiple substitutions. the problem is to accurately estimate the number of true substitutions given an observed alignment. so far, the most accurate protein distance estimators have looked for the optimal matrix in a series of transition probability matrices, e.g. the dayhoff series. the evolutionary distance between two aligned sequences is here estimated as the evolutionary distance of the optimal matrix. the optimal matrix can be found either by an iterative search for the maximum likelihood matrix, or by integration to find the expected distance. as a consequence, these methods are more complex to implement and computationally heavier than correction-based methods. another problem is that the result may vary substantially depending on the evolutionary model used for the matrices. an ideal distance estimator should produce consistent and accurate distances independent of the evolutionary model used.  we propose a correction-based protein sequence estimator called scoredist. it uses a logarithmic correction of observed divergence based on the alignment score according to the blosum score matrix. we evaluated scoredist and a number of optimal matrix methods using three evolutionary models for both training and testing dayhoff, jones-taylor-thornton, and müller-vingron, as well as whelan and goldman solely for testing. test alignments with known distances between and substitutions per position were simulated using rose. scoredist proved as accurate as the optimal matrix methods, yet substantially more robust. when trained on one model but tested on another one, scoredist was nearly always more accurate. the jukes-cantor and kimura correction methods were also tested, but were substantially less accurate.  the scoredist distance estimator is fast to implement and run, and combines robustness with accuracy. scoredist has been incorporated into the belvu alignment viewer, which is available at.

129," if we wish to predict the resilience of a species to current challenges, such as those caused by climate change, one important source of information may be the past history of that taxon. a species that has persisted through very long periods – and thus, survived across a wide range of environmental conditions – may be more resilient than a recently evolved taxon whose vulnerability has not yet been tested to the same degree. the age of a species can then be considered as a consequence of resilience, which, in turn, will be determined by specific phenotypic traits. all else being equal then, we might thus expect “older” species to be more resilient. an important question is then what are the factors that affect a species’ age? previous research shows that a species’ geographic location is linked to how long it has persisted since being formed. on average, terrestrial vertebrate species are older in the southern than in the northern hemisphere. the severity of the last glacial maximum was different in these two hemispheres: extensive ice sheets were almost entirely absent from the southern hemisphere, whereas large portions of north america and eurasia were covered by glaciers. these differences placed fewer constraints on organismal viability, enabling populations to persist over extensive areas in the southern hemisphere. as a result, the lack of glaciation reduced the loss of genetic diversity. for similar reasons, the latitudinal distribution of organisms might also impact the age of species. for example, weir and schluter found that within new world birds and mammals, the age of species, as well as the divergence between sister species is older towards the tropics. intrinsic factors might also influence the resilience of species. in particular, it has been proposed that the reproductive strategies and neonatal behaviour, phenotypic characteristics, as well as the presence of intraspecific phenotypic variations, can have an effect on species ages. in this respect, recent studies have shown that intraspecific colour polymorphism allows species to exploit different habitat types or have broader distributions because of potential differences in behaviour, thermoregulation capacities, or prey–predator interactions. in addition, a study strictly focusing on snakes highlighted that the age of colour polymorphic species was older than those of monomorphic taxa. in combination, these results suggest that being colour polymorphic enhances the resilience of species. concerning the reproduction strategies and precociality of neonates, studies on the evolution of viviparity in reptiles suggest that it is a key innovation compared to oviparity, buffering species against the negative impact of past climate fluctuations or enabling them to better exploit cold areas. however, it may also be a dead-end in some circumstances as the transition to viviparity is often irreversible, meaning that cold adapted viviparous species might be at high risk in a context of global warming. lastly, species with independent neonates would be expected to be more resilient. under changing conditions, independent neonates can move by themselves to find a better environment. in contrast, dependent neonates need to be carried during moves, which burdens the parents and lessens their survival rate. any investigation of intrinsic factors associated with species age must also consider the indirect effect of body size. it is well known that body size is correlated with generation time and life history traits, as well as with population density. for example, small-bodied species have been shown to be more resilient than large ones. nonetheless, this factor has been neglected in previous studies looking at the age of species. in the present study, we aim to understand how extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence the resilience of vertebrate taxa and hence their age. based on a dataset of species worldwide and using phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested for an effect of the geographic location, body size, reproduction mode, newborn dependence behaviour, and presence of intraspecific colour polymorphism on the timing of the oldest diversification event within species. our study differs from previous studies by including taxa that are distributed in all areas of the world and we consider in our model all the factors that have been hypothesized to affect the age of species. it is also the first to consider all classes of vertebrates simultaneously and consider for the first time the phylogenetic effects due to shared ancestry between species. it therefore provides a much more complete and clear picture of the factors shaping the resilience of species.  the phylogenetic tree for the vertebrate species was congruent with existing knowledge on the relationships of the taxonomic groups included. most of the nodes were well supported and the trees sampled from the posterior distribution of trees that were used to account for phylogenetic uncertainty showed small differences. the divergence times obtained by maximum likelihood are within the 95 % interval of the posterior samples obtained with beast. the two analyses resulted in very similar divergence times and we therefore use the dates obtained by maximum likelihood for the remaining of the analyses. the dates obtained for the main lineages of vertebrates are also congruent with recent large scale phylogenetic reconstructions. we used phylogenetic gls to test the factors affecting the age of species, which was used as the response variable in our analyses. the backward model selection retained three single factors and one interaction in the final phylogenetic gls model. colour polymorphism and latitude were highly significant, while mode of reproduction was maintained due to its significant interaction with latitude. polymorphic species had a much higher resilience than monomorphic ones and, on average, the age of the polymorphic species was myr older than the age of monomorphic ones. latitude was also significant, but its effect was influenced by the mode of reproduction. oviparous species showed a strong latitudinal trend, with species living far from the equator being younger than species living in tropical climates. in contrast, viviparous species did not show any latitudinal trend in species age.fig. best tree obtained from mrbayes and used for the comparative analyses fig. a distribution of p-values for the different explanatory factors retained in our final model with the age of species as response variable, for trees sampled from the posterior distribution of trees obtained from mrbayes; relationships between the age of species and the presence or absence of intraspecific colour polymorphism and the interaction between the mean latitudinal distribution of species and their reproduction mode discussion our study, based on a dataset of vertebrate species, allowed us to identify several extrinsic and intrinsic factors that influence significantly the age of vertebrate species. it also clarified results from previous studies that were not based on comparative methods, focused on particular taxa or considered fewer factors. overall, absolute mean latitude of the species distribution was negatively correlated with species age and colour-polymorphic species were older than monomorphic species. moreover, the age of oviparous species decreased with latitude, whereas no such pattern was apparent for viviparous ones. the latitudinal gradient found in this study is consistent with the results of weir and schluter, who found that within new world birds and mammals, the age of species, as well as the divergence between sister species, is younger towards the poles. using interspecific divergences, they estimated that the highest recent speciation and extinction rates occurred at high latitudes and declined toward the tropics. this pattern is likely explained by the presence of more stable climatic conditions in the tropics than in temperate areas during pleistocene climatic fluctuations. according to weir and schluter, this climatic stability leads to a lower species turnover in the tropics compared to temperate areas, resulting in a lower diversity in the latter. based on the similarity between our results and those of weir and schluter in term of intraspecific latitudinal gradient, this pattern might be generally valid for vertebrate species from both hemispheres. however, the situation is likely more complex. indeed, the age of viviparous vertebrate species was not influenced by their mean latitudinal distribution, whereas the age of oviparous species decreased towards the poles. this result suggests a higher resilience of viviparous species to cold climate, and can be attributed to their buffering capacity against inadequate environmental conditions during the embryogenesis. this is particularly true for heliothermic vertebrates, for which a cold year might result in an absence of reproduction if favourable nesting sites are absent. in contrast, viviparous species might be able to better deal with poor environmental conditions by modifying their sun-basking activities. for instance, pincheira-donoso et al.,, found that, in a widespread south american lizard genus, the evolution of viviparity was associated with a radiation into cold climates. this argument is not relevant to birds or placental and marsupial mammals because their breeding type is constant and they are more widely distributed. however, the argument can be extended to other ectothermic vertebrates. body colour plays a major role in the evolution of organisms as it is involved, for instance, in thermoregulation, prey–predator interaction, behaviour, protection against uv-light or abrasive agents. therefore, the presence of intraspecific colour polymorphism may promote the ecological success of species as previously shown for squamates, amphibians and owls, through their capacity to exploit a larger range of habitat types. in turn, polymorphic species might be more resilient to past and future climatic fluctuations. our results are also in agreement with the study of pizzatto & dubey, which found that colour-polymorphic snake species were older than monomorphic species. recent studies focusing on temperate vertebrate taxa highlighted that species from the southern hemisphere are older than those from the northern, and that differences in past climate are likely responsible for this pattern. interestingly, the hemisphere of origin is not impacting the age of species in our study, which is likely due to the inclusion of additional intrinsic and extrinsic factors and to the use of phylogenetic comparative methods. indeed, when the hemisphere of origin is included in our analyses without accounting for the phylogenetic relationships between taxa, southern species remained significantly older than northern ones. the same is true when strictly temperate species of our dataset are included. these differences illustrate the importance of considering an array of factors in such analyses. in addition, the phylogenetic relationships of studied taxa might deeply influence such studies, keeping in mind that northern and southern hemisphere temperate fauna are distantly related genetically, numerous families and genera being solely distributed in one of the two hemispheres.  in conclusion, our findings suggest that intrinsic and extrinsic variables might contribute to the resilience of species to past environmental changes and hence are relevant in a context of climate change. overall and independently of current threats, organisms which exhibit ancient intraspecific diversification events are more likely to deal with future modifications of their environment, those species being colour polymorphic, viviparous, or living at low latitudes. "," strong variations are observed between and within taxonomic groups in the age of extant species and these differences can clarify factors that render species more vulnerable to extinction. understanding the factors that influence the resilience of species is thus a key component of evolutionary biology, but it is also of prime importance in a context of climate change and for conservation in general. we explored the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on the timing of the oldest diversification event in over vertebrate species distributed worldwide. we used phylogenetic comparative methods to show that color polymorphism, latitude and reproduction affected the timing of the oldest diversification event within a species.  species from higher latitudes tended to be younger, and colour-polymorphic species were older than monomorphic species. mode of reproduction was important also, in that the age of oviparous species decreased with latitude, whereas no pattern was apparent for viviparous species. organisms which have already persisted for a long time may be more likely to deal with future modifications of their environment.  species that are colour polymorphic, viviparous, and/or live at low latitudes have exhibited resilience to past environmental changes, and hence may be better able to deal with current climate change. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords species ageintraspecific diversificationlatitudeviviparityoviparitycolour polymorphismhttp://dx.doi.org/ /501100001711schweizerischer nationalfonds zur förderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung pz00p3_157244dubey sylvain issue-copyright-statement© the author 2016 ",72087755-1723-40bc-b87e-dbf62c0457db,pubmed
130," genome sequencing projects continue to produce unprecedented amounts of novel protein sequence information, and large-scale experimental efforts are underway to determine the function of the newly discovered proteins. for a majority of proteins it is already possible to predict their approximate function with reasonable accuracy based on their evolutionary relationship or sequence similarity to proteins with known functions. for most recently sequenced bacterial genomes about three quarters of open reading frames can be assigned a possible function in this way. however, a significant number of predicted proteins in each newly sequenced genome have turned out to defy this approach. these proteins, which in extreme cases may constitute up to 50% of open reading frames, show no similarity to proteins of known function. this may be due to missing experimental data, or the proteins are evolving too rapidly or are even unique to a small clade of species. it would be very useful if one could obtain at least a general idea of the function of such proteins based on their amino acid sequence alone. of course this is an extremely challenging task, and one that will only be of limited usefulness without combining it with additional information, but nonetheless several techniques to address this issue have been proposed recently. these publications show that using machine learning classifiers it is possible to predict the function of well-characterized proteins based on features of their amino acid sequence, without using homology information. however, it is unclear if and how well such classifiers would transfer to proteins of unknown function. there are many reasons to assume that these'unknown' proteins are special and differ from well-characterized proteins in significant ways: they may be evolving at a faster pace, they may function in unconventional ways, they may have unusual physico-chemical properties that have made them less accessible to experimentation. if'unknown' proteins are not just a random subset of the proteome, but are biased in such a systematic fashion, classifiers trained and tested on proteins of known function may generalize poorly and will be unable to predict the function of the real proteins of interest. a direct test of the predictive performance on proteins of unknown function is rarely possible, although a recent retrospective study made some first steps in that direction. thus a critical systematic assessment of the general prospect of successful classifier transfer is of great interest. here we show that proteins of known and unknown function do indeed differ significantly. we go on to show that, surprisingly, proteins from different species do also differ, to an even larger extent. we then demonstrate that classifiers do nonetheless generalize across species boundaries and use this to provide the first critical estimate of predictive performance on proteins of unknown function.  we based our analysis on the completed and annotated proteomes of seven bacterial pathogens which cause sexually transmitted diseases in humans. these species cover a wide range of phylogenetic relationships, from closely related species to very divergent ones. on the other hand, they all share the same general ecological niche, thus minimizing confounding effects of divergent evolutionary adaptation. prediction of known protein functions in this paper we are not interested in optimizing a method of predicting protein functions, but rather in evaluating an aspect of function prediction that has been somewhat neglected previously, namely whether classifiers trained on proteins of known functions can be expected to transfer successfully to proteins of unknown function. even an optimal classifier would be useless if it could not be applied reliably to the real proteins of interest, i.e. those for which no function is known at present. however, as a baseline for our study, we first showed that we are able to correctly predict the function of proteins with known function using a support vector machine classifier based on features derived from their amino acid sequence alone. confirming previous results we found that this is indeed possible, although with varying performance for each class and species. only in three highly specialized bacterial species overall performance was hardly better than random, and we will show below how the results of the present work indicate a way to overcome this problem. the observed median auc is 56% averaged across all species and functional classes, and is higher for some important functional classes such as intermediary metabolism, dna metabolism, and transport and binding proteins. these results are equivalent to previously reported accuracies. the generally good performance on such small bacterial genomes is encouraging, especially as it does not rely on the use of posttranslational modification and localization predictions, which are very informative features for eukaryotic proteins. discrimination between'known' and'unknown' proteins previous studies in general stopped at this point and assumed that predictive performance would be maintained when the classifier were applied to proteins of unknown function. we wanted to know if that is a reasonable assumption. to determine the overall similarity of known and unknown proteins in the feature space used for function prediction, we trained another set of svm classifiers to try to distinguish between these two sets of proteins. not unexpectedly we found that they do indeed differ significantly. the possible reason why this is the case lies in the type of unknown proteins. a set of unknown proteins in a species typically contains: • unique proteins – proteins without known homologs • hypothetical proteins – proteins with homologs of unknown function. no experimental evidence exists for the function or existence of the protein product. • wrongly predicted proteins – open reading frames that are not actually expressed, but are only the result of genome misannotation. • special proteins – proteins that have a special feature making them different from known proteins, but which do have a biological function. from the above list, one can see that the set of unknown proteins will contain some members that actually will have a function and others that are probably genome annotation artifacts. the ability to distinguish between known and unknown proteins is most likely due to the difference between unusual unknown proteins and normal known proteins. it is expected that homology-less function prediction will be possible for the'normal' and unknown proteins, while being much more difficult for the special proteins and meaningless for wrongly predicted proteins. therefore, it would be interesting to use the clasification information to estimate the fraction of'predictable' and'unpredictable' proteins in the set of unknown proteins. an exact estimate is not possible, because there is no exact definition of a normal protein available, but we can use the performance of the svm classifier to obtain a rough estimate. the median auc for the discrimination between proteins of known and unknown function is 63%. if we assume that'predictable' unknown proteins are indistinguishable from known proteins, we can calculate the lower bound estimate of the fraction of unpredictable proteins to be 26% /50%). discrimination between proteins from different bacteria to determine if the effect of protein set dissimilarity will be as deleterious as one might fear, we argued that proteins from different species will also show some level of dissimilarity and, hence, one could use the performance of classifers across species boundaries to estimate the transferability from known to unknown proteins. using our taxonomically diverse sample of bacterial species we trained a new set of svm classifiers to try to distinguish between each pair of species. to our great surprise we found that this task is far easier than function prediction or the discrimination of known and unknown proteins. the median auc across all species pairs is an astonishing 85%. this means that given any randomly picked pair of proteins from species a and b, we will be able to assign them to their correct species of origin in 85% of cases. this finding is entirely unexpected, given that the bacteria in our dataset all share the same highly stable ecological niche, the human urogenital tract. while they naturally differ widely in their exact pathophysiology, they would still be expected to carry out the same general biological processes using very similar molecular machinery. the fact that the svm classifiers are nonetheless able to find generally valid species-specific ""sequence signatures"" is of course of great biological interest. one possible explanation for this high accuracy in discriminating proteins from different species lies in the varying levels of guanine-cytosin content in each species. variations in genomic gc content from 25% to 75% have been shown to be common in prokaryotes. variations in gc content in coding sequences will be reflected in differences of amino acid composition, as gc rich codons will be depleted in low-gc species and vice versa. even if this variation is subtle, it will influence classifier performance. classifier transfer between species how then does this high level of dissimilarity between species affect the performance of function prediction classifiers? figure shows that classifiers transfer across species boundaries with surprisingly little loss of accuracy. classifiers that perform well on their species of origin do almost as well on each of the other species. high levels of protein set dissimilarity are apparently tolerated without decreasing performance. a case of special interest is represented by the mycoplasma genomes, where classifiers perform poorly if they are trained on the species itself, and functions are predicted with higher accuracy if the classifier comes from one of the non-mycoplasma species. mycoplasma species are highly derived organisms with extremely reduced minimal genomes and their proteomes may be specifically adapted, e.g. the features used for their svm classifiers differ entirely from those of the other species, but the paradoxical cross-species performance is still difficult to explain by this fact alone.  in conclusion, we find that proteins with known and unknown function differ significantly, but we also find that classifiers transfer very well between different bacterial species which differ even more. viewed optimistically, this means that there is a distinct possibility that function prediction classifiers will generalize successfully to predict the function of proteins of unknown function. figure summarizes the results and can also be used to estimate the performance of classifiers for unknown proteins. in most cases, this performance will be almost as good as that on the known proteins. our findings also indicate that, especially in the case of ""unusual"" proteomes, such as the mycoplasmal examples, it may be a promising strategy to train classifiers on related but more conventional species to achieve the highest predictive performance. "," predicting the function of newly discovered proteins by simply inspecting their amino acid sequence is one of the major challenges of post-genomic computational biology, especially when done without recourse to experimentation or homology information. machine learning classifiers are able to discriminate between proteins belonging to different functional classes. until now, however, it has been unclear if this ability would be transferable to proteins of unknown function, which may show distinct biases compared to experimentally more tractable proteins.  here we show that proteins with known and unknown function do indeed differ significantly. we then show that proteins from different bacterial species also differ to an even larger and very surprising extent, but that functional classifiers nonetheless generalize successfully across species boundaries. we also show that in the case of highly specialized proteomes classifiers from a different, but more conventional, species may in fact outperform the endogenous species-specific classifier.  we conclude that there is very good prospect of successfully predicting the function of yet uncharacterized proteins using machine learning classifiers trained on proteins of known function.

131," high-throughput dna sequencing has increased the number of genome sequences to over bacterial species from which we can infer their proteomes and often major parts of their metabolism and regulatory pathways. a systems level understanding of cells, however, will require the functional characterization of these proteins and how they work together. in recent years, a growing number of efforts have used high throughput assays to catalog gene expression, protein interactions, localization and metabolic activities. for many of these studies, the first step is to identify and then clone all the open reading frames encoded by the genome of the organism. here we describe the construction of a comprehensive escherichia coli orf collection in a gateway® entry vector. the library represents orfs or 94% of all protein-coding genes. the gateway® system facilitates the transfer of orfs into a large range of expression vectors that are suitable for downstream studies. here we demonstrate the utility of the e. coli orfeome by comparing it to other available microbial orfeomes and by testing a set of protein-protein interactions among species. the complete genome sequence of escherichia coli k- encodes protein-coding orfs. kitagawa et al. previously cloned all the e. coli orfs into an expression vector creating n-terminal 6xhis and c-terminal gfp fusions. however, the aska library cannot be used to flexibly transfer orfs into other expression vectors. libraries of all open reading frames cloned into highly flexible vectors will be needed to take full advantage of the information found in any genome sequence. we transferred the aska library into an gateway® entry vector by sfii restriction enzyme cloning. about e. coli clones which were not present in the aska library or which were not successfully cloned from the aska library into the gateway® entry vector were cloned directly by gateway® recombination. the entry clone library was then validated by dna sequencing. the resulting library represents orfs. the clone collection is freely available to academic users. the e. coli entry clone library lacks start and stop codons and is thus compatible with both n-terminal and c-terminal expression clone constructions. the clones from the entry vectors can be easily shuttled into different gateway-compatible expression vectors of many types in a high-throughput fashion.  e. coli as a model for comparative genomics and biology e. coli k- has led basic life science research for more than half a century due to its easy manipulation and its safety as a non-pathogenic organism. we wondered to what extent it can also serve as model for pathogenic bacteria and compared the e. coli orfeome to all other bacterial orfeomes that are available as gateway-compatible clones. figure 1b shows how many e. coli genes have orthologs in these species including vibrio cholerae, yersinia pestis, streptococcus pneumoniae and others. for example, over 80% of e. coli cogs are conserved in pseudomonas aeruginosa. cogs represent conserved protein families and provide a standard way to compare gene sets. we can safely assume that the general molecular function of these e. coli proteins should be similar or identical to these homologues in other bacterial species. however, we cannot easily predict whether small changes in sequence will change the function or specificity of proteins. the availability of complete collections of easily moveable cloned orfs facilitates functional studies in multiple species in parallel, even at the level of whole proteomes. as of today, gateway® clone collections are available for at least bacterial species including strains of staphylococcus aureus. cogs should also facilitate comparative analysis, given that many of them are present in species for which orfeomes are available. for example, cogs are present in at least four of the species for which orfeomes are available. the e. coli orfeome for protein expression we verified the functionality of the entry clones by two different downstream applications. first, we tested recombinant protein production in e. coli by randomly selecting ten entry clones from the library that were subsequently cloned into the gateway® gst-fusion expression vector pdest-gst. the expression clones were transformed into the bl protein expression strain of e. coli and after induction of protein expression with iptg, the cells were lysed in sample buffer and analyzed by western blot. second, we tested protein interactions by the yeast two hybrid assay. about entry clones which are known to be involved in bacterial motility and chemotaxis were cloned into two different yeast two-hybrid expression vector systems and 90× = protein pair were tested for protein-protein interactions, resulting in protein-protein interactions. the e. coli orfeome for functional genomics and protein interaction analysis the availability of orfeome collections will greatly facilitate comparative functional genomic studies. an example of this is to compare protein-protein interactions among multiple species in order to determine which interactions are conserved. here we used the e. coli orf collection as well as previously generated s. aureus and s. pneumoniae collections to systematically test, by yeast two-hybrid, whether the recently described protein-protein interactions between the essential e. coli gene products ygjd, yjee and yeaz are conserved in these gram-positive pathogens. these three proteins were selected as an interesting case study because they are highly conserved, essential, and of unknown function. the yjee, yeaz, and ygjd genes are highly conserved throughout eubacterial genomes while ygjd orthologs are also found throughout the archaea and eukaryotes. we found all the interactions that handford et al. reported but there were significant differences between species. for example, yjee and yeaz from e. coli, but not from s. aureus or s. pneumoniae, interacted. the functions of these genes remain poorly understood. in e. coli, yeaz is able to proteolyse ygjd while yjee, an atpase, competes with ygjd for binding to yeaz. the inability of yjee to interact with yeaz in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae may indicate differences in the regulation of the ygjd-yeaz complex in these species. our study of these interactions not only demonstrated differences between the species tested but also showed another advantage of such a comparative approach: the s. pneumoniae yjee as well as the the s. aureus ygjd protein autoactivated the reporter genes when fused to the gal dna binding domain. this property affects approximately 10% of bait proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays. however, while the s. aureus ygjd bait is autoactivating, ygjd of e. coli and s. pneumoniae are not. hence, comparative assays may offer one strategy for circumventing limitations of the yeast two-hybrid method. additionally, by revealing which interactions are evolutionarily conserved, such comparative studies will greatly enhance our ability to interpret the conserved biological functions of the interacting proteins, and also the computational analysis of high-throughput protein-protein interaction datasets. for example, crystal structures are available for all three interacting proteins, but only one from e. coli, namely yeaz. in order to obtain more information for model building and functional interactions, we expanded our test set beyond e. coli and tested the interactions among ygjd, yeaz, and yjee in five different species, including h. pylori and r. prowazekii. in addition to the expected intraspecies interactions, interspecies interactions were observed. the s. aureus yeaz protein associated with the products of the e. coli and s. pneumoniae orthologs of ygjd while the s. pneumoniae yeaz protein was able to interact with h. pylori ygjd. this last interaction was particularly unexpected as yeaz is not conserved in h. pylori, and suggests the possibility that the functions of yeaz may be performed by another protein in this species. given the availability of orfeomes for more than a dozen species, such comparative analyses can now be carried out quite easily. more importantly, additional biochemical or genetic studies can be done in e. coli for which extensive resources, including deletion strains and comprehensive databases, are available. for instance, our e. coli clones could be used to complement mutants in other species, which would demonstrate their functional equivalence.  in conjunction with other clone sets and the vast amount of genomics and proteomics data from e. coli, the gateway-orfeome will be another highly useful resource for the e. coli functional genomics community. "," systems biology and functional genomics require genome-wide datasets and resources. complete sets of cloned open reading frames have been made for about a dozen bacterial species and allow researchers to express and study complete proteomes in a high-throughput fashion.  we have constructed an open reading frame collection of or 94% of the known escherichia coli k- orfs in gateway® entry vector pentr/zeo. the collection has been used for protein expression and protein interaction studies. for example, we have compared interactions among ygjd, yjee and yeaz proteins in e. coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. we also compare this orfeome with other gateway-compatible bacterial orfeomes and show its utility for comparative functional genomics.  the e. coli orfeome provides a useful resource for functional genomics and other areas of protein research in a highly flexible format. our comparison with other orfeomes makes comparative analyses straighforward and facilitates direct comparisons of many proteins across many genomes.

132," enteropathogenic escherichia coli are an important cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries. the majority of epec isolates belong to classic serotypes derived from classical o serogroups. epec induces attaching and effacing lesions on epithelial cells, characterized by microvilli destruction, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and the formation of a pedestal-like structure at the site of bacterial contact. the a/e genes are localized to the locus for enterocyte effacement and encode intimin, a type iii secretion system, secreted proteins and the translocated intimin receptor. “typical” epec strains contain also the epec adherence factor plasmid, which carries genes encoding a regulator and the bundle-forming pili. epec strains lacking the eaf plasmid have been designated “atypical” epec. recent epidemiological studies indicate that aepec are more prevalent than tepec in both developed and developing countries. some aepec strains are genetically related to the enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and both are considered as emerging pathogens. typical epec strains express only the virulence factors encoded by the lee region and the eaf plasmid, with the exception of the cytolethal distending toxin produced by o86:h strains and the enteroaggregative heat-stable enterotoxin found in o55:h and o127:h strains. in contrast, aepec strains frequently express east and additional virulence factors not encoded by lee region. in a previous study, east was the most frequent virulence factor found in a collection of aepec strains, and was significantly associated with children diarrhea. east1-positive aepec strains have been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea involving children and adults in the united state and japan. however, it is not sufficient to simply probe strains with an asta gene probe due to the existence of east variants. in one study, 100% of the o o o and o157:h enterohemorrhagic e. coli strains examined carried dna sequences homologous to the east gene with two different mutation types. type sheast has nucleotide non-synonymous substitutions including one in the initiation codon;

133," dna packaging in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells is allowed by the assembly of nucleosomal elements, which are composed by a proteic core particle around which dna is wrapped. the nucleosomal core comprises eight histones, short basic proteins characterized by a high content of lysine and arginine. several crystallographic and biochemical studies have shown that histone h2a is able to form a stable complex with histone h2b, while the h monomer can interact with histone h the 3d-structure of histones is characterized by the presence of two or three short alpha-helices flanking a longer helix; each of these helices is typically amphiphilic, and the strong interaction between monomers composing a histone dimer is based on the tight packaging of their hydrophobic surfaces. the histone fold is not a feature specific for eukaryotic histones only; in fact, this fold is also observed in a group of prokaryotic histones, in some transcription factors, and in the amino-terminal domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the sos family. moreover, the crystallographic analysis of the human homologue of sos and of the prokaryotic histone from methanopyrus kandleri showed the presence of two different interacting histone fold motifs localized along the same polypeptidic chain. such a structural arrangement is referred to as ""histone pseudodimer"" or ""double histone fold"". the amino-terminal double histone fold domain of sos proteins is structurally very similar to the h2a-h2b histone dimer, while for the prokaryotic histone pseudodimer it is not possible to individuate a direct structural counterpart in the eukaryotic nucleosome core particle. consequently, no h3-h4-like histone pseudodimer has been characterized so far. prompted by the above observation, we have searched for new sequences potentially compatible with the structure of a putative h3-h histone pseudodimer. the results from this search indicated a viral protein from the heliothis zea virus as a possible h3-h double histone fold containing protein; this structural assignment was validated by using several secondary structure prediction and fold recognition methods. finally, the in silico functional characterization of this histone pseudodimer is reported. methods the initial sequence homology searches were carried out by means of transitive psi-blast analyses. sequence alignments were obtained with clustalw and manually refined. secondary structure predictions were obtained using three different tools: psi-pred, j-pred and phd. meta-predictions were carried out by comparing the results obtained from these three servers, and taking into consideration only the sequence regions that were predicted to assume a particular secondary structure by at least two servers, with a degree of reliability of 50% or higher. fold recognition results were obtained using the 3d-jury meta server. the servers used by 3d-jury for consensus building were: 3d-pssm, meta-basic, ffas, fugue, inub, and mgenthreader. the swiss-model server was used to obtain a 3d-model of the viral histone pseudodimer. the h3-h histone dimer from gallus gallus was chosen as a template. the server generated the model in a fully automatized way, and the reliability of the result from such procedure was checked by means of prochek. the analysis of the model was carried out with pymol and swiss pdb viewer. swiss pdb-viewer was also used in order to obtain the electrostatic potential map of the histone pseudodimer 3d-model. the prediction of dna-binding sites on the h3-h histone pseudodimer model was carried with the pre-ds server.  the viral protein gi| is compatible with a h3-h4-like double histone fold the absence of known h3-h4-like histone pseudodimers in the available structural databases did not allow to apply a standard psi-blast search as a starting point of the present work. consequently, we applied a specific search strategy based on the submission to psi-blast of some ""chimeric"" sequences obtained linking different protein regions included in the h and h monomers of the histone dimer from gallus gallus. in particular, the submission of a query sequence comprising the sequence segments 20– and 40– from histones h and h evidenced the existence of a viral protein from the heliothis zea virus which encompasses two consecutive regions, respectively homologous to histones h and h this protein appeared already at the first iteration, and the corresponding e-value underlines the statistical relevance of the match. the gi| protein includes a long n-terminal module of unknown function, while the regions of homology to histone h and h are localized along the c-terminal part of the aminoacidic sequence. such viral polypeptide is defined as ""histone h h4"" in the corresponding ncbi record; however, this generic annotation is not sufficient to assign a double histone fold domain to this module. actually, the formation of a histone pseudodimer is expected to require a strict conservation of hydrophobic patterns and secondary structure elements on both the histone folds; moreover, the linker region between the two histone folds must be sufficiently long and flexible to allow the assumption of a globular fold. consequently, we decided to carry out an in silico analysis in order to verify if this viral protein sequence is compatible with the presence of a histone pseudodimer. the computational results we obtained have been also used to propose a functional role for this protein module: in fact, viral proteins comprising histone folds are very rare, and no experimental data on them are available at present. the sequence alignment between nucleosomal h and h histones and the c-terminal portion of the viral protein is shown in figure the percentage of identical residues shared by histones h h and the target sequence is % and % respectively. notably, analysis of the alignment highlights a strict conservation of the hydrophobic residues involved in definition of the amphiphilic character of the alpha-helices, which is crucial for the correct folding of double histone fold domains. an analysis based on three different secondary structure prediction servers was then carried out: the results obtained confirmed the structural conservation of the putative alpha-helices corresponding to those normally included in h and h histone folds. moreover, all prediction servers indicated that the linker between the two histone folds in the viral protein is characterized by neither an alpha-helix nor a beta-strand conformation, thus suggesting an extended, random coil conformation for this region; this result was expected because, as mentioned above, in a histone pseudodimer the presence of a flexible spacer is necessary to allow the establishment of intramolecular interactions between the two histone folds. in order to further validate the hypothesis that the two consecutive h and h histone folds can pack against each other giving rise to a histone pseudodimer, we submitted the corresponding sequence region from the viral protein to the fold recognition meta-server 3d-jury. this meta-predictor indicated the structure of the double histone fold domain from methanopyrus kandleri as the most suitable to describe the fold of the query sequence. previous literature data have shown that 3d-jury scores above correspond to correct structure assignment in over 90% of the cases; as for the viral protein gi| the score reported by the algorithm was, well above the threshold that indicates a highly reliable structural assignment. in silico functional characterization of the viral histone pseudodimer double histone fold domains from methanopyrus kandleri and from sos proteins have very different biological roles: in fact, the prokaryotic histone pseudodimer is implicated in chromatin packaging, while sos double histone fold domain is known to exert an inhibitory action towards the ras-gef activity expressed by this protein class; moreover, the cytoplasmic localization of sos proteins indicate that they should not exhibit function of dna-binding factors. the above observations prompted us to carry out an in silico analysis on the novel double histone fold domain from hzv- in order to suggest a possible biological role for this protein module. as a first step, a homology model was built for the viral histone pseudodimer; the structural reliability of the model was checked by using procheck program suite. the calculation of proc-ave parameter, gave a value of, significantly higher then the threshold of - which discriminates between poor and good models. then, we compared the chemical-physical properties of the h3-h histone dimer with those of the histone pseudodimer model. in the h3-h nucleosomal histone dimer, the surface region that mediates protein-dna contacts is dominated by contributions coming from basic aminoacids; as a result, attractive interactions between the histone dimer and deoxyribonucleic acids can take place. the corresponding surface region of the viral histone pseudodimer resulted to be positively charged too, as evidenced in the electrostatic potential map shown in figure 2; moreover, the sequence comparison between histones and the viral double histone fold evidenced that the basic residues directly involved in protein-dna contacts are generally conserved or substituted with other aminoacids that could be involved in dna binding. the availability of a model for the viral double histone fold allowed us to apply a novel and highly reliable computational method for the identification of dna-binding proteins; this method, developed by tsukiya et al., focuses on the shape of the molecular surface of the protein and dna and on the electrostatic potential on the surface; the resulting prediction scheme shows 86% and 96% accuracy for dna-binding and non-dna-binding proteins, respectively. the results obtained from the application of such method were consistent with all the observations above reported: the viral histone pseudodimer was recognized as a dna-binding module, and the surface portion indicated by the algorithm as the dna-binding region on the histone pseudodimer model lies over the conserved basic surface previously described. it is known that some dna-virus genomes are complexed with cellular histones to form a chromatin-like structure inside the virus particle. in view of this observation, and considering the results of the computational study here reported, we hypothesize that the double histone fold domain from hzv could contribute to the packaging and organization of viral dna in the capsid; however, sequence analysis of the viral histone pseudodimer also suggests a possible direct involvement of this protein domain in viral pathogenicity. in fact, the amino-terminal tails of histones h and h have a fundamental role in the modulation of histones-dna interaction; consequently, mutations and deletion in these regions can determine a negative effect on nuclear dna replication and cell cycle progression; notably, these regions are the less conserved in the viral double histone fold sequence, and the expression of such a dna binding domain in cells infected by the hzv- could interfere with physiological processes of crucial importance for cell growth. however, on such basis our hypothesis would remain speculative, and future biochemical studies will thus be required for its validation.  the double histone fold is an all-alpha protein fold characterized by the tight interaction between two distinct histone folds belonging to the same peptide chain. previously, this fold has been recognized only in the guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the sos family and in a few prokaryotic histones. sequence analyses, coupled with results from several secondary structure prediction and fold recognition algorithms, allowed to show that also the viral protein gi| can be included in the group of proteins containing a double histone fold. further structure-function relationship studies revealed that the chemical-physical properties of the viral histone pseudodimer are compatible with dna binding; our in silico results will be helpful in directing targeted biochemical studies aiming at the experimental functional characterization of this interesting viral protein domain. authors' contributions c.g. conceived the idea, carried out the sequence and structure analysis and drafted the manuscript. p.f. provided general guidance in the project. l.d.g. participated in the design of the study and prepared the final version of the paper. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. figures and tables"," histones are short proteins involved in chromatin packaging; in eukaryotes, two h2a-h2b and h3-h histone dimers form the nucleosomal core, which acts as the fundamental dna-packaging element. the double histone fold is a rare globular protein fold in which two consecutive regions characterized by the typical structure of histones assemble together, thus originating a histone pseudodimer. this fold is included in a few prokaryotic histones and in the regulatory region of guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the sos family. for the prokaryotic histones, there is no direct structural counterpart in the nucleosomal core particle, while the pseudodimer from sos proteins is very similar to the dimer formed by histones h2a and h2b  the absence of a h3-h4-like histone pseudodimer in the available structural databases prompted us to search for proteins that could assume such fold. the application of several secondary structure prediction and fold recognition methods allowed to show that the viral protein gi| is compatible with the structure of a h3-h4-like histone pseudodimer. further in silico analyses revealed that this protein module could retain the ability of mediating protein-dna interactions, and could consequently act as a dna-binding domain.  our results suggest a possible functional role in viral pathogenicity for this novel double histone fold domain; thus, the computational analyses here reported will be helpful in directing future biochemical studies on gi| protein. 17– march italian society of bioinformatics: annual meeting milan, italy ",ddb29551-ca96-4168-94a8-e914043d6829,pubmed
134," monte carlo simulation of sequence evolution is routinely used in assessing the performance of phylogenetic inference methods, multiple sequence alignment algorithms and ancestral reconstruction. monte carlo simulation of sequence evolution is also crucially important in the testing of competing evolutionary hypotheses, yet the effect of insertions and deletions is often ignored since the necessary tools were not available. several software packages for simulating basic sequence evolution under popular substitution models have been published in the last decade, for example sdse, seq-gen and the evolver program from the paml package. more recently published software goes beyond the limitations of earlier simulation tools, allowing, for example, the simulation of indel events, sequence regions evolving under different models/parameters, the use of non-homogeneous models allowing for different parameters on different evolutionary lineages and the flexible simulation of genomic features. the r language is the leading open-source environment for statistical computing and graphics, extensively used in bioinformatics data analysis. its use for the analysis of phylogenetic and evolutionary data is aided by the ""analysis of phylogenetics and evolution"" package and a small ecosystem of packages extending its capabilities. the simulation of the evolution of continuous characters is possible using ape and discrete characters can be evolved along a tree according to an arbitrary rate matrix using the phangorn and geiger packages. however, there is no r package currently supporting the simulation of indel events and sequence evolution with site-specific rates, nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios or other advanced features available in other phylogenetics software. allowing for heterogeneous evolution is a fundamental part of virtually all modern phylogenetic analyses and realistic simulation of indel events is indispensable when benchmarking the performance of multiple alignment methods. previous software does not handle indels realistically, posing potential problems for the downstream analyses. most programs assume a uniform distribution of indel events across the simulated biological sequences, despite the fact that those are likely to have regions evolving under different selective constraints. some tools try to address this problem by allowing for partitions evolving under different models/parameters. however, the deletions are often not allowed to cross partition boundaries, which creates an unrealistic ""edge effect"". the correlation between the selective constraints on indels and substitution is another aspect of sequence evolution which cannot be handled properly just by defining partitions. here we present phylosim, an object-oriented framework enabling the realistic monte carlo simulation of sequence evolution. phylosim significantly extends the range of realistic evolutionary patterns that can be simulated, and is freely extensible within the r environment. implementation the phylosim framework - written in pure r - builds on the ape package and aims to complement it. it also uses the r.oo package, which provides class-object-oriented facilities with references on top of the default function-object-oriented framework, and depends on the compoisson and ggplot packages. the released packages are freely available under the gnu general public licence version from cran and the package download page. the package sources are also available from the phylosim github repository.  phylosim uses the gillespie algorithm as a unified framework for simulating substitutions and other events such as insertions and deletions. sequence evolution along a branch is simulated in two steps, iterated repeatedly: sampling the time of occurrence of the next event and then modifying the sequence object according to a randomly selected event. the rate of occurrence of the next event is equal to the sum of all possible event rates, while the event to be performed is selected with a probability proportional to its rate. after performing the event, the set of possible events is updated. these steps are repeated until the available time is exhausted. as in the case of previous software, time is defined in terms of expected substitutions per site and the neutral rates of all other processes are specified relative to that. selective constraints on different types of events can be incorporated in a natural way in the framework described above by accepting/rejecting the selected event with a probability determined by some of its characteristics. the key features offered by phylosim are the following: i. simulation of the evolution of a set of discrete characters with arbitrary states evolving by a continuous-time markov process with an arbitrary rate matrix. ii. explicit implementations of the most popular nucleotide, amino acid and codon substitution models. iii. the possibility to simulate evolution by a combination of substitution processes with arbitrary rate matrices acting on the same site. iv. simulation under the popular models of among-sites rate variation, such as the gamma and invariant sites plus gamma models. v. the possibility to simulate with arbitrarily complex patterns of among-sites rate variation by setting the site-specific rates according to any r expression. vi. simulation with one or more separate insertion and deletion processes acting on the sequences, each sampling indel lengths from an arbitrary discrete distribution or an r expression. vii. all the rate variation features listed above can be readily applied to modify the rates whereby insertion and deletion processes initiate events at given sites. viii. simulation of the effects of spatially variable functional constraints by site- and process-specific insertion and deletion tolerance parameters, which determine the rejection probability of a proposed insertion or deletion; rescaled deletion processes speed up simulation when deletions are strongly selected against. field indel models allow for the fine-grained control of selective constraints on indels and, unlike the partition approach, do not suffer from ""edge effect"" artifacts. ix. the possibility of having different processes and site- and process-specific parameters for every site, which allows for an arbitrary number of partitions in the simulated data. x. simulation of heterotachy and other cases of time-non-homogeneous evolution by allowing the user to set ""node hook"" functions altering sites' properties at internal nodes of the phylogeny. xi. full control over the properties of the inserted sequences, which makes it possible to easily extend phylosim with new kinds of insertion processes,. the validity of the framework has been tested by simulating the evolution of nucleotide, amino acid and codon sequences of increasing length and estimating the value of model parameters and branch lengths from the resulting alignments using the paml package. the results are summarized in appendix a along with the computing time needed for simulation and estimation. implementation using r naturally affects the amount of computing time and memory needed for the simulations, but we believe that this is balanced out by the unparalleled versatility offered by the framework. phylosim is provided with extensive documentation. in addition, a package'vignette' gives a series of examples illustrating the simulation of successively more complex evolutionary scenarios, from very simple and familiar models through to complicated heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics not available with other software. further details of the field deletion models a natural way to incorporate deletions into the gillespie framework is to assign an individual rate to every possible deletion event. modelling in this manner is extremely general but requires a lot of specification: not only individual sites' tolerance to deletion but also of how they interact with neighbouring sites. instead we propose a more restricted ""field model"" of deletion that generalises previous simple approaches to allow the rate at which deletions occur to vary across the sequence but only requires one parameter per site - its deletion tolerance - to be specified. under this model, deletions are proposed in same manner as other events, specifying a rate of occurrence and a distribution of lengths, and then accepted or rejected based on sites they propose to remove. firstly consider only single-site deletions and let each site, i, in the sequence have an associated deletion tolerance parameter, di ∈, representing the probability that it is actually deleted given that a deletion is proposed. sites where di = are deleted at the background rate, sites with di < are deleted more slowly, and sites with di = are never deleted. for proposed deletions that span multiple sites, ℐ, each site is considered independently and the proposed deletion is accepted if and only if every site accepts it: the total probability of acceptance is therefore Πi∈ℐ di. this scheme allows functionally important ""undeletable"" sites and regions to be modelled, as well as the phenomenon of deletion hotspots. it is natural to think of the background rate of deletion as a neutral rate but this is not necessary and can lead to the gillespie algorithm becoming inefficient: for example, an extremely deletion intolerant sequence will reject almost all deletions proposed and so waste many steps. instead we can rescale the process and the deletion tolerances so that deletions are proposed at a rate equal to what would occur if the entire sequence had a deletion tolerance equal to its most tolerant site. an example: annotating a simulated alignment using prank simulating sequence evolution is crucial when benchmarking any method which relies on the heterogeneity of the evolutionary signal in multiple alignments. as an example of a potential use of the phylosim package, we simulated the evolution of a genomic region containing a small gene with two exons, which could be a practical way to assess the sensitivity of the genomic structure model implemented in the prank phylogeny-aware multiple alignment tool. we simulated the evolution of the genomic region along a phylogenetic tree of nine mammal species. for added realism, we included in the simulation features like fixed start codons and splice sites, and a substitution process acting on the three functionally equivalent stop codons. the r script used for the simulation can be found in the examples directory of the package source repository. we used the webprank server to align the simulated sequences, and regarded an alignment position to be annotated as coding if the reported posterior probability of any of the three coding states was greater than. we transferred back the annotation to the ""true"" simulated multiple alignment through the human sequence and compared it to the true structure of the simulated region. we found that the exons inferred by prank show a good overlap with the true simulated exons.  with the features listed above, phylosim permits simulations encompassing a wide range of complexity, from those involving simple indel models similar to tkf to realistic simulations of protein sequences containing domains with distinct characteristics as well as of whole genomic regions harbouring coding sequences with intron-exon structures. extensibility is the most prominent feature of the framework, its design making very simple the implementation of new processes embodying novel events and the adaptation of the simulator to whatever is required. availability

monte carlo simulation of sequence evolution is routinely used to assess the performance of phylogenetic inference methods and sequence alignment algorithms. progress in the field of molecular evolution fuels the need for more realistic and hence more complex simulations, adapted to particular situations, yet current software makes unreasonable assumptions such as homogeneous substitution dynamics or a uniform distribution of indels across the simulated sequences. this calls for an extensible simulation framework written in a high-level functional language, offering new functionality and making it easy to incorporate further complexity.  phylosim is an extensible framework for the monte carlo simulation of sequence evolution, written in r, using the gillespie algorithm to integrate the actions of many concurrent processes such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. uniquely among sequence simulation tools, phylosim can simulate arbitrarily complex patterns of rate variation and multiple indel processes, and allows for the incorporation of selective constraints on indel events. user-defined complex patterns of mutation and selection can be easily integrated into simulations, allowing phylosim to be adapted to specific needs.  close integration with r and the wide range of features implemented offer unmatched flexibility, making it possible to simulate sequence evolution under a wide range of realistic settings. we believe that phylosim will be useful to future studies involving simulated alignments.

135," analgesic drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and local anaesthetic agents are used in dogs as peri- and post-surgery pain relievers. nsaids are used in veterinary medicine for treating especially musculo-skeletal and abdominal pain. these drugs have antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. the common mechanism of action for this class of drugs can be attributed to a blockade of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, resulting from the inhibitionof enzyme cyclooxygenase. meloxicam, belongs to the enolic acid class of nsaids and is also effective as antipyretic, analgesic or anti-inflammatory agent. it preferentially inhibits cox- which is induced by inflammatory stimuli in pathophysiological conditions. mlx is about times more potent at inhibiting cox- than cox- activity. surgery is a duration when there are some major stresses associated with pain, cardiovascular and possibly major haemodynamic changes peri- and post-operation, especially if there is a significant blood loss. in general, the pharmacokinetics of drugs in most species have been characterized in healthy animals. however, the plasma disposition of the active compound and its metabolites may be markedly altered in diseased animals or during peri- or post-operative period. the pharmacokinetics data are available for some nsaids in dogs undergoing surgery and can be compared with other published data. however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the pharmacokinetic disposition of an nsaid in dogs has been evaluated in the same animal with and without surgery. our hypothesis was that surgery alters the plasma disposition of certain drugs including analgesics and anaesthetics administered pre- or peri-operatively. therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of surgery on the plasma disposition of mlx in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy following a single intravenous injection at  mg/kg bodyweight.  clinically no adverse effects were observed during and after the mlx administration in dogs. the pre-operative biochemical and haematological parameters were within the normal ranges. mean age, bodyweight, duration of surgery and the selected surgical variables during anaesthesia are shown in table  the heart rate, respiratory rate and end tidal co values were  ±  beats/min,  ±  breaths/min and  ±   mmhg during anaesthesia, respectively. the albumin levels of each dog in the control group were similar to its own post-surgery plasma albumin concentration. in addition, the mean albumin concentration in the control group was not significantly different compared with that observed in the surgery group.table mean values of general characteristics and selected surgical variables during anaesthesia of eight dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy the analysis yielded linear regression lines ranging from to 10 μg/ml of mlx with a correlation coefficient of. the limits of detection and quantification of the mlx assay were  μg/ml and  μg/ml, respectively. the mean recovery was  % and the accuracy ranged from 96 % to 103 %. pharmacokinetic parameters of mlx following intravenous administration are given in table  semi logarithmic plot of the mean plasma concentration vs. time curves are shown in fig  in additions, the scatter plots of the pharmacokinetic

surgery group fig semi log plot of mean plasma concentrations vs. time curves of meloxicam in control and surgery groups following intravenous administration to bitches fig the scatter plots of some pharmacokinetic parameters in control group vs. surgery group following intravenous administration of meloxicam to dogs the differences in most pharmacokinetic parameters between the control and surgery groups were not significant, however, variability was high for each phase. nevertheless, the terminal half-life and total body clearance values were longer and higher, but the area under the curve value was smaller in the control group compared to the surgery group, respectively. the volume of mlx distribution at steady-state of the control group was significantly larger compared to that of the surgery group. the vdss value of each individual animal decreased in phase i compared with that of the same animals in phase ii. moreover, t1/2λz, auc and mrt values in out of dogs were altered in the post-surgery group compared to the control group. discussion the plasma concentration of mlx in dogs following intravenous administration exhibits slight fluctuations, especially in the early hours of the administration in both phases of the present study. similar observations were also reported by studies performed recently in dogs, cats and horses subjected to ketorolac treatment. the reason of such characteristics in plasma concentrations is not clear and probably not associated with the anaesthetic agents and surgical procedures employed in the experiments, since similar fluctuations were observed in the animals of the control group. there is a reasonable body of literature evaluating peri- or post-operative analgesic effects and plasma dispositions of some nsaids in dogs undergoing surgery. however, to our knowledge this is the first study in which the pharmacokinetics of an nsaid in dogs have been evaluated in the same animal with and without surgery. although, all animals under surgery receive at least drug during the operation for pre-anesthetic medication, anesthesia or analgesia in the surgery unit, there is no information available on the alterations in drug disposition following surgery in veterinary medicine. during the surgery, many hemodynamic and metabolic alterations such as fluctuating hemodynamics, alteration of protein catabolism and anabolism may occur. the changes in circulation, blood volume, extracellular fluid and blood protein levels, such as α1-acid glycoprotein and albumin may affect the distribution of drugs used during the peri- and post-operative periods. the kinetic parameters of mlx observed from the control group in the present study exhibits a low apparent volume of distribution and a long plasma half-life and residence time in dogs following the intravenous administration. these findings are in agreement with the results of a previous study, regarding the values of vss, t1/, mrt and auc in healthy dogs. the differences in most pharmacokinetic parameters between the control and surgery groups were not significant, however, variability was high for each phase. the dogs in the control group were demonstrated to have a prolonged half-life, smaller auc and greater body clearance when compared to themselves in the surgery group. moreover, the volume of mlx distribution at steady-state in the control group was significantly greater than that of the surgery group. volume of distribution is one of the most important parameters for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs and depends on many factors, including the physicochemical properties of the drug, binding strength of plasma proteins, binding capacity to the other tissues. the reason for low levels of vdss measured in surgery group is probably associated with major haemodynamic changes during the surgery and/or drug-drug interaction. the hepatic activity increases during the post-operative period. serum albumin turnover elevates, drug-albumin binding characteristics alter and the level of serum proteins, including albumin decreases dramatically for a period following surgery. in addition, it has been reported that the serum albumin level was significantly reduced in dogs with inflammation compared with the healthy dogs. besides, high plasma albumin binding of mlx could be altered by the anaesthetic drugs, since it has been reported that the plasma proteins decreases in under isoflurane anaesthesia in flying fox. both the duration and the intensity of drug action with the free drug concentration being the active compound are affected by the level of protein binding. in these circumstances, the protein binding is influenced, particularly for the drugs which have more than 90 % protein bound. the protein binding ratio of mlx in dogs was reported as 97 % and mlx exhibits a high degree of binding to albumin. generally, the reduction of plasma protein leads the increase of distribution volume and clearance of drugs via the decrease in the plasma protein bindings. however, the mean albumin concentration in the control group was not significantly different compared with that observed in the surgery group in the present study. consequently, the difference on vdss of mlx is probably not related to the different plasma albumin level between the control and surgery groups. the reason for lower vdss in the surgery group was however unclear. it is probably related to the other factors such as drug-drug interaction which may have changed the drug-protein binding capacity in the surgery group since atropine sulphate, propofol and isoflurane were combinely used for premedication and as anaesthesia. also ovariohysterectomy may have affected reproductive hormones and thus the disposition of the drugs. in addition, the reason for lower vdss in the surgery group could be, at least in part, due to smaller clb and mrt as vdss = clb × mrt. moreover, there was a limitation since the control and surgery phases were arranged in a sequence, but not in a crossover fashion. this experimental design may potentially induce a period effect. however, this is judged to be unlikely as a 10-day washout period was considered to be sufficiently long. in the present study, the effect of surgical operation on the plasma disposition of mlx was investigated in only crossbred and female dogs. however, the plasma disposition of mlx may be different in pure-bred and between male and female dogs. the elimination half-life of naproxen in beagles was much shorter, compared with that of observed in mongrels. this difference probably reflects a breed difference, since it is known that beagles metabolise drugs more rapidly than other breeds. besides, it has been reported that, female dogs showed lower auc and elimination t1/ values of mlx, compared with male dogs.  vdss of mlx in the control group is significantly greater compared to that of the surgery group. generally limited or lowered distribution may decrease the drug exposure into tissues. however, the consequent reduction in volume of distribution leads to higher plasma concentrations of mlx. besides, higher plasma concentration of the increased unbound mlx fraction in plasma may increase risk of side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration, unusual bleeding and loss of kidney function/failure when repeated doses are used. the change in the disposition of some drugs pre-, peri- and post-operatively administered for pre-medication, anaesthesia or prevention of post-operative infections may result in changing efficacy and/or increasing side effects or toxicity. "," meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in the relief of postoperative pain for human and veterinary medicine. this study was designed to investigate the effect of surgery on the plasma disposition of mlx in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy following a single intravenous injection at a dose of  mg/kg bodyweight. eight crossbred bitches were used in the study. a two-phase experimental design with a 10-day washout period was used. pre-operative mlx was administered intravenously to bitches about 10 days before surgery at a dose of  mg/kg bodyweight and peri-operative mlx was administered intravenously after anaesthesia and 15 min before the start of surgery. blood samples were collected from all animals at various times between and 96 h after the drug administrations in both phases. the drug concentrations were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography.  the volume of plasma mlx distribution at steady-state of the control group was significantly greater compared to that of the surgery group. the auc values were higher and the cl values were lower in the surgery group compared to the control group, respectively, but differences were not significant.  the results of the present study indicated that surgery could alter the plasma disposition of mlx and thus the drug efficacy and side effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration, unusual bleeding and loss of kidney function/failure when repeated doses are used. keywords dogmeloxicampharmacokineticssurgeryissue-copyright-statement© the author 2016 ",99043a74-d412-4e06-a5a6-cbb50fa6b399,pubmed

polylinkers are surrounded by adenoviral sequences that allow homologous recombination with adenoviral backbone plasmids in e. coli. the shuttle vectors differ by partly carrying a cytomegalievirus promoter and gfp as a tracer all of which contain a kanamycin resistance gene. therefore, the various components can easily be combined depending on the desired purpose. in this paper we describe a simplified and easy method for screening recombinant dna within the adeasy system. this duplex-pcr-method is independent of the transgene or insert and can be used for the complete adeasy-system. it is characterized by a simple standard protocol and the results can be obtained within a few hours. the pcr is run with two different primer sets. the primers kanafor and kanarev hybridizise with the kanamycin resistence gene and adfor and adrev detect the adenoviral backbone. in case of recombinant clones, two diagnostic fragments with a size of bp and bp are generated. methods the presented duplex-pcr is performed as follows: after co-transformation of the pme i-digested shuttle vector with the adenoviral backbone plasmid to e. coli and plating on agar, half of the overnight grown colonies are picked and used directly as template for the colony-pcr. the other half of the colony is used for inoculation with lb-kanamycin and then incubation at 37°c. only the positive, recombinant clones which have been detected by pcr are grown overnight, a minipreparation of dna is then performed the next morning. the pcr is run using two different primer sets. the primers kanafor and kanarev hybridize to the kanamycin resistence gene and adfor and adrev detect the adenoviral backbone. the optimised concentrations of the components for the duplex-pcr were as follows: mm mgcl mm dntps and units taq polymerase. the bacteria are denatured at 95°c for minutes. the pcr-products are amplified by cycles of annealing at 58°c, extension at 72°c and denaturation at 94°c. in our experience, this procedure produced the best results without generating false positive clones. pcr products are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, half of the reaction volume is size fractionated with v for h in 1% agarose in the presence of ethidium bromide and the resulting bands visualized with ultraviolet illumination. the dna obtained by small scale alkali lysis from the recombinants is then extracted twice with a phenol-chloroform protocol, precipitated and carefully resuspended in μl rnase-free water. the construct is linearized with paci and directly transfected into cells, which are monitored for cytopathic effects, i.e. production of recombinant adenoviruses. the cytopathic effect is usually seen within to days. the expression of the transgene is confirmed by western blot analysis. the practicability of our procedure was verified with three different transgenes: cytosin deaminase, p and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor.  the conventional way of screening for recombinants after co-transformation of the linearized shuttle vector with the adenoviral backbone vector in e. coli is by plating on lb/kanamycin, growing the bacteria overnight, then picking the colonies and growing them again for 10– hours. minipreps are then performed and the size is evaluated on agarose gels. a restriction digest with three different restriction enzymes is then done and finally again another agarose gel is run. this is a relatively time-consuming and laborious procedure, which takes about days. in contrast, the presented alternative protocol allows fast detection of recombinants with a simplified technique by minimizing the amount of necessary steps for generating a recombinant adenovirus. the method is time sparing and cost-effective. in our experience, the above described protocol showed no problems with false negative clones. after optimisation of the pcr protocol, we were able to run the conventional screening method for recombinant clones at the same time as the presented simplified pcr. we found no differences in regard to the final results for the two methods, but it has to be kept in mind that only a limited number of recombinant adenoviruses were actually generated with the new technique. furthermore, we exclusively then continued our work with the adcd-virus. therefore it cannot be ruled out that under other conditions the presented technique may produce other results than the conventional technique. the positive clones were processed and finally transfected into cells. after harvesting recombinant adenovirus, we infected cells with adcd and checked the expression of the cytosin deaminase protein by western blot. the functionality of the gene was proven by facs analysis. we confirmed expression of the protein as well as its functionality.  the presented protocol allows fast detection of recombinant clones within the adeasy system with an easy, cost-effective technique. therefore, this procedure is a potential alternative for screening recombinants within the adeasy system. authors' contributions da designed the study and was responsible for manuscript preparation, mk, ib optimised the pcr protocol, pk was responsible

137," protein localization is a general a term that refers to the study of where proteins are located within the cell. in many cases, proteins cannot perform their designated function until they are transported to the proper location at the appropriate time. improper localization of proteins can exert a significant impact on cellular processes or on the entire organism. therefore, a central issue for biologists is to predict the cellular localization of proteins, which has implications for the functions and interactions of proteins. with the development of new approaches in computer science, coupled with an improved dataset of proteins with known localization, computational tools can now provide fast and accurate localization predictions for many organisms as an alternative to laboratory-based methods. therefore, many studies have begun to address this issue. to predict the cellular localization of proteins, soon after their proposal of a probabilistic classification system to identify e.coli proteins and the yeast proteins, paul horton and kenta nakai also compared their specifically designed probabilistic model with three other classifiers on the same datasets: the k-nearest-neighbor classifier, the binary decision tree classifier, and the naive bayes classifier. the resulting accuracy using stratified cross-validation showed that the knn classifier performed better than the other methods, with an accuracy of approximately 60% for yeast classes and 86% for e. coli classes. feng presented an overview about the prediction of protein subcellular localization, and in donnes and hoglund introduced past and current work on this type of prediction as well as a guideline for future studies. chou and shen summarized the more recent advances in the prediction of protein subcellular localization up to a variety of artificial intelligence technologies have now been developed, including neural networks, the covariant discriminate algorithm, hidden markov models, decision tree and support vector machines. among these methods, the svms are always considered as a powerful algorithm for supervised learning. besides, there are other methods proposed too, like the yloc tool implemented by briesemeister et al. and the prolocalizer which integrated web service to aid the prediction. recently, the random-walk-on-graph technique has been applied to biological questions such as the classification of proteins into functional and structural classes based on their amino acid sequences. weston et al. presented a random-walk kernel based on psi-blast e-values for protein remote homology detection. min et al. applied the convex combination algorithm to approximate the random-walk kernel with optimal random steps and applied this approach to classify protein sequence. freschi et al. proposed a random walk ranking algorithm to predict protein functions from interaction networks. random walks are closely linked to markov chains, which inspired yuan to apply a first-order markov chain and extend the residue pair probability to higher-order models to predict protein subcellular locations. garagea et al. also presented a semi-supervised method for prediction using abstraction augmented markov models. this study introduces a novel random walk method for protein subcellular localization based on amino acid composition. by mapping the protein data into a weighted and partially labeled graph where each node represents a protein sequence, we implemented a random walk classification model to predict labels of unlabeled nodes based on our previous theoretical work. we present an intuitive interpretation of the graph representation, label propagation and model formulation. we additionally analyzed the performance of the method in predicting the cellular localization of proteins. this method produced results that were both competitive and promising when compared to the state-of-the-art svm classifier.  our random walk classifier was coded in matlab. given the training data and their classes, we computed the state matrix y and weight matrix w. in our experiment, the similarity or weight between two nodes was given according to the radius basis function sim=e-γxi-xj2=e-xi-xj22σ to prove the effective classification performance of our method, we compared our classifier with rbf-svm by implementing libsvm, and the γ = 1/2σ of our rawa and rbf-svm was optimized over the interval {2- 2-..., 211}. in this study, we adopted an n-fold cross-validation measurement to produce the highest predication accuracy, which was computed by dividing the number of correctly classified data points by the size of the entire unlabeled dataset. predicting the cellular localization of proteins since our classifier involved two parameters, the laziness parameter α for constructing transition matrix and the random walk step t, we first tested the performance of our classifier on different combinations of α and t. then, under the optimized parameter settings, we compared our approach with various measurements to the svm classifier. influence of α and t we investigated a maximum walk of steps and five parameters:,,, and. figure and figure depict the predictive accuracy curves of our random walk classifier on yeast and gneg datasets, respectively. each figure contains five lines that correspond to each α and depicts the trend of accuracy ratios with increasing t. the test results were obtained from 10-fold cross validation. we found that a large number of steps were unnecessary for the rawa classifier to achieve the best results. first, the complete graph offers each label a chance to reach the unlabeled node in at least one step. second, both figures show that good accuracy was always obtained when the value of t was low. in contrast, the accuracy gradually declines after the peak value of t. this decline may probably due to the fact that with the increasing of t, pt will become trivial and in turn mislead the classification. this situation is quite apparent in figure in addition, szummer and jaakola found that small constant values of t were effective on a dataset with several thousand examples. since the labeled training data is often deterministic, the transition matrix built over the labeled data is commonly treated as a unit matrix in semi-supervised random walk methods. however, the best result for the yeast data was achieved when α =. this value gave the labeled nodes more freedom to move to each other, whereas the best result for the gneg data was achieved when α =. consequently, it is necessary to import the laziness parameter when the training data is not fully reliable; α can usually be set above. comparisons with svm according to the above results, our method achieved a total prediction accuracy of 61% for yeast data, and >93% accuracy for gneg data. furthermore, to quantify the performance of our proposed algorithm, we employed svms and compared the two methods by computing the widely used measures of specificity and sensitivity. table compares the ability of the two methods to classify yeast data into classes, while table shows the comparison for the gneg data with classes. we also compared the total accuracy of both classifiers; these data are presented in the final row of the table. each classifier was able to produce results with high sensitivity and specificity, but neither could identify the proteins that localized to the vac site. the rawa performs slightly better since it could predict the proteins that localized to pox and erl, whereas the svm could not. as illustrated in table both classifiers produced high sensitivities and specificities on the locations, but according to the total accuracy listed in the last row, our classifier outperformed the svm by 1%. we further compared the two classifiers using receiver operating characteristic curves. figure and figure depict the results for yeast and geng, respectively, and each figure contains the roc curve for the rawa method on the left and the roc curve for the svm method on the right. these figures together offer an intuitive comparison and show that our rawa classifier is effective and that the results are comparable to those derived from a svm-based method. discussion herein, we propose a novel classification model for label propagation through random walks on graphs. we first initialized an undirected complete graph over the labeled data whose data points act as the nodes and pairwise distances act as the weights. then, labels and weights are employed to construct the state matrix and state transition matrix so that any node can start a random walk and propagate its label to any unlabeled data point after several steps. this model is also optimized by a kernel method and regularization so as to provide flexible control over the transition matrix. one interesting possibility for future work is to develop algorithms for a clever selection of the labeled dataset and the kernel based on the data. in this study, we used the very simple gaussian kernel with the identity covariance matrix, which likely does not exploit the similarity information conveyed in the data points.  protein cellular and subcellular localization has been an important facet of research because of its role in characterizing protein functions and protein-protein interactions. in this study, we developed a novel approach based on a random walk technique to predict protein localization. we demonstrated that this approach improves the accuracy of predicting protein cellular localization and is easy to train. when compared to the svm classifier, our results are both competitive and promising. "," understanding the localization of proteins in cells is vital to characterizing their functions and possible interactions. as a result, identifying the cellular compartment within which a protein is located becomes an important problem in protein classification. this classification issue thus involves predicting labels in a dataset with a limited number of labeled data points available. by utilizing a graph representation of protein data, random walk techniques have performed well in sequence classification and functional prediction; however, this method has not yet been applied to protein localization. accordingly, we propose a novel classifier in the site prediction of proteins based on random walks on a graph.  we propose a graph theory model for predicting protein localization using data generated in yeast and gram-negative bacteria. we tested the performance of our classifier on the two datasets, optimizing the model training parameters by varying the laziness values and the number of steps taken during the random walk. using 10-fold cross-validation, we achieved an accuracy of above 61% for yeast data and about 93% for gram-negative bacteria.  this study presents a new classifier derived from the random walk technique and applies this classifier to investigate the cellular localization of proteins. the prediction accuracy and additional validation demonstrate an improvement over previous methods, such as support vector machine -based classifiers. 25- july the international conference on intelligent computing huangshan, china ",383ecd61-7692-4ad2-80e4-6894b2ac1b9b,pubmed
138," several inflammatory diseases are characterized by an unbalanced inflammation and an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il- il-17a, il-17c, il- il- il- ifnγ and cxcl especially tnf-α, il-17a and il-12/il- are believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which is confirmed by the successful use of antibodies directed against these cytokines in the treatment of psoriasis. a subset of these cytokines such as tnf-α, il-17c, il- and cxcl2) have also been implicated in sepsis. it has been known for many years that retroviruses are capable of inhibiting proliferation of immune cells upon stimulation. these effects have been localized to the viral fusion protein. expression of such fusion proteins is sufficient to enable allogenic cells to grow into a tumor in immune competent mice. immunosuppressive fusion proteins have been found in a variety of different viruses with type i fusion mechanism such as retroviruses like mpmv and hiv and in filoviruses such as ebola and marburg. this isu-activity was in all these cases located to a very well-defined structure in the transmembrane protein the isu effects range from significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation cytokine skewing, inhibition of monocytic burst, polyclonal b cell activation and cytotoxic t cell activity. peptides spanning the isu domain are as active as the whole protein in these assays but only when presented in a dimeric form or coupled to a carrier protein. such multimeric peptides are capable of reducing or abolishing immune responses like cytokine secretion or proliferation of activated t-cells. the isu-domain has been investigated extensively using a 17-meric peptide derived from murine leukemia virus which shows significant immunosuppressive activity in vitro as described above. the ability of cks- to repress t-cell mediated immune responses makes this peptide an interesting drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. the aim of this study was to verify the in vivo effects of a retrovirally derived cks- peptide on the immune system. we used two known mouse models for skin inflammation: acute allergic contact dermatitis model and tpa toxic eczema model. in both models, the application of the peptide reduced the inflammation induced by the irritants, thereby confirming the viability of utilization of this virus-derived peptide for treatment of inflammatory diseases.  in order to retain the isu-peptide on the ears of the mice for longer periods the dissolved peptide was mixed with natusan®, first touch protection cream at a 1: ratio to create a homogenous solution. all peptides were freshly dissolved at the start of treatments and stored for 4°c during the animal experiments. acute toxic contact eczema model two variants of the tpa-induced acute toxic contact eczema model were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of topical applied cks- peptide. initially, mice were pretreated for 3 days with peptide-containing cream followed by induction of ear inflammation by tpa. figure  2a depicts the time-course. evidently, mice treated with cks- peptide have significantly reduced swelling of the ears upon inflammation induction. the direct comparison with a scrambled peptide in figure  2b points to a specific effect of cks- dimer, which is significantly more potent than the scrambled peptide control to reduce ear inflammation. in the same model an experiment was performed in which inflammation was induced five days prior to treatment with peptide cream. in this setup a monomer peptide vs a dimer was tested since the isu-activity of the peptides are consistently correlated with di- or multimeric forms of the peptides. this was confirmed in a direct comparison experiment, where cks- dimer-containing cream significantly reduced ear inflammation in contrast to the monomeric peptide. figure  3b clearly shows a significant reduction of inflammation two days after cks- dimer treatment in contrast to the monomeric peptide. monomeric peptide was not different from the pure cream vehicle. furthermore, in the same experiment we performed a direct comparison to a potent anti-inflammatory topical glucocorticoid based cream. clobetasol propionate treatment was very potent in this model and reduced inflammation close to the basal level with minimal inter-animal variation. oxazolone-induced murine allergic contact dermatitis this model is representative of allergic contact dermatitis induced inflammation by sensitizing the mice 7 days prior to challenge. three days before induction of inflammation the mice were treated with peptide-containing cream. evidently, as in the tpa-induced eczema model treatment with cks- containing cream lowered swelling of the ears following inflammation induction by oxazolone. however, the effect was less pronounced at day two post oxazolone challenge as shown in the box-plot in figure  4b. in general, this contact dermatitis mouse model induces much less inflammation of the ears in comparison to the tpa mouse model. the results of a total of four independent experiments each with mice pr treatment group are compiled in figure  the figure depicts the relative reduction in ear thickness of the treatment groups compared with tpa or oxazolone alone. across the experiments the reduction in the cks- treatment group ranged from 20-43% with no effect of scrambled/monomer. clobetasol propionate reduced the swelling of the ears by 80% in the single study where it was applied. the consistent reduction of treatment with cks-17-containing cream independent of the model and scheme of application was significantly different from treatment with a scrambled peptide. the impact of cks- treatment on cytokines implicated in inflammatory diseases rna from ear biopsies of the mice treated with tpa was harvested and subjected to mrna relative quantification of il-1α, il- il- il-17c, tnf-α and cxcl all expression levels were adjusted for input mrna by gapdh gene expression and the results normalized to levels for vehicle only treated mice. there was a clear and significant reduction of mrna levels of il-17c, tnf-α, il- and cxcl in mice treated with cks- containing cream. when correlating the relative mrna expression of these cytokines/chemokines to the ear thickness of individual animals, a statistically significant correlation was observed. in turn, expression levels of neither il-1α nor il- were affected by treatment with cks-17-containing cream compared to cream with scrambled peptide. notably, plotting the expression levels of il-1α and il- against the ear thickness revealed no linear correlations where observed. the results are summarized in table  interestingly, treating mouse ears with cream containing cks- peptide results in a potent blockage of tnf-α mrna expression ) to levels below the background in untreated animals in the vehicle control group 1). discussion in this report we have tested the hypothesis that a retrovirus-derived immunosuppressive peptide may reduce inflammation. we found that a topically delivered retroviral derived peptide reduced ear inflammation in two different mouse models. neither a dimeric version of a scrambled isu-peptide nor a monomer of the isu-peptide had any effect, similar to what was previously reported in cell-culture-based assays. the lowering of inflammation in the mouse models can be coupled to significantly reduced expression of key inflammatory cytokines like il- tnf-α and il-17c. these results complement those of cianciolo et al. who recently reported that the cks- isu-peptide or shorter versions thereof had an immunosuppressive effect in mouse models of inflammatory peritonitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. parallel work on hydrophobic regions of hiv- gp both the fusion peptide and the isu domain, has suggested control of t cell activation. a different applicability of modifying the isu-peptide from hiv- was reported by morozov and colleagues who were able to enhance the vaccine induced igg titer towards recombinant gp41. previously, tpa-induced skin inflammation in mice has been shown to involve potent upregulation of tnf-α. here we report that tnf-α expression levels were the most severely affected cytokine level by peptide treatment. despite a four-fold increase in mrna by tpa treatment the application of cks- containing cream reduced tnf-α expression to below baseline levels. in addition, levels of another important regulator in autoimmune diseases, il-17c was significantly reduced upon treatment of inflamed ears with cream containing retroviral peptide. recently, anti-il-17a receptor antibodies have proven successful in early clinical trials. interestingly, we find that the level of il-1α expression is not regulated by cks- peptide application. considering the effect of il-1α in the contact acute eczema model this was somewhat surprising although in agreement with earlier studies of the intrinsic effects of retrovirus-derived envelope peptides highlighting that cks- does not block production of il-1α but reduce the immunobiological effect. the varied effect on several key cytokines suggests that the local application of peptide containing cream pursued in this study could be of greater relevance than systemic use of monoclonal antibodies mainly because of the plethora of targets and the fact that for example anti-tnf-α blockers carry increased infection risks. in the model of oxazolone induced inflammation a similar trend was observed in that ear inflammation was reduced in peptide treated mice. the degree of inflammation induced in this model is of a smaller magnitude. in turn, the relative reduction by peptide treatment was comparable to what was obtained in the tpa-induced model suggesting that the peptide did indeed impact this model as well, although the inhibitory effect failed to reach statistical significance. in this model we have previously shown mitogen-activated protein kinase ap kinase regulated tnf-α as important for ear inflammation.  we have shown that the immunosuppressive retroviral peptide cks- is capable of reducing proinflammatory cytokines as well as the level of inflammation as measured by ear thickness in two mouse models of inflammatory skin disease. together with the work of cianciolo et al. our results indicate that virus-derived immunosuppressive peptides capable of down-regulating several proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il- and il-17c may represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of excess inflammation. "," short dimeric or mulitmeric peptides derived from a highly conserved stretch of amino acids from gammaretroviral envelope proteins has been found to have immunosuppressive properties in vitro. here we test the hypothesis that such immunosuppressive peptides may serve as immunomodulatory reagents for treatment of inflammatory disorders.  the anti-inflammatory effect of a synthetic retrovirus-derived immunosuppressive peptide of amino acids was tested in two murine skin inflammation models, a tpa-induced acute toxic contact eczema model and an oxazolone-induced allergic contact dermatitis. overall, mice treated with a topically applied cream containing the dimeric immunosuppressive peptide exhibited a reduction of % in ear thickness, whereas the application of a scrambled peptide dimer or a monomer of the immunosuppressive peptide remained without effect. furthermore, ear biopsies from mice treated with the dimeric immunosuppressive peptide showed a significant reduction in mrna of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α, il-17c, and il- as well as the chemokine cxcl compared to mice treated with control peptides.  using two murine skin inflammation models, we show that an immunosuppressive retroviral peptide is capable of reducing inflammatory disorders. the results indicate that virus-derived immunosuppressive peptides capable of down-regulating several proinflammatory cytokines may represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of excess inflammation.

139," apc loss causes progenitor expansion in development and disease the wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway acts to maintain the undifferentiated progenitor state in multiple epithelial tissues, and overactivation of this pathway is a major contributor to cancer. the tumor suppressor apc normally functions to inhibit wnt/ß-catenin signaling, and apc mutations are oncogenic in tissues such as the colorectal epithelium. during normal embryonic development, wnt and apc activities are balanced to allow both progenitor cell expansion and differentiation of postmitotic derivatives. zebrafish embryos homozygous for apc mutations exhibit mispatterning and failure of differentiation in multiple tissues including the central nervous system. furthermore, in the cns of other vertebrates, loss of apc function specifically leads to arrest in the neural progenitor state. despite a clear picture of the cellular phenotypes following loss of apc, the molecular pathways underlying cns progenitor cell expansion are largely unknown. these pathways may represent good candidates for mediators of oncogenesis in other epithelial cells. transcriptional targets of wnt signaling mediate apc mutant phenotypes the main downstream output of wnt/ß-catenin signaling is the transcriptional regulation of target genes, mediated by lef/tcf family members. typically, these targets are repressed by lef/tcf factors in the absence of wnt signaling, and following wnt activation ß-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds to lef/tcf proteins and acts as a co-activator. the identification of wnt/ß-catenin transcriptional targets has thus been a major focus of investigation in past studies of the pathway's role in development and disease. some identified target genes have been shown to be common targets in both normal embryos and the oncogenic state. for example, mitf is a direct target of lef during melanocyte specification, and also plays an important role in melanoma progression downstream of wnt pathway hyperactivation. similarly, wnt targets such as ascl and lgr may function in both intestinal epithelium homeostasis as well as colon cancer. stat functions synergistically with wnt signaling in cancer like wnt signaling, the jak/stat pathway has been shown to mediate proliferation and tumor growth in cancer. in particular, constitutive stat activity is associated with malignancy in colon cancer, the primary carcinoma caused by apc mutations. a previous study showed that wnt signaling can stimulate stat activity during early zebrafish development, but the mechanism underlying this activation was not characterized. one potential mechanism of regulation has been suggested by a study in esophageal carcinoma, where stat was shown to be a transcriptional target of ß-catenin via tcf. intriguingly, stat has also been suggested to be a target of wnt signaling in es cells, suggesting that this pathway may represent a developmentally important mechanism. however, the regulatory relationship between wnt signaling and stat activation has not been explored in vivo in untransformed tissue. here we demonstrate that stat is a direct transcriptional target of wnt/ß-catenin signaling in developing zebrafish embryos. we show that increased stat expression in apc mutants correlates with increased proliferation and failure of neuronal differentiation in the developing hypothalamus. conditional inhibition of jak/stat signaling rescues proliferation defects as well as ectopic expression of progenitor markers, but not the general activation of wnt targets or the complete process of neurogenesis. together, these data indicate a specific function for jak/stat activation in mediating neural progenitor expansion downstream of apc mutations, and suggest a conserved role for this pathway in development and disease.  stat is a direct target of the wnt pathway via lef1 we have previously shown that wnt signaling, mediated by the transcriptional effector lef is required for hypothalamic neurogenesis in the zebrafish brain. to identify transcriptional targets of the wnt pathway, we performed chip-seq analysis using a lef antibody. immunoprecipitation was performed using chromatin from whole hours post-fertilization embryos, corresponding with a time of high lef expression in the hypothalamus. after deep sequencing of precipitated chromatin, we observed high enrichment of the stat promoter region compared to total input as well as chromatin from lef deletion mutant embryos. the genomic sequence identified by chip-seq contains several putative lef/tcf consensus binding sites, and we confirmed the direct interaction with lef using chip followed by quantitative pcr. we next tested whether the endogenous expression of stat in the zebrafish embryo depends on wnt-mediated transcription. we used a transgenic inducible repressor of lef/tcf target genes to globally inhibit pathway activity in vivo. hpf embryos were heat shocked for one hour, allowed to recover until hpf, and then processed for in situ hybridization. we observed a qualitative decrease in stat expression throughout embryos expressing Δtcf, including in the hypothalamus. together, these results suggest that stat is a direct transcriptional target of the wnt pathway. stat expression and stat phosphorylation are increased in apc mutants previous studies have reported multiple developmental defects in the cns of apc mutant zebrafish embryos, including axon pathfinding errors, loss of normal brain patterning, and expansion of the putative retinal stem cell zone. an additional striking phenotype that we observed in mutant embryos was a dramatic increase in proliferating cells particularly in the hypothalamus, accompanied by a dramatic decrease in differentiated neurons. an earlier study identified stat as a marker that was increased in apc mutant embryos in the putative retinal stem cell zone and the hypothalamus. we examined stat expression throughout the apc mutant embryo and observed a qualitative increase in mrna levels, with specific enrichment in known cns progenitor zones including the hypothalamus. quantitative pcr analysis of apc mutant embryos showed an increase in the level of stat mrna of ±. fold compared to wild-type siblings. we also found a qualitative increase in pstat immunostaining in the apc mutant hypothalamus compared to control embryos, suggesting that stat mrna levels may normally limit the signaling output of this pathway. based on the known roles of stat function in progenitor cell maintenance, these results raised the possibility that increased jak/stat signaling might underlie some of the progenitor differentiation defects present in the apc mutant brain. increased proliferation in apc mutants can be rescued by blocking jak/stat signaling in other tissues, apc mutations and stat hyperactivation can both lead to increased cell proliferation. to quantify the proliferative increase in apc mutant zebrafish, we performed short-pulse brdu labeling in wild-type and mutant embryos. at hpf, significantly more cells within the developing hypothalamus of apc mutant embryos incorporated brdu than in wild-type siblings. these data are consistent with an increased number of progenitor cells in the cns of apc mutants compared to wild-type embryos. we next tested whether inhibition of jak/stat activity could reverse the increased proliferation found in apc mutants. to block jak/stat signaling, we used the jak inhibitor ag- which has been demonstrated to prevent stat phosphorylation in many other experimental systems including zebrafish and allowed us to bypass early developmental defects resulting from stat knockdown. when wild-type embryos were incubated in 40µm ag- from 24- hpf, we did not observe a significant change in the brdu labeling index compared to untreated controls. in contrast, ag- incubation completely reversed the increase in proliferation observed in apc mutant embryos, restoring the brdu labeling index to wild-type levels. together, these data indicate that jak/stat signaling is required for increased proliferation in apc mutant brains. our observations of increased stat mrna expression in apc mutants suggest that stat levels may be limiting in the developing brain, and that regulation by the wnt pathway may control the ability of jak/stat signaling to drive cell proliferation. increased progenitor marker expression in apc mutants requires jak/stat activity because proliferation is closely linked to the progenitor cell phenotype in the developing cns, we wanted to determine whether other markers of neural progenitors were also increased in apc mutants and whether this increase depends on jak/stat activity. we first examined the expression of ascl1b, which encodes a proneural bhlh transcription factor essential for neurogenesis. using in situ hybridization, we found that ascl1b mrna levels were qualitatively increased in the apc mutant hypothalamus at hpf. incubation in 40µm ag- from 24- hpf was able to eliminate this increase and restore ascl1b expression to wild-type levels in apc mutants, suggesting that increased proneural gene expression is mediated by jak/stat activity. in the zebrafish retina, otx expression marks the putative stem cell zone of the ciliary margin, and is expanded in apc mutants. otx and otx are also expressed in the developing vertebrate hypothalamus and label neural progenitors in the zebrafish hypothalamus. we observed increased otx mrna expression in the hypothalamus of apc mutants, and to provide a more quantitative measurement, we examined the number of cells labeled with an antibody that recognizes both otx and otx within the hypothalamus, apc mutants showed a significant increase in otx1/2-positive cells at hpf, and this increase was rescued to wild-type levels by ag- incubation. these data suggest that cells may be arrested in an otx-positive progenitor state following apc inactivation, and that jak/stat function mediates this arrest. inhibition of jak/stat activity is not sufficient to rescue neurogenesis in apc mutants while jak/stat activity is required for the expansion of cns progenitor characteristics downstream of apc inactivation and stat transcription, we hypothesized that this pathway is not likely to mediate all outputs of wnt activation. indeed, when we examined the expression of the wnt target gene axin we observed a strong increase in mrna expression that was not rescued by ag- incubation. this result indicates that many transcriptional targets of wnt/ß-catenin signaling are likely to be independent of jak/stat activity, and that these targets may act in parallel pathways. furthermore, while ag- incubation could rescue increases in proliferation and progenitor gene expression, it was insufficient to restore neurogenesis in apc mutants. the loss of huc/d expression observed in the hypothalamus was still seen in embryos after incubation in ag-, suggesting that neural progenitors were still unable to differentiate into neurons. therefore, other stat3-independent targets of apc must be important for regulating the full program of differentiation. these could possibly include wnt-independent apc targets, as has been demonstrated previously in other studies.  here we have shown that stat is a direct transcriptional target of wnt signaling in the developing embryo, and that jak/stat signaling mediates the expansion and maintenance of cns progenitor characteristics downstream of wnt hyperactivation in apc mutants. together, our data suggest that transcriptional regulation of stat may represent a general mechanism linking wnt pathway overactivation to the expansion of undifferentiated cells in the disease state. at higher doses of ag- we were able to completely eliminate both proliferation and progenitor marker expression in wild-type embryos. combined with the endogenous expression pattern of stat and the fact that Δtcf can repress stat in wild-type embryos, this suggests that a wnt/stat pathway may also play an important role in normal cns development. "," mutations in apc, a negative regulator of the wnt/ß-catenin pathway, can cause cancer as well as profound developmental defects. in both cases, affected cells adopt a proliferative progenitor state and fail to differentiate. while the upregulation of some target genes of wnt/ß-catenin signaling has been shown to mediate these phenotypes in individual tissues, it is unclear whether a common mechanism underlies the defects in apc mutants.  here we show that stat a known oncogene and a target of ß-catenin in multiple tissues, is upregulated in apc mutant zebrafish embryos. we further demonstrate that jak/stat signaling is necessary for the increased level of proliferation and neural progenitor gene expression observed in apc mutants.  together, our data suggest that the regulation of jak/stat signaling may represent a conserved mechanism explaining the expansion of undifferentiated cells downstream of apc mutations. wntapcstat3progenitorzebrafish ",58a8bdff-c079-4884-8a18-48b7013c0725,pubmed
140," chemical signalling is the most ancient mode of communication and it is still used in some form by all extant organisms. insects, in particular, excel at the production and perception of chemical cues and rank as the best-studied model organisms in chemical ecology. however, despite the ubiquity and importance of chemical communication, there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the specific chemicals involved. the elaborate social systems of ants, for example, are largely regulated by chemical signals, but very little is known about the chemical labels that define colony membership. many insects communicate using a class of chemicals known as cuticular hydrocarbons. although these waxy chemicals probably evolved as barriers to desiccation and microbial infection, they have since gained functions as cues for various types of recognition and communication, including courtship, speciation and parasitism via aggressive chemical mimicry. the chemical cues that regulate membership in insect societies are also believed be cuticular hydrocarbons. in ants, for example, correlative analyses have shown that different colonies have distinctive differences in chc profiles, and some specific chcs have been implicated as candidate recognition cues, based on their association with colony boundaries and colonymate acceptance and rejection behaviours. it is important to note, however, that although correlative approaches have highlighted promising candidate molecules as colony recognition cues, proving that specific compounds are responsible for colonymate discrimination has been very difficult. candidate chemicals for colonymate recognition often occur in small amounts on tiny insects and the biochemical separation of individual compounds can be challenging or, in some cases, impossible. moreover, the overall chc profile can be a complex mixture of tens to hundreds of straight chain alkanes, alkenes and methyl-branched alkanes, and only a small subset of them are likely used as recognition cues. one recent study has suggested a particular dimethyl alkane as one of the colonymate recognition cues in the ant, camponotus herculeanus. beyond this, however, little is known about which particular chcs have been co-opted for colonymate recognition, or how individual social insects discriminate between the cocktails of odours that characterize members of their own colony and those of foreign colonies. for argentine ants, the identification of recognition cues is particularly important because altered social behaviour plays an important role in the ecological success of introduced populations. argentine ants in south america, their native habitat, form colonies that range from a few meters in diameter up to several hundred metres long. these colonies harbour high levels of genetic diversity, are genetically differentiated from each other and exhibit a pattern of genetic isolation by distance. in contrast, introduced populations are genetically depauperate, genetically homogeneous and form geographically vast supercolonies that can extend for thousands of kilometres. experiments both in the laboratory and in the field have shown that this widespread cooperation in introduced populations plays a major role in their ability to displace the native species which, in turn, can lead to negative indirect effects on other native taxa. in this study, we first identified candidate hydrocarbons for colonymate recognition in the argentine ant using several lines of evidence. we then developed and performed new methods for synthesizing seven of these molecules in a pure form. next, we experimentally tested these chemicals for their ability to induce aggression among worker ants from the same colony. finally, we tested the behavioural responses to changes in the quantity of these colonymate recognition cues and how combinations of different synthetic recognition cues affected the expression of aggression toward treated colonymates.  we first identified candidate recognition cues as the long-chain chcs that differed in abundance between agonistic supercolonies. we chose five chcs that differed between colonies for synthesis and behavioural testing and also selected two structurally similar chcs for testing based on ease of synthesis. to test these chemicals as colonymate recognition cues, we developed procedures to synthesize these chcs using a sequence of linear alkyl grignard additions to methyl ketones followed by dehydration and hydrogenation steps to produce the saturated alkanes. we then mixed the synthetic hydrocarbons with chcs extracted from colonymates, applied this mixture to living workers and quantified the behaviour of colonymates toward the treated workers. we also performed two negative controls: the application of colonymate chcs only and the application of colonymate chcs spiked with an alkane which is not present in the argentine ant profiles. we verified the presence and concentration of the synthetic hydrocarbons on the cuticle of treated ants by re-extracting chcs from a subset of the treated ants and analysing their profiles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. as expected, the hydrocarbon profiles of the treated ants revealed that only the targeted hydrocarbon peaks were augmented by the treatment. profiles from control ants did not differ from the profiles of unmanipulated ants. workers treated with synthetic hydrocarbons were attacked by their colonymates more frequently than were the control workers. importantly, the treatments elicited varied responses from different supercolonies. this variation suggests that our synthetic hydrocarbons truly altered colonymate recognition rather than, for example, causing the treated ants to smell like insect prey. instead, the variation in response across colonies suggests that each uses a different subset of hydrocarbons as recognition labels. to test whether larger amounts of the hydrocarbons trigger higher levels of aggression, we tested the response to a fivefold increase in the concentration of 15mec using ants from two of the supercolonies. overall, workers treated with this amount were attacked more frequently than ants treated with the standard concentration, suggesting that the amount of a particular recognition cue can be important for colony-mate recognition. however, when we analysed the results separately for each colony, we found that one of the colonies showed a significantly higher level of aggression toward colonymates treated with the fivefold concentration of 15mec than the standard concentration,, while the other colony did not. these results indicate that the effect of chc concentration on inter-colony aggression most likely depends on the initial chc concentration in the profile of the colonymate. unfortunately, because 15mec co-elutes with other single methyl c35s we are unable to quantify the normally occurring concentrations of this chc in the different colonies. increasing the amount of c fivefold did not trigger aggression. high concentrations of colonymate chc extracts also do not trigger intracolony aggression. colonymates were attacked at even higher rates when a mixture of five different synthetic hydrocarbons were simultaneously applied, each at the same concentration as when applied individually, resulting in a fivefold increase in the total amount applied. when we analysed the results separately for each colony, aggression occurred more frequently towards colonymates with five different synthetic hydrocarbons than control colonymates. thus, both qualitative and quantitative changes to the hydrocarbon profile can trigger aggression among colonymates. our findings advance the understanding of these colonymate recognition systems by providing the first identification, chemical synthesis and behavioural testing of the cues used for argentine ant colonymate recognition. not only does the application of individual synthetic hydrocarbons trigger frequent aggressive rejection of colonymates, but our studies also demonstrate the importance of both qualitative and quantitative changes in chc profiles. in addition to the compounds examined here, it is likely that other chcs are also used as recognition cues. indeed, in our analysis of the natural hydrocarbon variation and aggressive behaviour, other individual chemicals appeared to vary among aggressive colonies, but not among geographically distant sites within the same supercolony. these chcs merit further study. the approach used here could be applied to future studies that seek to clarify the important functional features of these molecules. chemical synthesis and careful testing of related hydrocarbons may provide insights into the mechanisms used to perceive them. for example, synthesis and testing of hydrocarbons that vary only in methyl group number, methyl group location or chain length may reveal which of these features are recognized by various receptor proteins of the chemosensory system. similarly, future studies that couple electrophysiological techniques with the types of approaches used here may reveal how the detection and perception of chemical compounds differs from the behavioural response. our findings suggest potential control strategies for invasive ants based on colony-specific behavioural modification through the use of synthetic recognition cues. since the striking ecological dominance of introduced populations stems from the widespread lack of aggression, synthetic colonymate recognition cues could be used to initiate aggression among nestmates. as this approach would specifically target the social behaviour of only targeted ant species, such control strategies could reduce the harm to non-target organisms caused by the use of general insecticides. however, significant challenges regarding the method and efficacy of chc delivery and potential long-term behavioural responses must first be addressed.  the formation of cooperative colonies underlies the success of social insects generally, and of ants in particular. although it has been well-established that ants can use chcs as the cues for colony membership, the identity of the specific chemicals used has proven elusive. this study provides some of the first insights into the identity of ant colonymate recognition cues and illustrates how both qualitative and quantitative variation in these cues can affect social behaviours. future studies will be able to apply these findings to the exploration of social evolution, sensory ecology, neurophysiology and invasion biology. "," ants form highly social and cooperative colonies that compete, and often fight, against other such colonies, both intra- and interspecifically. some invasive ants take sociality to an extreme, forming geographically massive'supercolonies' across thousands of kilometres. the success of social insects generally, as well as invasive ants in particular, stems from the sophisticated mechanisms used to accurately and precisely distinguish colonymates from non-colonymates. surprisingly, however, the specific chemicals used for this recognition are virtually undescribed.  here, we report the discovery, chemical synthesis and behavioural testing of the colonymate recognition cues used by the widespread and invasive argentine ant. by synthesizing pure versions of these chemicals in the laboratory and testing them in behavioural assays, we show that these compounds trigger aggression among normally amicable nestmates, but control hydrocarbons do not. furthermore, behavioural testing across multiple different supercolonies reveals that the reaction to individual compounds varies from colony to colony -- the expected reaction to true colony recognition labels. our results also show that both quantitative and qualitative changes to cuticular hydrocarbon profiles can trigger aggression among nestmates. these data point the way for the development of new environmentally-friendly control strategies based on the species-specific manipulation of aggressive behaviour.  overall, our findings reveal the identity of specific chemicals used for colonymate recognition by the invasive argentine ants. although the particular chemicals used by other ants may differ, the patterns reported here are likely to be true for ants generally. as almost all invasive ants display widespread unicoloniality in their introduced ranges, our findings are particularly relevant for our understanding of the biology of these damaging invaders.

141," feline herpesvirus, an alphaherpesvirus, is one of the most common viruses among cats. infection is associated with respiratory disorders and ocular disease, including keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal sequestration, keratoconjunctivitis and, ultimately, loss of sight. the severity of clinical symptoms induced by fhv- infection can be reduced by vaccination. however, especially in young kittens that have not yet reached the age of vaccination, but already lost maternal immunity, severe disease may still occur. once these kittens have developed lesions, recurrent disease and virus excretion may occur upon reactivation at later age. in order to control disease in these cases, treatment with an effective antiviral drug would be helpful. several antiviral drugs have already been tested for their efficacy to inhibit fhv- replication by means of a classical plaque number reduction assay. based on the ic or concentration needed to reduce plaque number with %, especially the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate -9-adenine seems very efficient. also, the anp cidofovir as well as the nucleoside analogues ganciclovir, penciclovir, idoxuridine, trifluridine and vidarabine are efficient in reducing the number of fhv-1-induced plaques in vitro. acyclovir and foscarnet, although of proven value against human herpesviruses, have low efficacy against the formation of plaques by fhv-. besides by reducing the number of plaques, as described above, antiviral agents may also exert an effect by reducing the size of herpesvirus-induced plaques. reduction in plaque size may be a potential parameter for the ability of an antiviral agent to restrict the size of macroscopic lesions in vivo. up till now, no studies have addressed the efficacy of antiviral agents to limit the size of fhv-1-induced plaques. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of six antiviral drugs against fhv- in vitro. parameters used to measure efficacy were the ability to limit fhv-1-induced plaque number ) as well as plaque size ) in crandell-rees feline kidney cells.  effect of the antiviral drugs on plaque number no significant variation in plaque number was observed between fhv-1-inoculated cells incubated with various concentrations of roswell park memorial institute - medium and the untreated control. effect of the antiviral drugs on plaque size it is known that marked differences may occur in plaque size when fhv- is grown in vitro. therefore, data obtained in the plaque size assay were subjected to an f-test to examine whether the variation in plaque size between samples was significantly different from the variation in plaque size within a sample. or, in other words, the f-test was used to answer the question whether variation in plaque size was merely an artefact or whether it was related to the use of antiviral drugs. it was found that all antiviral drugs exhibited a significant effect on plaque size. using a post-hoc lsd-test it was demonstrated that the reduction in plaque size was significant for all drugs at all concentrations when compared with the untreated control. the variation in plaque size observed in fhv-1-inoculated cells incubated with various concentrations of rpmi was not significantly different from the variation in plaque size observed in the untreated control. effect of the antiviral drugs on the viability of crfk cells it was found that when crfk cells were cultivated in the presence of 2% rpmi or more, that the relative viability of the cells was significantly lower in comparison with untreated crfk cells incubated with complete medium. in order to determine whether the antiviral products exerted a cytotoxic effect we, therefore, compared the mean relative viability of crfk cells incubated with antiviral products with the mean relative viability of crfk cells incubated with the corresponding concentration of rpmi. acyclovir exerted no significant effect on the viability of crfk cells up till a concentration of μg/ml, ganciclovir up till a concentration of μg/ml, cidofovir up till a concentration of μg/ml, foscarnet up till a concentration of μg/ml, adefovir up till a concentration of μg/ml and pmedap up till a concentration of μg/ml. these concentrations amply exceeded the ic and the ic for all drugs, demonstrating that none of the products were toxic for crfk cells at antiviral concentrations. discussion over the years, an impressive array of antiviral agents has been developed for the treatment of human herpesvirus infections. many of these agents have already been studied for their efficacy against fhv-. in the present study the efficacy of a selection of six antiviral drugs against fhv- was compared in crfk cells using two different parameters, i.e. reduction in plaque number and reduction in plaque size. our study demonstrates that the efficacy of the drugs to reduce the number of plaques can be ranked as follows: ganciclovir → pmedap → cidofovir → adefovir → foscarnet → acyclovir. the results for ganciclovir and cidofovir are similar to those obtained by maggs and clarke, who compared the ability of four antiviral drugs to reduce the number of plaques in crfk cells. they found an ic of μm for ganciclovir and of μm for cidovir. concerning the activity of foscarnet and acyclovir, our results are slightly different from those obtained by maggs and clarke. the latter authors found a lower activity for foscarnet μm or relative antiviral efficacy ) and a higher activity for acyclovir μm or relative antiviral efficacy ). also, other authors obtained variable results on the activity of acyclovir against fhv- with ic values ranging from to μm. a potential explanation for the observed variation may be related to the virus strain. indeed, in a comparative study of nasisse et al., the ic for acyclovir in crfk cells varied almost 2-fold depending on the fhv- strain used. also, there may be inter-test variation involved. while both testing the activity of acyclovir against fhv- strain on crfk cells, nasisse et al. reported a markedly higher ic than maggs and clarke. antiviral agents not only reduce the number of herpesvirus-induced plaques, they also contribute in the reduction of plaque size. our study is the first that addressed the ability of antiviral agents to reduce the size of fhv-1-induced plaques. ranking the drugs following their relative ability to reduce plaque size resulted in cidofovir → ganciclovir → pmedap → adefovir → foscarnet → acyclovir, which is an almost exactly equivalent ranking as that for plaque number data. the latter demonstrates that measuring plaque size is a useful and complementary means of assessing antiviral efficacy. interestingly, for all six drugs it was found that the concentration needed to reduce plaque size was notably lower than that needed to reduce plaque number. the most remarkable effect was observed for cidofovir. its ic was 30-times lower than its ic. for ganciclovir, the ic was 8-times lower. for the other four drugs, a to 5-times lower concentration was required to reduce plaque size with 50% when compared with the ic. the relevance of this finding in view of protection of cats against fhv-1-induced disease remains to be determined. however, as already speculated by mikloska and cunningham, reduction of plaque size in vitro may be a potential parameter for the ability of an antiviral agent to restrict the size of virus-induced lesions in vivo. the ability of adefovir to inhibit fhv- replication was found to differ markedly from pmedap. this seems rather surprising since both drugs, which belong to the class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, are closely related and share a similar antiviral mechanism that relies on the inhibition of viral dna polymerase by the corresponding active diphosphate derivatives. a possible explanation could be a difference in uptake of the drugs by crfk cells. however, kramata and downey found that cellular uptake did not significantly differ between adefovir and pmedap in a human t-lymphoblastoid cell line ccrf-cem. alternatively, viral dna polymerase may have a higher sensitivity for the pmedap diphosphate derivatives than for adefovir diphosphate derivatives, similar as described for cellular dna polymerase. also, there may be a variation in intracellular stability of each drug metabolite as observed for other antiviral drugs. it seems unlikely that the efficiency of phosphorylation by cellular enzymes and, consequently, the amounts of the active diphosphates differ. for both drugs, phosphorylation is catalyzed by mitochondrial and cytosolic isoenzymes of amp kinase. none of the products were toxic for crfk cells at antiviral concentrations. however, the results of the cytotoxicity assay cannot simply be extrapolated to the cat itself, as sensitivity of host cells to a certain drug may differ from those of a continuous cell line. for example, while we were unable to detect a significant effect of cidofovir on the viability of crfk cells up to a concentration of μg/ml, sandmeyer and colleagues reported cytotoxic effects at a concentration of μg/ml in a primary cell culture of feline corneal epithelial cells. also, adefovir exerted no cytotoxic effects in our in vitro study, but when applied in cats for the treatment of feline infectious peritonitis virus or feline leukaemia virus, severe haematological side effects were observed. this highlights the need for extensive safety studies in the cat.  from our study, it can be concluded that measuring reduction in plaque number and plaque size are two valuable and complementary means of assessing the efficacy of an antiviral drug. by using these parameters for six selected antiviral drugs, we found that ganciclovir, pmedap, and cidofovir are most potent inhibitors of fhv- replication in crfk cells. therefore, they may be valuable candidates for the treatment of fhv- infection in cats. "," feline herpesvirus is a common cause of respiratory and ocular disease in cats. especially in young kittens that have not yet reached the age of vaccination, but already lost maternal immunity, severe disease may occur. therefore, there is a need for an effective antiviral treatment. in the present study, the efficacy of six antiviral drugs, i.e. acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, adefovir and 9-- 6-diaminopurine, against fhv- was compared in crandell-rees feline kidney cells using reduction in plaque number and plaque size as parameters.  the capacity to reduce the number of plaques was most pronounced for ganciclovir, pmedap and cidofovir. ic values were μg/ml, μg/ml and μg/ml, respectively. adefovir and foscarnet were intermediately efficient with an ic of μg/ml and μg/ml, respectively. acyclovir was least efficient of μg/ml or μm). all antiviral drugs were able to significantly reduce plaque size when compared with the untreated control. as observed for the reduction in plaque number, ganciclovir, pmedap and cidofovir were most potent in reducing plaque size. ic values were μg/ml, μg/ml and μg/ml, respectively. adefovir and foscarnet were intermediately potent, with an ic of μg/ml and μg/ml, respectively. acyclovir was least potent of μg/ml or μm). the results demonstrate that the ic values were notably lower than the ic values. the most remarkable effect was observed for cidofovir and ganciclovir. none of the products were toxic for crfk cells at antiviral concentrations.  in conclusion, measuring reduction in plaque number and plaque size are two valuable and complementary means of assessing the efficacy of an antiviral drug. by using these parameters for six selected antiviral drugs, we found that ganciclovir, pmedap, and cidofovir are the most potent inhibitors of fhv- replication in crfk cells. therefore, they may be valuable candidates for the treatment of fhv- infection in cats.

142," freezing lesions to the developing cortical plate result in a cascade of local and distal anatomical and physiological changes, including hyperexcitability around the point of disruption, deviation of axonal projections from targets in the hemisphere contralateral to the pathology, and changes in thalamo-cortical connectivity. freezing lesions induced on postnatal day and p in rats resemble human four-layer microgyria. moreover, the presence of microgyria has been associated with rapid auditory processing impairments in rats. given evidence that disruptions in auditory processing may contribute to disruptions in language development, human microgyria could relate to human dyslexia, at least in part, through similar auditory processing disruptions. previous research indicates that injury to developing cortex during peak periods of neuronal migration results in greater decreases in brain weight and cortical volume as compared to injury occurring beyond the cessation of neuronal migration in rats. in fact, focal freezing lesions on p do not lead to significant decreases in brain weight, or cortical volume, nor the formation of four-layer microgyria as seen in p and lesion cases. surprisingly, focal injury on p or does lead to deficits in processing brief gaps in white noise as measured during the juvenile period, regardless of the presence/absence of microgyria or changes in cortical volume/brain weight observed. however, when rapid auditory processing was assessed in adult rats, only subjects with lesions induced on p were found to exhibit persistent rapid auditory processing deficits. these data suggested that despite early behavioral impairments seen with focal lesions on p1- cortical disruption specifically during neuronal migration appears to exert more pronounced and long-term behavioral and neuroanatomical effects as compared to injury occurring after the completion of neuronal migration. in terms of human research, neuromorphometric studies investigating the effects of developmental pathology on long-term behavioral outcome are scarce. however, recent studies suggest a link between early cortical developmental malformations and learning-related cognitive impairments on corpus callosum volume in rats previously assessed for auditory processing, brain weight and cortical volume. we predicted that changes in corpus callosum volume would correspond with the profile of change previously seen for brain weight and cortical volume, and that these changes would in turn reflect long-term behavioral outcome.  post mortem histological analysis revealed no evidence of cortical damage in any of the sham subjects. post mortem analysis showed the presence of double bilateral microgyria only in the p and p lesion groups. the p lesion group, which received comparable freezing lesion treatments relative to the p and p groups, did not show evidence of microgyria. however, the p lesion group did show some disrupted cortical lamination in areas of cortex directly underlying the probe application points. lesions were seen mostly in sensorimotor cortex, with some extension into frontal, temporal, or occipital cortices. the majority of double lesions in p and p conditions appeared as one continuous severe microgyric lesion. however, the p group showed a pattern of disruption that was centered on the specific areas of probe application. this pattern appeared as four relatively small distinct pockets of displaced cortical lamination resulting from the freezing insults. corpus callosum volume a univariate anova was computed for corpus callosum volume, using age at treatment and treatment as fixed factors. results showed a significant main effect of treatment on corpus callosum volume, with lesion subjects showing significantly smaller callosal volumes as compared to shams. an age at treatment × treatment interaction was also found for corpus callosum volume, indicating that corpus callosum volumes were smaller as the age of injury decreased from p to p among lesion subjects, simple effects analyses revealed significant differences between p and p, and p and p, subjects. there was no significant difference between p and p lesion subjects. however, unlike the p lesion group, p subjects did show a significant reduction in corpus callosum volume compared to shams, indicating an overall reduction in corpus callosum volume similar to, but not as great as, the reduction seen in the p lesion condition. discussion the current findings show that focal bilateral freezing lesions to the developing cortex result in differential reductions in corpus callosum volume as a function of the timing of the insult. results show an age of treatment by treatment interaction, indicating that as the age at injury moves from p to p the corpus callosum becomes smaller. this progressive decrease in corpus callosum volume is evidenced by smaller callosal volumes in p versus p lesion, and p lesion versus sham subjects. although the cause of these changes is unknown, the current results add to previous studies showing reduced cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity, along with reductions in cortical volume and brain weight, resulting from p lesion-induced microgyria. as previously reported for the subjects in the current analysis, brain weight and cortical volume decrease as a function of the age at which injury occurs. specifically, p induced lesion subjects had the smallest cortex and brain weight compared to shams, followed by p and then the p lesion group. all of these data taken together suggest that changes in corpus callosum volume, in addition to cortical volume and brain weight, may represent an important clinical marker for the timing of cortical developmental pathology, which may contribute to some aspects of learning impairment. moreover, the current report provides increased support for the hypothesis that early injury to developing cortex can have marked effects on the volume of various structures directly and indirectly related to the point of disruption. we previously reported that p focal injury to cortex led to long-term impairment in processing short but not long duration gaps in white noise using a startle response paradigm. further, prior to the current analysis all subjects received a total of days of silent gap/reflex modification testing. during the juvenile period, all subjects in the current brain assessment received days of silent gap testing, in addition to days of silent gap testing in adulthood. briefly, acoustic testing involved the placement of rats on a load cell platform while a pseudo randomized set of variable duration silent gaps was presented in continuous db broadband white noise prior to a db startle eliciting noise burst. detection of the silent gap cue elicited a reduction in the startle response relative to an uncued trial, where no gap preceded the startle burst. importantly, subjects with the largest reduction in corpus callosum volume, as seen in the current analysis, showed the worst long-term behavioral outcome. specifically, p lesion subjects continued to show impairments in 2– ms silent gap detection after p whereas p and p lesion groups no longer showed the robust pattern of impairment. it is important to note that all of the subjects evaluated in the current study received the same testing experience prior to sacrifice. further, the nature of reflex modification insured that alternative strategies could not be used as with more complex maze learning or operant conditioning tasks. while the possibility exists that behavioral testing effected the brains of the three lesion groups or shams differently, the fact that p and sham subjects did not differ in corpus callosum volume suggests that age at injury was an important factor in determining long-term neuromorphological profiles across groups. further, even with repeated behavioral testing these results are especially important within the clinical context. however, future studies will seek to determine the effects of different types of experience on key anatomical markers, such as corpus callosum volume. although the results of the current study do not address the causal mechanisms underlying auditory processing impairments, they may represent an additional marker for the presence of developmental pathology which might be involved in the appearance of human learning impairments such as dyslexia,, as well as cortical developmental malformations. in recent years, as neuroimaging has become more accessible to researchers, the corpus callosum has gained increased attention as a target for possible pathology underlying developmental learning impairments. however, sampling in these studies is frequently limited to young adults and there is often little information regarding the timing or occurrence of pre/pari natal insults. therefore, the use of rodent models of focal cortical injury such as the one presented here may help identify possible windows during brain development at which particular structures are more susceptible to degradation, which in turn could lead to more pronounced long term behavioral pathology. the present data supports the notion that assessment of colossal morphology in populations at risk for neurodevelopmental pathologies, may help identify whether and when injury occurred, as well as predict potential long-term behavioral outcomes.  the reductions in corpus callosum volume in the p and lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in brain weight and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats. current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments, compared with injury that occurs later in development. further, these results suggest that in a human clinical setting decreased corpus callosum volume may represent an additional marker for long-term behavioral outcome. "," freezing lesions to developing rat cortex induced between postnatal day one and three lead to malformations similar to human microgyria, and further correspond to reductions in brain weight and cortical volume. in contrast, comparable lesions on p do not produce microgyric malformations, nor the changes in brain weight seen with microgyria. however, injury occurring at all three ages does lead to rapid auditory processing deficits as measured in the juvenile period. interestingly, these deficits persist into adulthood only in the p lesion case. given prior evidence that early focal cortical lesions induce abnormalities in cortical morphology and connectivity, we hypothesized that the differential behavioral effects of focal cortical lesions on p p or p may be associated with underlying neuroanatomical changes that are sensitive to timing of injury. clinical studies indicate that humans with perinatal brain injury often show regional reductions in corpus callosum size and abnormal symmetry, which frequently correspond to learning impairments. therefore, in the current study the brains of p or lesion rats, previously evaluated for brain weight, and cortical volume changes and auditory processing impairments, were further analyzed for changes in corpus callosum volume.  results showed a significant main effect of treatment on corpus callosum volume, with lesion subjects showing significantly smaller callosal volumes as compared to shams. an age at treatment × treatment interaction, indicated that corpus callosum size decreased as the age of injury decreased from p to p simple effects analysis showed significant differences between p and p, and p and p, subjects. rats with p injury resulting in microgyria had the greatest reduction in corpus callosum volume, followed by the p group, which showed a significant reduction in corpus callosum volume compared to shams. finally, the p lesion group did not significantly differ from the sham subjects in callosal volume.  decrements in corpus callosum volume in the p and lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in brain weight and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats. current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments, compared with injury that occurs later in development. further, these results suggest that in a human clinical setting decreased corpus callosum volume may represent an additional marker for long-term behavioral outcome.

143," antimicrobial peptides are widely distributed in nature and play a critical role in the innate immunity of host defense systems. they act with broad spectrum and, hence, are promising candidates for therapeutic and industrial application. for research studies and clinical trials, large quantities of these peptides are needed. the number of described amps has increased over recent decades; however, the recent generation of huge amounts of genomic, proteomic and est data enables novel strategies for the discovery of new candidate amps. in silico methods based on bioinformatic analyses, combined with experimental screening techniques have been developed to screen and identify new amp genes from huge ""-omics"" data sets. belarmino et al. screened ests of sugarcane using a computational approach and successfully identified new defensin isoforms. following in silico prediction, however, there is a requirement for a high throughput genome-scale dna cloning and expression system to enable the antimicrobial activities of putative amps to be characterized. expression of fusion proteins that form inclusion bodies has several advantages that can overcome major barriers of amp expression in e. coli: high rates of expression, easy collection by centrifugation, protection from proteolysis and the avoidance of intrinsic amp antimicrobial activity against host cells. however, recombinant amps expressed in e. coli often include 1- non-native amino acid residuals at the n terminus of the target protein due to a specific linker sequence recognized by endoproteases or chemical agents, typically located between the native protein sequence and the tag. these non-authentic n termini of amps often alter their characteristics. it is, therefore, very important to develop a new strategy for authentic recombinant amp expression. the n-terminal autoprotease, npro, of classical swine fever virus cleaves itself between the c-terminal cys and position, which represent the authentic n-terminal amino acid of the target protein. it is also a relatively hydrophobic protein that tends to form insoluble aggregates on refolding, preventing autoproteolysis. in this approach, the target protein is fused to the c-terminus of npro and is expressed in inclusion bodies. after inclusion bodies are isolated, an in vitro refolding step is necessary to induce autoproteolysis, and render the amps biologically active. importantly, cleavage does not need to be initiated by the use of reducing agents or by temperature and ph shifts. eddie, a mutant of npro, shows improved solubility and faster refolding and cleavage than wild-type npro. in our previous work, the fusion protein eddie-cad was successfully expressed in e. coli after codon optimization and the purified recombinant mature cecropin ad was fully bioactive. the in vitro cloning of dna molecules traditionally uses pcr or site-specific restriction endonucleases to generate linear dna inserts with defined termini and requires dna ligase to covalently join these inserts to vectors with the corresponding ends. however, restriction endonuclease sites often introduce a few amino acids to the n-terminus of mature peptides, and it is very difficult to analyze recombinant clones when the insert dna fragment is very short. for high throughput subcloning of short peptide genes, we constructed the vector, pet30a/his-eddie-gfp, and used a seamless enzyme-free cloning method for high level expression of amps in e. coli, this method allows one-step assembly of dna fragments in vivo via homologous recombination in e. coli. for high level expression, codon usages of synthesized amp genes were optimized according to the host strains. for efficient analysis of short insert dna fragments, the recombinants were easily screened by gfp green/white colony selection. in this article, our approach was validated using target amps of variable length.  construction of his-eddie-gfp fusion expression plasmid the construction of the pet30a/his-eddie-gfp vector was based on pet30a/his- eddie-cad. after pcr amplification, the gfp fragment was successfully subcloned into pet30a/his-eddie-cad. colonies showing green fluorescence were picked and pcr amplification of the gfp gene followed by gel electrophoresis showed that the gfp fragment had been successfully inserted into the expression vector. dna sequencing validated that the gfp gene was inserted downstream of the eddie gene. construction of the his-eddie-amp fusion expression plasmid to clone amp genes in a high-throughput manner, we performed a green/white colony screen using the gfp in pet30a/his-eddie-gfp. after a target gene is cloned into the vector by a one-step pcr technique, the gfp gene is destroyed; therefore, green fluorescence indicates non-linearized parental vector. four amp genes, temporin g, hexapeptide, combi- and histatin were amplified and cloned downstream of eddie using a one-step pcr process, and then transformed into e. coli cells. blp- and histatin genes were assembled using four primers in one pcr reaction, respectively. pet30a/his-eddie-gfp was replicated at the same time. the two pcr products were then transformed into e. coli cells together. the transformants were screened under ultraviolet light, and the white colonies were further screened by pcr verification and sequencing. the recombinant pet30a/his-eddie-amp plasmid is smaller than the parental pet30a/his-eddie-gfp plasmid, which makes it very easy to distinguish the two plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis. expression and purification of fusion proteins e. coli bl cells harboring pet30a/his-eddie-amp were induced by iptg, and the expression of his-eddie-amp proteins was analyzed by sds-page. fusion proteins of kda represented the majority of the insoluble components in cell lysates. the recombinant his-eddie-amps were estimated to constitute about 40% of the total protein present in cells. the yield of inclusion bodies was quite high due to the properties of the fusion partner. refolding and activity analysis purified his-eddie-amp inclusion bodies were diluted in optimized refolding buffer and incubated to enable self-cleavage to occur. to examine the antimicrobial activity of six recombinant amps, the purified supernatants were assayed using a radial diffusion assay. as shown in figure there were large halos around the six amps, indicating that all six amps had specific bactericidal activities against e. coli atcc m. luteus or s. cerevisiae. no inhibition zones were seen around the negative control spots. the recombinant amps were clearly bioactive and very effective in killing these sensitive strains. discussion we have described a new method for cloning and expressing amp genes. the desired amps are amplified using orf-specific primers with flanking sequences identical to the two ends of a linearized vector. the pcr product and the linearized vector are then cotransformed into e. coli cells, where the orf is incorporated into the vector in vivo. short amps can even directly incorporate into the linearized vector through self-ligation. unlike conventional methods that use restriction enzymes or site-specific recombinases, pcr products could be seamlessly assembled without the need for specific sequences for ligation or site-specific recombination. this system is more efficient than cloning methods requiring ligase and will be useful for standard dna cloning and for constructing genome-scale clone resources that facilitate functional analysis. most amp genes are very small and it is difficult to identify recombinant plasmids containing these genes. we, therefore, incorporated the gfp reporter gene into the expression vector to enable convenient recombinant colony picking. amps expressed as npro fusions are deposited as insoluble proteins in inclusion bodies. this greatly increases yield due to resistance to proteolytic degradation. during refolding in vitro, eddie self-cleaved at the specific site and the six target peptides were released. our construct also encodes the affinity tag, preceding the coding regions of eddie, to enable fast and straightforward purification using ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography after refolding. the target peptides could be easily purified to homogeneity. these results validated this high throughput amp subcloning method. using this method, we successfully cloned peptides into the expression vector and identified about new amps from brassica napus cdna libraries that showed antimicrobial activities. this approach, combined with bioinformatic analyses of genome and est sequence data, will be useful in screening for new amps.  in conclusion, this is a simple, reliable, automated, robust, flexible and low-cost expression cloning approach in which pcr fragments are fused into an expression vector without unwanted amino acids. this strategy advances the methodologies available for amp prokaryote expression. the main barriers to amp expression, such as, codon preference, the intrinsic antimicrobial activity of amps to host cells, and inefficient production of amps owing to proteolytic degradation, are overcome by this expression system. "," to facilitate the screening of large quantities of new antimicrobial peptides, we describe a cost-effective method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of amps. eddie, an autoproteolytic mutant of the n-terminal autoprotease, npro, from classical swine fever virus, was selected as a fusion protein partner. the expression system was used for high-level expression of six antimicrobial peptides with different sizes: bombinin-like peptide temporin g, hexapeptide, combi- human histatin and human histatin these expressed amps were purified and evaluated for antimicrobial activity.  two or four primers were used to synthesize each amp gene in a single step pcr. each synthetic gene was then cloned into the pet30a/his-eddie-gfp vector via an in vivo recombination strategy. each amp was then expressed as an npro fusion protein in escherichia coli. the expressed fusion proteins existed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and the expression levels of the six amps reached up to 40% of the total cell protein content. on in vitro refolding, the fusion amps was released from the c-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving amps with an authentic n terminus. the released fusion partner was easily purified by ni-nta chromatography. all recombinant amps displayed expected antimicrobial activity against e. coli, micrococcus luteus and s. cerevisia.  the method described in this report allows the fast synthesis of genes that are optimized for over-expression in e. coli and for the production of sufficiently large amounts of peptides for functional and structural characterization. the npro partner system, without the need for chemical or enzymatic removal of the fusion tag, is a low-cost, efficient way of producing amps for characterization. the cloning method, combined with bioinformatic analyses from genome and est sequence data, will also be useful for screening new amps. plasmid pet30a/his-eddie-gfp also provides green/white colony selection for high-throughput recombinant amp cloning. antimicrobial peptidehigh throughputnproprokaryotic expression ",22e2e9ef-c515-4f2c-89a2-8e5d8792a530,pubmed
144," in recent years there has been an increasing amount of experimental evidence pointing out the abundance of protein disorder within the living world. recent computational studies have shown that the frequency and length of disordered regions increases with increasing organism complexity, with as much as one third of eukaryotic proteins containing long intrinsically disordered regions and 12% of them being fully disordered. the identification of disordered regions has a practical interest. disordered regions often have a biased amino acid composition that can lead to spurious sequence similarity with unrelated proteins. the recognition of regions of disorder is thus crucial to avoid spurious sequence alignments with sequences of unrelated, structured proteins. secondly, the recognition of disordered regions facilitates the identification of eukaryotic linear motifs, which are short functional motifs occurring mainly within disordered regions, and the functional annotation of proteins. last, but not least, disordered regions often prevent crystallization of proteins, or the generation of interpretable nmr data and thus represent a bottleneck in high throughput structural determination. as such, their identification is instrumental for delineating protein domains amenable to crystallization and/or to dissect target sequences into a set of independently folded domains in order to facilitate tertiary structure and threading predictions. intrinsically disordered proteins possess distinctive sequence features, including paucity of hydrophobic residues and enrichment in hydrophilic residues, which allow them to be predicted with a rather good accuracy. based on these peculiar sequence properties, a series of predictors have been developed in the last years, the majority of which are available on the web. as different ""flavors"" of disorder exist, a given predictor may be more performant in detecting a given ""flavor"" of disorder against which it has been trained. hence, the reliability of disorder prediction benefits from the use of several methods relying on different concepts or different physico-chemical parameters. indeed, we have previously shown that predictions good enough to decipher the modular organization of a protein can only be obtained by combining various predictors. however this is very time-consuming, since multiple predictions have to be carried out, individual outputs have to be retrieved, compared to each other and a comprehensive view of the results can only be obtained through a manual, fastidious, non-automated procedure. this prompted us to develop medor, which is a tool for speeding up the analysis of protein disorder thanks to the simultaneous submission and retrieval of multiple disorder predictions. implementation medor is a java application that provides a graphical output summarizing the predictions of the following programs: a secondary structure prediction, based on the strbiolib library of the pred2ary program, hydrophobic cluster analysis, iupred, prelink, ronn, foldunfold, disembl, foldindex, globplot, disprot vl and vl3h, disprot vsl2b and phobius. ssp and hca have been included in the medor program and do not require a web connection. for predictors remotely launched through connection to the public web servers, we selected predictors that rely on different physico-chemical principles, return results online with a delay compatible with the interactive character of the tool, and do not require an e-mail address. additional predictors could be nevertheless easily implemented in medor in the future. of the three predictions provided by disembl, only rem provides disorder predictions and is therefore run by default. the two other disembl predictions, i.e. ""loops"" and ""hot loops"", can be optionally selected from the medor input frame. these latter are indeed useful in terms of identification of regions devoid of regular secondary structure. as such, they are complementary to ssp, with the ""hot loops"" prediction providing in addition information on the extent of thermal agitation. all requests are submitted in parallel by launching multiple predictors and using default parameters. retrieval of results is fast, as it takes at maximum the time required by the slowest predictor to reply plus the connection time to the server. ssp in medor is run using the medium jury of pred2ary, which provides a good compromise between accuracy and rapidity. hca makes use of a two-dimensional helical representation of protein sequences, and thus it is not stricto sensu a predictor. in hca plots, disordered regions are recognizable as they are depleted in hydrophobic clusters. for predictors that provide boundaries between ordered and disordered regions, these latter are directly extracted from the outputs. for predictors that provide only disorder probabilities, medor applies a 50% cutoff to assign disorder. beyond disorder predictors, the phobius program, which predicts transmembrane domains and signal peptides, can also be optionally selected from the medor input frame.  program input the input format is a single protein amino acid sequence in either plain text or fasta. the input window allows selection of the predictors to be run and choice of the timeout, which can be set in the range of second to minutes. program output medor provides a graphical output, in which the sequence query and the results of the various predictors are featured horizontally, with a scroll bar allowing progression from the n-terminus to the c-terminus. all predictions are drawn along the sequence that is represented as a single, continuous horizontal line. whenever provided by the disorder predictors, per residue probabilities are included in the medor output and shown in the status bar. the graphical output is a dynamic interface that can be customized. it allows the user to display a graphical repository line for comparison among different predictions, to highlight zones of interest, to retrieve sequence boundaries for each prediction and to extract parts of sequences corresponding to a prediction or a highlighted area. the main menu of the graphical output gives access to several functions, such as focus in and out, display/hide the left description labels or the results of any of the predictors, select the highlight color, and display/hide the comment panel. this latter allows insertion of a text/comment in the rich text format. this main menu also contains options for printing the graphic output, for saving it either as a png image or as an xlm-based file format specific to medor. the «load» function from the input window menu of medor allows the user to load a file in the "".med"" format. the whole medor functionalities are described in the associated help file.  medor is not intended to provide a consensus of disorder prediction. rather, it is conceived to provide a global overview of various predictions relying on different philosophies, and to speed up the disorder prediction step by itself. in addition to the fast identification of regions of disorder, medor can also be used to infer information on secondary structure elements and on the possible occurrence of transmembrane regions and signal peptides. future developments of medor may involve generation of a consensus of disorder prediction, which is expected to further accelerate the process of deciphering the modular organization of proteins. finally, as medor outputs can be saved, commented and modified further on, this offers a dynamic support for the analysis of protein sequences that is expected to be very useful in the context of collaborative projects involving several partners. as such, medor will facilitate the definition of domain boundaries amenable to structural and functional studies within proteins targeted by structural genomics consortia, such as vizier. availability

145," the blood brain barrier in the central nervous system regulates the passage of nutrients, essential components and metabolic constituents between the blood stream and the parenchymal tissue. although local neural activity is known to promote local blood supply and is the basis of the so-called blood-oxygen level gradient/dependency, the regulation of local blood flow in the parenchyma of the cns is not well understood. contraction of pre-capillary arterioles has been suggested but so far without clear demonstration. capillaries of the cns do not have smooth musculature but contractility of pericytes associated with the capillaries of peripheral tissue such as the retina, cardiac and skeletal muscles has been observed, suggesting that contraction of these cells in the cns can be a mechanism of blood supply regulation. however, the finding that pericytes of the cns lack the α-actin protein isoform found in contractile cells, appears to exclude their participation in cns capillary contraction. angiogenesis described during brain development has also been suggested as a mechanism of blood flow increment, although without clear support in normal adulthood or non-pathological contexts. the endothelial cells, pericytes and basal lamina, together with elements of the neurovascular compartment such as neurons, astrocytes, and other glial cells, adapt themselves to maintain homeostasis that promotes tissue survival. although the endothelial cell can be considered as an element which plays an important role in blood flow regulation its participation has been little analyzed, at least partly due to the intrinsic difficulty of its individual staining in capillaries of the cns. however, in order to better understand the mechanisms that occur during local blood flow changes in the cns parenchyma, the role of capillary morphology needs to be considered as an important issue. electron microscopy has provided knowledge of the capillary wall constituents, but the small spatial range of this method is a critical and important limitation of this powerful tool, e.g. the size of a capillary endothelial cell is still not known. despite attempts to obtain markers enabling cns capillary imaging or visualization of capillary networks through extracellular tracers, fluorescent markers, diamine benzidine reaction, immunocytochemistry as well as brain arterial injection with black ink or venous plastic infusion, a complete view of the morphology of cns capillaries still is lacking. in this respect, recently we proposed an alternative histological tool focused on detecting the relative space occupied by the capillary endothelial cell. this visualization through light microscopy is based on two facts: first, the optical effect that reflecting light produces in fixed and unstained capillaries, and second, evidence provided by em showing that the internal wall of cns capillaries is exclusively constituted by the endothelial cell. using this procedure we found that changes in capillary luminal area can be detected indirectly via changes in the inner capillary diameter. with the aim of investigating the participation of the capillary endothelial cell in the regulation of blood flow fluctuations that occur in response to changes in neuronal activity, the present study was directed to quantifying the internal diameter of capillaries in the anterior hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in female rats. we chose this nucleus since several of its physiological aspects but not its microvasculature have been intensely studied. for example, it is well known that the magno- and parvocellular regions via a neuroendocrine reflex are involved in oxytocin production and release in response to mammary gland sensory stimulation, and that the effect varies according to the reproductive phase of the female rat. thus, we decided to measure and compare the capillary internal diameter during the diestrous phase of virgin rats and during the lactation period of mother rats. to ensure that the sensory information received by the two groups was significantly different, mammary glands of the mother rats were stimulated by their pups suckling for two weeks of lactation, while virgin rats had no stimulation.  general microvasculature characteristics unstained brain sections from all animals were characterized by networks of highly interconnected blood vessels with a wide range of calibers. in particular, sections from the anterior hypothalamic region showed an area of high capillary density corresponding to the pvn; clearly seen in six serial sections with an anterior-posterior length of approximately μm. this conspicuous density of capillaries could no longer be visualized after cresyl violet staining, since application of the cover slip and permount modified the optical effect that reflecting light produces on the capillaries, thus impeding their visualization. however, the stained neurons enabled us to confirm the exact pvn location as well as the location of the magno- and parvocellular regions. inner capillary diameter when for the virgin animals in diestrous phase the icd values from the magnocellular subdivision of the left pvn were compared with those of the right pvn there was no difference. similarly there was no difference when the values from the parvocellular subdivision of the left pvn were compared with those of the right pvn. also in the mother lactating animals the icd values of the left and right magnocellular subdivisions did not differ, nor in the left and right parvocellular subdivisions. therefore, the data from each cellular subdivision were combined. as shown in figure the vir group presented icds ranging from to μm in both regions, with most capillaries located in the 6-μm range, followed by the 5- and 7-μm ranges, respectively. when the percentage values of the icd magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions were compared, they did not differ significantly. in contrast, the lac group showed an icd distribution that ranged from to μm in both regions, with most capillaries located in the 7-μm range followed by the 8- and 6-μm ranges, respectively. again, when the percentage values from the two regions were compared, no difference was found. thus, as seen in figure the lac group showed a tendency towards a greater percentage of capillaries with large icd. to clarify this observation and since there were no significant differences between the measurements obtained in the two pvn subdivisions of either group, we decided to compare the data between the two experimental conditions by grouping the icd measurements into two capillary ranges: with small and large diameters. this confirmed that the lac group had a significantly higher percentage of large diameter capillaries compared to the vir group. pvn neurovascular compartment when values for the space occupied by neural and glial, but excluding vascular elements of the neurovascular compartment were compared between pvn magno- and parvocellular subdivisions from the vir and lac groups, we found no significant differences between the two groups; neural and glial elements occupied approximately 30% of the space in all the sample fields analyzed. discussion whereas the physiology and neuronal characteristics of the pvn have been widely investigated, its microvasculature has been much less so. morphological changes such as glial retraction, neuronal remodeling, c-fos expression and electrophysiological activity increment during lactation have been reported, and there is no doubt that greater synthesis and release of ot from both the pvn and supraoptic nucleus occurs. this could reflect an increment in the local neural activity of these structures that in turn promotes an increment in local blood flow. in the present study our results suggest that, at least in the pvn, local blood flow increment could be via an increment in the icd rather by an increase in outer capillary diameter or angiogenesis. our findings showing that the area occupied by the neural and glial elements of the neurovascular compartment did not change in virgin compared to lactating rats, suggest that angiogenesis is not present. in addition, it has been suggested that components of the capillary basal lamina such as laminin, cablin, fibronectin and type iv collagen among others prevent the outer ec diameter from expanding. in relation to our proposal that icd increment promotes increases in blood flow, we mention the following: local blood flow regulation in the parenchyma of the cns is not well understood. however, capillary contraction caused by swelling of ec with no change in the external diameter of the capillary has been previously suggested as an active mechanism of local capillary constriction in peripheral tissue. thus, in accordance with our findings of significant changes in the icd of pvn microvasculature in the lac group, we take up this idea again to offer an account of how fast, regional, and reversible control of blood supply in the cns might occur. changes in the icd might take place via modifications of ec cytoplasmic volume; when this decreases the capillary lumen increases, and the time needed for cytoplasmic transport of substances from the luminal to the abluminal side of the membrane decreases. it is known that the reduction or increase in either local blood supply or the bidirectional “blood ↔ parenchyma” transport of metabolic constituents depends upon the ec which, together with the basal lamina, constitute the capillary wall. accordingly, when the cytoplasmic volume increases, the capillary lumen decreases, causing cytoplasmic transport of metabolites from the luminal to the abluminal side of the membrane to be slowed. there are a wide variety of factors that modify intracellular osmolarity, thereby promoting changes in cytoplasmic ec volume. organic osmolytes, taurine, cyclosporine, water, some hormones such as vasopressin or ot, and free radicals have all been implicated in mechanisms of cell volume regulation. thus, it is possible that neurons and/or astrocytes could modulate their own capillary blood supply as well as the transport and supply of metabolically important substances via such factors. in addition, it is currently thought that transport of water-soluble molecules across ec is accomplished by the continuous formation of plasmalemma vesicles followed by detachment and fusion to the membrane on the other side of the cell or by transport of cytoplasmic vesicles moving from one surface to the other without membrane fusion. either of these mechanisms of intracellular transport could be present in the capillary ec and depending on the luminal-abluminal distance the cytoplasmic transport time could be faster or slower. this could represent a dynamic and plastic mechanism by which constantly changing neuronal needs are rapidly met. as physiological changes associated with chronic dehydration, hemorrhage, stress condition as well as pregnancy and parturition, are associated with the synthesis and release of ot or vp from the pvn and supraoptic nucleus, then, based on our results, we should not reject the idea that a similar dynamic mechanism of blood flow regulation in response to such stimuli might occur. finally, it is well-known that during lactation progesterone and prolactin reach high levels in the blood stream. since prl has been implicated in ot release, this hormone could be a potential candidate to participate in pvn blood flow regulation.  our findings suggest that during lactation the microvasculature of the pvn of female rats undergoes dynamic, transitory changes in blood supply represented by an increment in the icd through self-cytoplasmic volume modification reflected by ec changes. this is relevant to consider from the pharmacological point of view, since changes in cytoplasmic volume in the ec could help to increase blood flow and in this way facilitate the metabolic exchange between capillaries and the cns parenchyma. "," the role of the endothelial cell in blood flow regulation within the central nervous system has been little studied. here, we explored ec participation in morphological changes of the anterior hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus microvasculature of female rats at two reproductive stages with different metabolic demand. we measured the inner capillary diameter of capillaries from either the magnocellular or parvocellular regions. the space occupied by neural and glial, but excluding vascular elements of the neurovascular compartment was also measured in 100-μm sample fields of both pvn subdivisions.  the pvn of both groups of animals showed icds that ranged from to microns. the virgin group presented mostly capillaries with small icd, whereas the lactating females exhibited a significant increment in the percentage of capillaries with larger icd. the space occupied by the neural and glial elements of the neurovascular compartment did not show changes with lactation.  our findings suggest that during lactation the microvasculature of the pvn of female rats undergoes dynamic, transitory changes in blood flow as represented by an increment in the icd through a self-cytoplasmic volume modification reflected by ec changes. a model of this process is proposed. inner capillary diameterendothelial cellneurovascular compartmenthypothalamuslactation ",f7dda0fa-2419-4f59-9eab-cbd107330001,pubmed
146," nasal polyp constitutes a benign growth process in the nasal and sinus mucosa which is mainly located in the middle meatus and never in the inferior meatus. the etiology of nasal polyps, which is a common clinical condition, is not well understood. infections, allergy and immunological factors are considered. histopathologically polyps surface is covered by a ciliated pseudostratified epithelium and the subepithelial area is characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation in more than 80% of cases. the density of goblet cells in nasal polyps is much lower than in the normal nasal mucosa. the glands of nasal polyps are long, tubular, of varying shape, size and type, and their density is more than times lower than in nasal mucosa. receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on siso cells is a protein which has been demonstrated in various human cancer cells responsible for tumour escape from host immunological surveillance. rcas is not only the marker of cancer process, but its expression has also been observed in physiological conditions and the development of non-neoplastic tumours. it has been demonstrated in the bone marrow, the endometrium, the decidua, the placenta, waldeyer's ring and immune mediated diseases. rcas seems to be responsible for the regulation of cytotoxic cells activity. within waldeyer's ring rcas has been expressed by reticular epithelial cells lining the tonsils. the reticular epithelium enables the communication between the antigen and the germinal center, which activates an immunological response. this role of rcas in the regulation of immune cells activity has also been confirmed in the creation of maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy. the expression of rcas in the healthy endometrium depended on the hormonal cycle fluctuations and was related to the immune cytotoxic activity changes. dna fragmentation factor is composed of a kda protein dff with a nuclease activity, and a kda protein inhibitory subunit dff. since dff is able to interact with this nuclease as a molecular chaperone and ensures its correct folding it has been shown to be required for generating functional dff nuclease. it has been demonstrated that dff-45-deficient thymocytes are more resistant to programmed cell death. in esophageal and colon carcinoma cells characterized by an impairment of apoptosis, a decrease of dff level has also been observed. during apoptosis dff was described as a substrate for caspase- dff seems to play an important role in the onset of apoptotic process by acting probably through the regulation of dna fragmentation. the aim of the study was to evaluate the ability to regulate the cytotoxic immune response and to determine the resistance to apoptosis in nasal polyps.  eosinophilic nasal polyps constituted almost % of examined samples, the infiltration of lymphocytes was predominant in % of nasal polyps and neutrophil concentration was observed in %. rcas expression in nasal polyps rcas was identified in all examined tissue samples as a kda band. the highest rcas relative amount was identified in nasal polyps predominantly infiltrated by lymphocytes and it was statistically significantly higher than in eosinophilic nasal polyps. the lowest rcas expression level was observed in neutrophilic nasal polyps, and it was statistically significantly lower than in eosinophilic nasal polyps and statistically significantly lower than in lymphocytic nasal polyps. the rcas expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry method in all examined tissue samples. a correlation of rcas expression between western blotting and immunohistochemistry was identified. rcas immunoreactivity was found in superficial layer of pseudostratified ciliated epithelium covering the surface of nasal polyps. moreover, rcas expression was also identified in macrophages of polypoid stroma. dff expression in nasal polyps dff expression was identified in all examined tissue samples as a kda band. dff expression was statistically significantly higher in eosinophilic nasal polyps in comparison to lymphocytic nasal polyps and significantly higher in eosinophilic nasal polyps than in neutrophilic. dff expression was at a comparable level in neutrophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps. the obtained results of rcas dff- and beta-actin control protein in examined tissue samples are presented in table • no differences statically significant, the fact that the amount of beta-actin in all groups of examined nasal polyps was found to be identical indicates that the loading of protein was equal in all samples examined and allows to perform a comparative study in rcas expression between examined groups. discussion in the presented study statistically significant differences in rcas and dff expression in nasal polyps were identified according to the predominant immune cell infiltration type: eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils. the regulation of polypoid growth is biochemically determinated by various factors, like galectin- known of anti-apoptotic activity, which expression is markedly higher in nasal polyps than in nasal turbinate. apoptosis is defined as programmed cell death. it has been reported that apoptosis mediated through the interaction of fas and fas-l might participate in immune privilege of nasal polyps. fas/fas-l interactions are an important mechanism in the functional organ development and in pathological changes such as cancer and immune mediated diseases through the participation in the regulation of the activity of immune cells. the expression of fas-l has been identified in both nasal polyps and nasal turbinate mucosa, but has been enhanced in nasal polyps. moreover, fas-l positive cells have been found in the down growing epithelium of nasal polyps and in the epithelial layer of cystically dilated glands. fas/fas-l interaction results in the activation of the caspase cascade through fadd leading to the dff- dissociation from dff- and liberation of the dna-ase responsible for the dna fragmentation. ohshima compared fasl and rcas expressions in reed-sternberg cells and trophoblast cells, and revealed that both proteins activate independently fas-associated death domain which activates the caspase cascade and leads to the apoptosis of target cell. in this way the cells expressing rcas and fas-l are responsible for suppression of immune cytotoxic lymphocytes. in both, fas-l and rcas pathways of apoptosis dff-45/dff- complex seems to be crucial. in the presented study rcas immunohistochemically was identified only in the pseudostratified ciliated epithelium covering the surface of nasal polyps and this localization differs from the reported fas-l localization in nasal polyps. rcas positive macrophages were identified in polypoid tissue stroma. until now rcas positive macrophages have been identified in the bone marrow where they are responsible for the regulation of maturating erythroblasts. additionally rcas positive macrophages have been found in ovarian endometriosis although they have not been present in the normal, eutopic endometrium. in sum, it might be interpreted that rcas positive macrophages might participate in the local immune dysfunction in nasal polyps. the inflammatory infiltrate of nasal polyps consists of eosinophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophage-like cd68+ cells. both eosinophils and lymphocytes are resistant to fas-l/fas mediated apoptosis. the lymphocytes that infiltrate nasal polyps have been defined to be predominantly memory t cells in an activated status and produced a mixed th1/th cytokine pattern. cytokines, including il- ifn-gamma, gm-csf also participate in delaying of the death process in these cells, thus contributing to developing of tissue and blood eosinophilia. the lymphocytes infiltrated nasal polyps in our study were characterized by the highest rcas expression level and a statistically significantly lower dff- expression than eosinophilic nasal polyps. low dff- level might indicate that the polyps infiltrated by lymphocytes are more resistant to immune mediated apoptosis than eosinophilic nasal polyps. additionally, the expression of rcas a factor participating in the suppression of cytotoxic activity, might help polypoid tissue to avoid immune cytotoxicity. the etiology of neutrophilic nasal polyps is connected with bacterial inflammation. it has been postulated that superantigens derived mainly from staphylococcus aureus might be potent activators of t cells and might therefore participate in the formation of nasal polyps. superantigens are able to activate the immune cytotoxic response without antigen presenting cells which results in the exposure of polypoid tissue to immune mediated apoptosis. in our study neutrophilic nasal polyps were characterized by a comparable level of dff- as lymphocytic nasal polyps and lower than eosinophilic nasal polyps. we suspect that neutrophilic nasal polyps, similarly to lymphocytic nasal polyps, are more resistant to immune mediated apoptosis than eosinophilic nasal polyps, which might compensate the immune cytotoxicity. the observed decreased rcas expression in neutrophilic nasal polyps might result from the immune cells infiltration pattern.  the changes in dff- level in nasal polyps regarding the type of immune cell infiltration might indicate a different resistance to apoptosis mediated by immune cells. the alterations in rcas expression indicate that nasal polyps have the ability to regulate the cytotoxic immune response. "," nasal polyp constitutes a benign growth process in the nasal and sinus mucosa. rcas is a protein expressed mainly by various human cancer cells. it is not only the marker of cancer process and its expression can also be observed in physiological processes. it is responsible for the regulation of immune cells activity. dff has been described as a substrate for caspase- dff seems to play an important role in the onset of apoptotic process by acting probably through the regulation of dna fragmentation. the aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of nasal polyps to regulate the cytotoxic immune response and to determine their resistance to apoptosis.  the higher rcas level was identified in lymphocytic nasal polyps, the medium one in eosinophilic while the lowest was identified in neutrophilic. dff- expression was higher in eosinophilic than in neutrophilic and lymphocytic nasal polyps.  the changes in dff- level in nasal polyps might indicate a different resistance to apoptosis mediated by immune cells. the alterations in rcas expression indicate that nasal polyps have the ability to regulate the cytotoxic immune response. the breaking of resistance to immune mediated apoptosis in nasal polyps might have a new therapeutic impact.

147," next-generation sequencing is a powerful genomic tool that can be used to investigate the transcriptome, the translatome and the interactome. however, substantial differences in data obtained have been observed when the same fragment library is sequenced on different platforms. this has motivated attempts to characterise and remedy biases in sequencing library generation, either through modification of protocols or applying bioinformatic corrections. whilst there are a number of different sequencing platforms, each share a common series of steps to convert the rna pool of interest into an rna-seq library. each platform has a specific set of adaptors that are ligated to both 5′ and 3′ ends of a pool of rna fragments of interest. these adaptors are then used to prime reverse transcription and pcr amplification. these completed libraries are then sequenced, using the adaptors as the starting point for the sequencing reaction. however, the biochemical manipulations involved in this library generation process introduce biases that affect the final sequencing output. pcr amplification results in under-representation of both at rich and gc rich regions, but this can be minimised by the use of polymerases that have been generated through molecular evolution to reduce these biases such as kapa hifi. single molecule studies have shown that t rna ligases and, which are used to ligate adaptor sequences, are also associated with significant biases. a point mutation of the truncated rnl reduces bias, but fragments predicted to co-fold with the adaptor are still over-represented in sequencing libraries when standard protocols are used. to address whether ligation at temperatures that minimise co-folding reduces bias, a thermostable 3′rna ligase has been developed: methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum rna ligase k97a mutant. to date, the suitability of mth k97a for use in rna-seq has not been assessed. alongside developments in enzyme technology, new ligation strategies have been developed. for example, the circlig protocol avoids the use of rnl in this approach an adaptor is ligated to the 3′ end of fragments with trrnl k227q and used to prime reverse transcription with a primer containing two pcr primer sites. the resulting cdna is circularised resulting in pcr primer sites either side of the fragment permitting amplification. library generation for life technologies’ sequencing platforms employs hybridisation to duplex adaptors with degenerate overhangs prior to ligation with trrnl.figure schematic of rna-seq library generation protocols. rna fragments are ligated to adaptors that permit reverse transcription and pcr amplification prior to sequencing. the circlig protocol involves ligation to a ssdna adaptor prior to reverse transcription with a primer that results in pcr primer sites either side of the fragment when the cdna is circularised. the life technologies protocol involves hybridisation to duplexed rna-dna adaptors containing degenerate ssdna overhangs prior to ligation. herein we present the first direct comparison of the circlig and standard life technologies protocols. furthermore, to investigate whether mth k97a might be suitable for use in rna-seq library generation, we substituted it for trrnl k227q in the circlig protocol. the degree of bias was assessed by generating libraries from a pool of 20 nt rnas of known composition using each protocol and sequencing them on an ion torrent personal genome machine.  comparing over-representation introduced by different library preparation protocols an rna fragment pool composed of 10 nt chosen at random followed by 10 nt of degenerate sequence was converted into a cdna sequencing library using either the standard ion torrent protocol, circlig protocol with trrnl k277q or circlig protocol with mth k97a. despite both universal adaptor and enzyme being in greater than 3-fold molar excess of the fragment pool, mth k97a did not successfully ligate all fragments. in addition, there was no improvement of ligation efficiency with increased incubation time. ligated fragments were recovered and converted to cdna libraries as described in the methods. to reduce any potential confounding effect of pcr biases, all libraries were amplified under the same conditions prior to sequencing on an ion torrent pgm. sequenced reads of the expected size were selected and trimmed to remove adaptor sequences and the first 10 nt of the fragment. subsequent analysis was performed on the remaining 10 nt sequences.figure ligation of rna pool to universal adaptor in circlig protocol. schematic of the ligation reaction. 40 ng rna pool was ligated in the presence of excess universal adaptor with either trrnl k227q or mth k97a as described in the methods. rna was precipitated and separated on a 15% acrylamide gel. universal adaptor fragment pool ligated fragments. degeneracy at positions yields, unique sequences at equimolar concentrations, giving a theoretical read distribution of x ~ binomial where x is the number of times a particular sequence is observed in n sequenced reads. all library protocols resulted in read distributions that were over-dispersed relative to the theoretical. goodness of fit comparisons between each distribution and the theoretical yielded the minimum computable p-value in the r software environment. the most abundant sequences were present at least times more than would be expected in the absence of bias. however, the most abundant sequences from the trrnl k227q circlig library were approximately half as over-dispersed as those from the standard library and reached statistical significance. somewhat surprisingly, replacing trrnl k227q with mth k97a did not further reduce over-representation.figure over-representation in sequencing libraries. sequencing libraries were generated from the partially degenerate rna pool using either the standard protocol, the circlig protocol with trrnl k227q or the circlig protocol with mth k97a. the abundance of each unique sequence within the degenerate region was calculated as a ratio of the total read data. the density of the most abundant sequences are presented for each library. the theoretical is x ~ binominal. position specific biases to identify position specific biases associated with each protocol, the nucleotide content at each position within the degenerate region was calculated. use of mth k97a was associated with a strong preference for adenine and cytosine at the 3rd nucleotide from the ligation site. the other protocols did not result in position specific bias, however all libraries had a higher than expected guanidine content. elevated g-content was only observed in the most abundant reads, suggesting this bias cannot be explained by incorrect formulation of the fragment pool.figure position specific bias associated with mth k97a. the abundance of each nucleotide at each position within the degenerate portion of the sequenced reads was calculated. the use of mth k97a in library construction was associated with pronounced over-representation of a and c at the 3rd nucleotide from the ligation site. sequences were ranked based on abundance and the nucleotide content calculated across a sliding window of sequences. correlation between predicted structure and over-representation to assess the association between the secondary structure of the rna fragments and co-folding with adaptor sequences, in silico folding experiments were performed under the conditions used for each library protocol. over-representation of fragments was correlated with degree of predicted secondary structure in all libraries. duplex adaptors could not be modelled preventing assessment of co-folding in the standard protocol, but for the circlig protocols, over-represented fragments were more likely to co-fold with the adaptor.figure over-represented sequences are more likely to be structured. the predicted folding energy for each unique sequence under the ligation reaction conditions was calculated. sequences were ranked based on abundance and the mean folding energy calculated across a sliding window of sequences. over-represented sequences are more likely to be predicted to co-fold with the adaptor. the predicted folding energy between the adaptor sequence and each unique rna fragment sequence was computed. sequences were ranked based on abundance and the mean folding energy calculated across a sliding window of sequences. importantly, only the most over-represented fragments from the mth library were associated with any secondary structure or co-folding ability suggesting that secondary structure is not a major source of bias when this protocol and enzyme are used. discussion next-generation sequencing can be used for a range of genomic investigations. however, as with any technology, systemic biases affect the accuracy of sequencing data and thus the strength of conclusions that can be drawn. the ligation step in library generation has been shown to be a significant source of bias. we found that compared to the standard protocol the circlig protocol with trrnl k227q was associated with almost half the level of over-representation when a degenerate rna pool was sequenced. although the adaptor sequences for library generation differ between life technologies solid and ion torrent platforms, the protocols are essentially similar. therefore, using the correct adaptor sequences, the circlig approach could be used for any life technologies platform and be expected to produce more representative libraries than the standard protocols. analysis of the sequencing data from both standard and circlig protocols revealed the sequences that were over-represented were predicted to be more structured under the ligation conditions. this correlation may be causative as t rna ligase is involved in the repair of nicked dsrna, but this paper does not seek to address this question directly. instead we show that ligation with the thermostable ligase mth k97a at temperatures not broadly permissive for secondary structure and co-folding does not reduce over-representation. a substantial portion of the rna pool could not be ligated using mth k97a. the initial characterisation of the ligation efficiency of this enzyme was performed with one rna sequence. by using a partially degenerate fragment pool we are able to characterise the enzyme more fully and reveal the enzyme has a strong preference for a and c at the 3rd nucleotide from the ligation site. consistent with this, much higher ligation efficiencies were obtained when the enzyme was used by zhelkovsky and reynolds to ligate rna with a at this position than we observed with our partially degenerate rna pool. while we cannot exclude the possibility that this is specific to the adaptor sequence used, this bias does make mth k97a inappropriate for use in existing sequencing protocols. surprisingly, the most abundant sequences in all libraries had a higher than expected g-content. it is unclear whether this is because each library protocol has a previously unknown bias in favour of g-rich sequences or if the bias is at a step common to all libraries. we suggest this may be an interesting avenue for further research.  the circlig protocol reduces, but does not abolish, bias associated with ion torrent pgm rna-seq. highly structured sequences are more likely to be over-represented in rna-seq libraries, but this is not remedied by the use of the thermostable mth k97a enzyme. although the circlig protocol does involve more hands-on time than the standard life technologies protocol, it offers superior accuracy and therefore we recommend it for sequencing on life technologies platforms. "," next-generation sequencing does not yield fully unbiased estimates for read abundance, which may impact on the conclusions that can be drawn from sequencing data. the ligation step in rna sequencing library generation is a known source of bias, motivating developments in enzyme technology and library construction protocols. we present the first comparison of the standard duplex adaptor protocol supplied by life technologies for use on the ion torrent pgm with an alternate single adaptor approach involving circligase. a correlation between over-representation in sequenced libraries and degree of secondary structure has been reported previously, therefore we also investigated whether bias could be reduced by ligation with an enzyme that functions at a temperature not permissive for such structure.  a pool of small rna fragments of known composition was converted into a sequencing library using one of three protocols and sequenced on an ion torrent pgm. the circlig protocol resulted in less over-representation of specific sequences than the standard protocol. over-represented sequences are more likely to be predicted to have secondary structure and to co-fold with adaptor sequences. however, use of the thermostable ligase methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum rna ligase k97a was not sufficient to reduce bias.  the single adaptor circligase-based approach significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, bias in ion torrent data. ligases that function at temperatures to remove the possible influence of secondary structure on library generation may be of value, although mth k97a is not effective in this case. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords next-generation sequencingbiasion torrentmth k97athermostablecircligasesmall rnaissue-copyright-statement© the author 2014 ",5b87d18d-3940-4416-ba02-ce9cb77bfb1f,pubmed
148," bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacillus that causes anthrax. this bacterium is commonly found in soil and is responsible for diseases of herbivores and other mammals including humans. anthrax is still endemic in many countries, middle east, africa, north, central and south america, as well as other areas of the world. the site of entry determines different forms of anthrax, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation; the latter form is highly fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 80% in the absence of an adequate antimicrobial therapy. yersinia pestis is a gram-negative bacterium, etiological agent of plague. the bacterium is transmitted by fleas or aerosols, causing different forms of plague: bubonic, septicemic or pneumonic. y.pestis is often associated with the wellknown black death plague of the middle ages, a pandemic that had killed a third of european population in the 14th and 15th centuries, but approximately human cases still occur worldwide each year. primary pneumonic plague is rapidly progressive and virulent, and, as inhalation anthrax, with a mortality rate close to 100% in the absence of a timely treatment. y. pestis and b. anthracis are both considered serious threats and potential bioterrorism agents because of their evaluation as bioweapons by soviet union and united states laboratories during the past decades. above all, b. anthracis gained renewed attention in when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed causing the death of five persons and infecting others, while probably hundreds of people were exposed to infectious spores. both agents are classified by the us centre for disease control and prevention in the bioterrorism disease agent list as category a microrganism, the most dangerous ones, because of easy dissemination and transmission, high mortality and impact to public health. b. anthracis and y. pestis both show very low intraspecies genetic diversity, making very challenging the rapid and accurate differentiation among individual biovars and strains. nevertheless, finding a way to differenziate the strains by molecular genotyping, remains essential for discrimination between naturally occurring versus intentional outbreaks. the importance of forensic microbiology, as this field is know called, was demonstrated during the events, and previously by tokyo and sverdlovsk incidents. finally genetic characterization of isolates allows to increase information about worldwide bacterial distribution and epidemiology. standard genotyping methods require either highly discriminative but heavy, and relatively expensive devices such as automated capillary electrophoresis devices, or cheaper, easy to use but more time consuming and with lower resolution power such as agarose gels. a new miniaturized platform for quantification and separation of nucleic acid molecules, agilent bioanalyzer, has shown accuracy, precision and high feasibility along with speed and moderate cost reagents. this platform is based on microfluidic technology and allows to analyze dna samples in minutes. the device, also called ""lab on a chip"", integrates multiple functions onto a single apparatus, so that sample dispensing, separation, detection and analysis are performed on the same support. along with limited weight and size, the above features make the instrument ideal for field use and other on-site investigations. agilent can also be easily used by low-expertise staff. a similar system was previously employed to study the genetic variability of bcla gene for strain discrimination within the bacillus cereus group. in this paper we evaluate this approach for genotyping analysis of the two major biothreat agents.  experimental design in order to validate this platform, we compared the data produced by the agilent bioanalyzer to agarose gel based data and capillary gel based data. ten y. pestis and thirty-nine b. anthracis strains were genotyped using previously described sets of vntr loci. these previously genotyped strains were chosen to be representative of allelic variability within the two species. briefly, these genotypes are from strains with the largest genetic distance, encompassing most of the observed allele variation. the vntr markers amplified for bacterial genotyping, were arranged into pcr multiplex reactions either for b. anthracis or y. pestis. this allowed us to use a single dna chip for each strain. after pcr amplification μl of each reaction was loaded into 12-wells chip. primer concentrations were experimentally adjusted to obtain a balanced amplification of different fragments. this optimization was facilitated using the quantification data supplied by the bioanalyzer. the vast majority of data produced by agilent were not accurate. the discrepancies between observed and expected fragment size are, presumably, the result of abnormal migration patterns of some repetitive sequences into electrophoretic matrix. in order to check if the offset was reproducible, we tested interchip and intrachip variability in markers containing the smallest repeat units, for which incorrect allelic calling is more probable. the samples were run in triplicate on the same and on different chips, and size data compared. in general, it was observed a low level of inter-intrachip variability. for example, for b. anthracis cg marker, we observed ± for allele and ± for allele to correctly convert the agilent dna fragment size estimates into repeat copy numbers, it was necessary to establish conversion tables containing bioanalyzer fragment sizes as well as actual sizes corresponding to repeats unit numbers, as previously reported. * modified primer set once these reproducible offset values are taken into account, the mlva assay as run on the agilent exhibited concordant results with previous typing results for b. anthracis and y. pestis. we were able to resolve closely sized dna fragments, and the analyzed samples showed concordance either with interchip repetitions or with expected size data. these data, used for upgma cluster analysis, generate dendrograms with linkage distance perfectly identical to those previously obtained by standard methodologies. for each individual strain the agilent assay is completed in about minutes after pcr amplification. for a single strain to be genotyped, this time is significantly lower than hours described in previous assay. genotyping b. anthracis with the 25-loci mlva to fit all the loci into a 12-wells chip the b. anthracis loci were combined into triplex, duplex and singleplex pcr amplifications. the arrangement of different loci in the same multiplex is such as to avoid overlapping of vntr markers size ranges. for four b. anthracis loci multiplexing was impossible, because of the large allele size range. primer sequences were as described in, loci combination and final primers concentrations are reported in table under these conditions, we were able to amplify each expected fragment, and the software could identify amplicon size. the offset values for all loci and alleles were measured and are presented in tables and for chromosomal markers, reproducibility of the observed data allowed correct assignment of each allele for every locus. however, for plasmid markers, since their shorter repeat unit and pcr product size compared to the chromosomal ones, we observed variability not exceeding one single additional base for each allele in repeated runs. even with this additional base, correct assignment could be reproducibly done for the plasmid loci. genotyping y. pestis with the 25-loci mlva to fit all the loci into chip wells the y. pestis markers were grouped into duplex and one triplex. the majority of primer sequences were as described in but for y. pestis markers new primer pairs were redesigned to allow multiplexing. thus, final amplicon size was increased to avoid any possible overlap with other different loci into the new multiplexed reactions. for y. pestis markers, we observed variability up to two bases and, as previously described for b. anthracis, discrepancies not exceeding 25% of the repeat unit size. discussion the intentional release of anthrax spores by mail in in the united states caused the death of five persons by inhalation anthrax and publicly demonstrated the bioweapon-associated threat, of which only the community of biodefence experts was previously aware. this increased the demands for a better genetic characterization of bioterrorism agents, in order to distinguish between natural outbreaks and/or intentional release of micro-organisms, and to help trace back the origin of an aggression. we have here evaluated the agilent ""lab on a chip"" platform for genotyping of b. anthracis and y. pestis strains on. this assay runs in minutes one multiplexed pcr reactions chip, genotyping a single isolate at a time. for this reason this system is faster compared to automated sequencing devices, either slab gel or capillary based when a single strain has to be genotyped. given the possibility to compare different chip runs in different times this device can immediately show identities or diversities between new isolates compared to already characterized ones. moreover it has shown a high degree of automation either for amplicon separation or for digital output of results. compared to previous genotyping methods, the bionalyzer is more effective than standard ethidium bromide slab gel electrophoresis, giving reproducible, precise and more sensible output for the shortest repeat units. since no fluorescent primers are required the assay is cheaper to maintain than ceq or other sequencing machines. a rough estimation of the total cost of a loci assay indicates that genotyping on this equipment is at least four to ten times less expensive than a capillary system assay, at low to medium throughput level. the equipment itself is cheaper, and both consumables and equipment can be stored for a long period of time and activated when needed. finally, the results are comparable to those obtained by automated sequencers. this platform appears particularly useful when response time is the critical factor. we propose therefore such a system as a method suitable for high resolution identification of biothreat agents. to date this system is the most effective genotyping technology available for on-site investigations. also, this platform may be used for fast quality-checking of type collection, and dna preparations for biosecurity and strain accountability purposes. typing data produced by the mlva approach can be easily compared using shared internet databases, as illustrated for instance in.  in this paper we describe a fieldable genotyping method for b. anthracis and y. pestis. this method is an adaptation on agilent bioanalyzer of previously described loci mlva. the system was validated by characterizing thirty-nine b. anthracis and ten y. pestis isolates, demonstrating to be, for a single genotyping, more rapid than traditional methods. the transfer on a new platform maintains reproducibility and precision to unambigously identify alleles. this method is shown to be a valid alternative to standard genotyping techniques for field characterization of important biothreat agents. "," anthrax and plague are diseases caused by bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis respectively. these bacteria are etiological agents for worldwide zoonotic diseases and are considered among the most feared potential bioterror agents. strain differentiation is difficult for these microorganisms because of their high intraspecies genome homogeneity. moreover, fast strain identification and comparison with known genotypes may be crucial for naturally occurring outbreaks versus bioterrorist events discrimination.  thirty-nine b. anthracis and ten y. pestis strains, representative of the species genetic diversity, were genotyped by agilent bioanalyzer using previously described multiple locus vntr analysis assays. results were compared to previous data obtained by standard genotyping system and, when necessary, direct amplicon sequencing. a reference comparison table containing actual fragment sizes, sequencer sizes and agilent sizes was produced.  in this report an automated dna electrophoresis apparatus which provides a cheaper alternative compared to capillary electrophoresis approaches was applied for genotyping of b. anthracis and y. pestis. this equipment, uses pre-cast gels and provides easy transportation, low maintenance and overall general logistic requirements and costs, is easy to set up and provides rapid analysis. this platform is a candidate for on-site mlva genotyping of biothreat agents as well as other bacterial pathogens. it is an alternative to the more expensive and demanding capillary electrophoresis methods, and to the less expensive but more time-consuming classical gel electrophoresis approach.

149," lepeophtheirus salmonis is a major ectoparasite pathogen of farmed atlantic salmon in the northern hemisphere. sea lice infestations have a detrimental effect on health, production and market value of fish. the ecological impact on intensive salmon aquaculture has been of concern since published reports first suggested a link between the decline of wild salmon stocks and the presence of sea lice on salmon farms. the norwegian food and safety authority have implemented precautionary measures to reduce the impact of sea lice from salmon production sites. these measures mandate the delousing or harvesting of production sites once sea lice infestations surpass the threshold set by nsfa. while novel intervention strategies are being explored, the successful control of sea lice infestations in production sites is currently heavily dependent on effective delousing using chemotherapeutants. management systems for production of salmon in norway have rapidly grown in the last decade, largely through intensification of fish production through the use of large pens and automation of feeding. such operations however may magnify certain problems associated with the application of bath treatments. for example, the effectiveness of topical bath administrations is dependent on accurate dosage and a rapid and uniform distribution of the chemotherapeutant in the water column. inadequate medicinal exposure will result in incomplete treatment. the unintended effects of inadequate treatments include the repeated usage of chemotherapeutants over the production cycle and a risk that chemical resistance will emerge in sea lice populations. evaluation of field treatment effectiveness should identify those treatments that do not achieve the expected effect. whilst reported treatment failures have been identified in norway using alternative methods such as bioassays and probit modelling, current methods monitor the average reduction in mobiles following treatment. this simplified analysis risks overlooking changes that may cause treatment failure such as reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutants. multivariate analyses enable the concurrent evaluation of effectiveness of treatment against all sea lice life cycle stages. delousing effectiveness is multifactorial, being dependent on the interaction between biotic factors, such as life cycle stage, gender and phase in the molting cycle, as well as abiotic factors such as water temperatures and salinity. consequently, a more robust interpretation of treatment effect can be made by incorporating data from sea lice life cycle stages. this type of approach is used in ecological studies to evaluate the effect or alterations that environmental stressors or toxicants produce in the composition of species community. our aim was to develop improved methods for the evaluation of treatment effectiveness in the field. evaluation of treatment effectiveness against stages of salmon lice using multivariate methods provides a complete assessment of the overall effect of the drug and allows detailed comparisons between treatments. specifically, it reveals those life cycle stages of l. salmonis that after treatment were characteristic of particular sites and hence which had potential use as indicators of treatment failure. multivariate analysis also reveals other aspects that can be of interest when evaluating drug effects such as the changes in composition of l. salmonis stage groups following treatment.  presence and abundance of sea lice by stage group treatment with cypermethrin resulted in reducing mean abundance of pre-adult and adult male stages as well as adult female stages of l. salmonis at all five sites which, according to univariate analysis indicates an effectiveness in excess of 90% for all sites. l. salmonis at five sites located in western norway according to the methods described in the text the variation in mean abundance of the three stages between sites, shown in figure  found the effect of treatment against paam and adult females was similar and consistent between sites but that the reduction in chalimus stages was modest with an average reduction in abundance of 49%. this value varied between sites, with one site indicating an increase in chalimus abundance following treatment. the reduction in chalimus was only significant at site e, with sites b and c having less than 50% reduction. tukey’s hsd test found that chalimus were significantly higher post-treatment at sites b and d compared to a and e, and that site b was significantly higher than site c. post-treatment pairwise site comparisons for paam and adult female stages indicated no significant differences. changes in the composition of sea lice stages with treatment the changes in stage group composition from pre- to post- treatment were analysed using multivariate analyses. the effectiveness was assessed through the use of an ordination plot which provides a diagrammatic representation of the composition of stage groups at each site. the overlap of both pens and sites is shown in the clustering of pens before treatment, whereas the dispersion of results across pens after treatment, indicated increased heterogeneity among pens and among sites. the within-site heterogeneity of stage groups both before and after treatment with cypermethrin is summarized in table  values close to zero and one are indicative of low and high dispersion, respectively. differences between sites both pre- and post- treatment, shown in figure  were analysed by non-parametric permutational multivariate analyses to determine the extent to which production sites had similar composition of sea lice stages. three procedures indicated statistically significant differences between sites in the composition of sea lice before and after treatment. l. salmonis stage groups at five sites the anosim, adonis and mrpp analysis calculated the statistic r, the r value and chance corrected within-group agreement, respectively, which indicated the magnitude of differences between group means. *analysis of similarities anosim. †non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance with the adonis function. ‡a non-parametric procedure that does not assume normality for the distribution of data or homogeneous variances. results of the test statistics for mrpp, anosim and adonis indicated that differences between sites became larger post-treatment than before treatment. to identify which stage groups were responsible for the observed changes in composition between sites, we quantified the various life cycle stages before and after treatment. prior to treatment, chalimus and adult females accounted for the differences in composition between sites; whereas after treatment the chalimus and paam stages were responsible. following treatment, relative frequency and abundance of paam were higher at sites d and e; while for chalimus these were higher at sites b and d compared to all other sites. counts of adult females were consistently low after treatment and had no significant indicator species value. l. salmonis stage groups at five sites before and after treatment rf = relative frequency, ra = relative abundance, indval = individual species values. maximum site indicates the site that had the highest indicator value for each stage group. the p-value gives the probability of finding a higher indicator value in random permutations, with values of less than indicating that the stage group is a significant factor. at one site cypermethrin treatment was less effective against all stage groups. analysis at pen level for site d showed that treatment against paam and adult females was effective for all pens except for one where the percentage reduction for paam was 63% and for adult females was 82%. discussion synthetic pyrethroids are widely used against sea lice in norwegian aquaculture. three synthetic pyrethroids are available for lice treatments, cypermethrin deltamethrin and high-cis cypermethrin. these compounds have similar characteristics, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic efficacies. synthetic pyrethroids are insecticides that act by preventing closure of voltage-gated sodium channels resulting in abnormal hyper excitability, spastic paralysis and death. synthetic pyrethroids are highly efficacious against paam and adult females but reportedly less efficacious against chalimus stages. current analytical methods for evaluating treatment effectiveness calculate the percentage reduction in the mobile stages only. this method has low sensitivity when sampling is limited and is unlikely to fully reflect the treatment outcome since calculation of treatment effectiveness is based on average abundance for only one stage group. it is recognised that univariate analyses fail to control for experimental error and do not take account of the covariance structure in the data. we performed multivariate analyses to combine the information from all group stages and determine the stage groups that best indicate treatment effectiveness. this assessment of the community structure differs from the more statistical approaches to clustering adopted in previously published research. in this study, we examined the effectiveness of cypermethrin treatments conducted in pens at five different sites. treatment with cypermethrin resulted in a larger than 90% reduction of all mobiles, which would conventionally be taken as an indication that treatment was effective at all sites. however, high treatment effectiveness against chalimus was observed only at one site, which suggests that chalimus was the only stage group that contributed to the significant differences in abundance observed between sites after treatment. absolute numbers of chalimus were low which makes it difficult to evaluate treatment effectiveness. in addition these smaller stages are more difficult to enumerate accurately when sampling live fish in a production environment. we had expected effective treatment to homogenize the initially heterogeneous sea lice populations, yet multivariate analysis and ordination analysis revealed that there existed a latent representation of sea lice stage composition that indicated increased heterogeneity following treatment. in particular chalimus and to a lesser extent paam were identified as stage groups accounting for the phenomenon observed. several site factors could offer explanations as to how differences in estimated treatment effectiveness arise. one factor may be water temperature. low water temperatures can significantly delay the development of chalimus stages. this is suggested by the limited reduction of chalimus in low temperatures at sites b and c, despite the significant reduction in paam. it has been shown that time to chalimus mortality following application of cypermethrin is increased with low temperatures. the reduction in chalimus observed at site c was 37% 10 days after treatment; however, 20 days after treatment this reduction had increased to 90%, consistent with a delayed molting due to low temperature. a further contributory factor may be the effect of cypermethrin on the development of the chalimus since cypermethrin delays metamorphosis within the chalimus stages. the combination of temperature and developmental delay in chalimus will differentially affect the stage group composition and argues for the analysis of all stage groups when determining treatment effectiveness for this type of topical intervention. since univariate analysis utilizes only changes in paam or mobile populations the assessment of treatment effectiveness will be incomplete and potentially misleading. the time interval between treatment and sampling was not identical across sites. the size of treatment effect will be influenced by the time interval between treatment and sampling. it may therefore be advisable to standardize the time at which treatment effectiveness is observed. using univariate methods, cypermethrin treatment was highly effective against paam stages, as defined by a reduction in the lice numbers equal or larger than 90%. multivariate analyses questions this apparently satisfactory outcome. effectiveness following treatment may not be as simple as a numerical reduction in a particular lice stage but may for example be a change in the distribution of population numbers across several lice cycle stages following treatment, an alteration of the sex ratio of the adults or an unforeseen delay in stage development. multivariate methods yield data that may help more accurately define treatment effectiveness and we recommend the adoption of such methods in order to study empirical data from ‘best practice’ treatment studies. overall, cypermethrin treatment was effective at all production sites but differences were found in the composition of sea lice stages between sites after treatment. as treatment effectively reduced the paam and adult females this suggests that abiotic factors may account for differences in sea lice composition after treatment between sites. this aspect cannot be addressed from our data due to a limited sample size of five farms. identification of these factors merits further investigation.  the efficacy of outcome from topical treatment with synthetic pyrethroid is multifactorial, and not solely dependent on achieving adequate levels in the water column. with the emergence of chemical resistance there is a pressing need for comprehensive interpretation of collected data such as that offered by the multivariate approach. we have used multivariate methods to evaluate the effectiveness of cypermethrin treatment against sea lice. multivariate methods, unlike the currently adopted univariate methods which focus on a single stage group of l. salmonis, provide an improved measure of the treatment effectiveness against all parasitic stage groups. multivariate analyses could be extended to evaluate treatment against other ectoparasites of veterinary and medical importance. "," the sea louse lepeophtheirus salmonis is the most important ectoparasite of farmed atlantic salmon in norwegian aquaculture. control of sea lice is primarily dependent on the use of delousing chemotherapeutants, which are both expensive and toxic to other wildlife. the method most commonly used for monitoring treatment effectiveness relies on measuring the percentage reduction in the mobile stages of lepeophtheirus salmonis only. however, this does not account for changes in the other sea lice stages and may result in misleading or incomplete interpretation regarding the effectiveness of treatment. with the aim of improving the evaluation of delousing treatments, we explored multivariate analyses of bath treatments using the topical pyrethroid, cypermethrin, in salmon pens at five norwegian production sites.  conventional univariate analysis indicated reductions of over 90% in mobile stages at all sites. in contrast, multivariate analyses indicated differing treatment effectiveness between sites based on changes in the proportion and abundance of the chalimus and paam stages. low water temperatures and shortened intervals between sampling after treatment may account for the differences in the composition of chalimus and paam stage groups following treatment. using multivariate analysis, such factors could be separated from those which were attributable to inadequate treatment or chemotherapeutant failure.  multivariate analyses for evaluation of treatment effectiveness against multiple life cycle stages of l. salmonis yield additional information beyond that derivable from univariate methods. this can aid in the identification of causes of apparent treatment failure in salmon aquaculture. lepeophtheirus salmonisatlantic salmontreatment effectivenessmultivariate analysis ",9a10946d-98e9-4f6f-97c5-4290d7ae869e,pubmed
150," one of the critical considerations in cereal breeding is the selection of reduced height genes. this is because different rht genes do not only affect height differently but may also have different effects on other morphological and agronomic traits of importance. it is known that different rht genes can confer dwarfism by different mechanisms. two of the most widely used rht genes in wheat, rht-b1b and rht-d1b, are known to encode della proteins which repress ga responsive growth. they are thought to confer dwarfism by producing constitutively active forms of these growth repressors. rht however, is not due to defective ga biosynthesis, but to a reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids. in addition to their roles in plant development, della proteins are believed to differentially affect responses to infections by biotrophic or necrophic pathogens through their influence on the salicylic acid - jasmonic acid balance in arabidopsis. similar claims were also made recently for wheat and barley by investigating della-producing rht genes in these species. the possibility that della genes may play a critical role in disease resistance could drastically impact the efforts of cereal breeding as it could further restrict the options breeders have in exploiting the limited numbers of useful rht genes in each of these crop species. many previous studies show that rht genes, which may or may not produce della proteins, co-locate with qtl conferring fusarium head blight and fusarium crown rot resistance. considering that accurate assessments for both fcr and fhb are difficult and that resistances to these diseases can be affected by many characteristics including plant height and growth rate which often segregate in populations used for qtl mapping, it is not difficult to understand why not all plant height qtl are coincident with those for fhb or fcr susceptibility. as opposed to segregating populations where individuals have different genetic backgrounds as well as the disease resistance loci under investigation, differences between the two isolines for a given pair of nils are often minimal apart from the targeted trait. thus, assessing genetic effects of a particular gene/trait using nils can, to a large degree, eliminate the interference of other genes. as a result, nils are extensively used for analysing effects of a wide array of traits including possible effects of plant height on fhb and fcr. these studies have shown that all rht genes, including those non-ga-responsive ones, affect fhb and fcr resistance in wheat. these results seem to suggest that the effects of plant height on these fusarium diseases are unlikely related to della genes. to further clarify if the effects of plant height on fusarium resistance are related to della genes, we generated several pairs of nils for the non-ga-responsive semi-dwarfing gene uzu in barley. responses of these nils to fcr infection are described in this paper.  development and assessment of near isogenic lines for the semi-dwarfing gene uzu with the use of the ssr marker hmv ten heterozygous plants were identified from the tx9425/franklin population and five from the tx9425/gairdner population. similar to those individuals with homozygous franklin or gairdner alleles, all of the heterozygous individuals were characterized as tall plants. however, each of these individuals produced both tall and dwarf progenies. the two isolines for each of the pairs of nils developed from these heterozygous individuals showed highly significant difference in height under both temperature regimes assessed. in the low temperature regime, the average plant height across the dwarf isolines was  cm and the tall isolines was  cm thus the uzu gene reduced height by % on average. in the high temperature regime, the average plant height for the dwarf isolines was  cm and the tall isolines was  cm thus the uzu reduced height by % on average. when compared with its effects in the low temperature regime, the average impact of the uzu gene on plant height increased in the high temperature regime by % on average. uzu under two different temperature regimes# #: ‘**’indicate significant level at p < . comparisons of genomic dna sequences among the three parental genotypes used in the development of the nils confirmed the existence of the uzu allele in tx the characteristic single-nucleotide a > g substitution of uzu at the position was the only difference detected along the whole uzu gene sequence among the three genotypes. analysis of the pairs of nils using the dcap markers detected the expected uzu allele from each of the dwarf isolines. differences in fusarium crown rot severity among the nils difference in disease index between the two isolines was highly significant for each of the pairs of nils under both of the temperature regimes assessed. similar to its impacts on plant height, the semi-dwarfing gene uzu also showed larger effects on fcr severity in the high temperature regime than in the low temperature regime. in the low temperature regime, the average di value across the dwarfing isolines was and that for the tall isolines was, thus the uzu gene reduced di by % on average. in the high temperature regime, the average di was across the dwarfing isolines and was across the tall isolines thus the uzu gene reduced di by % on average. uzu under two different temperature regimes# #:‘**’indicate significant level at p < . a trend similar to that based on di values was observed when fcr severity was assessed by estimated biomasses of the fusarium pathogen. the difference between the two isolines was highly significant for each of the pairs of nils assessed under both of the temperature regimes. the uzu allele reduced fusarium biomass by % and %, respectively, on average across the pairs of nils in the low and high temperature regimes when tri was used as the reference gene. when 18 s was used as the reference gene, the uzu gene reduced fusarium biomass on average by % and %, respectively, across the pairs of nils in the low and high temperature regimes. differences in fusarium biomass between the two isolines for each of the pairs of nils were significantly larger in the high temperature regime when compared with those in the low temperature regime based on the use of either tri or 18 s. correlation between fusarium crown rot severity and plant height plant height was significantly and positively correlated with fcr severity. when fcr severity was measured with di, the correlation coefficients were and for data obtained from the low and the high temperature regimes, respectively. when pathogen biomass was used in measuring fcr severity, the correlation coefficients were and for the low and high temperature regimes, respectively, when tri was used as the reference gene. the correlation coefficients were and for the two different temperature regimes, respectively, when 18 s

resistance in cereals could seriously restrict options breeders may have in exploiting the limited numbers of useful rht genes in wheat or barley. to further investigate this possibility, we generated pairs of nils for the semi-dwarfing barley gene uzu. these nils were assessed under two environments between which significant differences in plant height between the two isolines for a given pair of nils were detected. highly significant difference in fcr resistance was detected between the two isolines for each of the nil pairs and the magnitudes of the differences in fcr resistance are associated with the magnitudes of differences in plant height. it is known that the semi-dwarfism conferred by uzu is not due to changed sensitivity to ga but to brassinosteroids. thus, the results from this study showed that plant height affects fcr resistance in barley and that the height effects are unlikely related to della genes but due to direct or indirect effects of height difference per se. results from previous studies also show that all rht genes, including those non-ga-responsive ones, affect fcr in wheat. there is no ‘cause-and-effect’ that can be implied at this stage yet. however, one of the possible explanations for the reduced fcr severities of the dwarf isolines in both wheat and barley could be their increased cell densities. considering that fcr is measured by the speed of disease spread within the infected tissues, the increased cell densities of dwarfing lines could form increased physical barriers to pathogen spread within infected tissues. this explanation is supported by the findings that treating plants with exogenous ga increased cr severity as well as seedling lengths in all of the isolines tested, and that the better resistance of the dwarf isolines did not seem to be related to enhanced induction of defense genes. it is known that the growth response of wheat seedlings to exogenous ga application is due to cell expansion not cell division. further evidence supporting the explanation that the increased cell density is likely a contributing factor to the reduced fcr severity is that slow growing genotypes tend to give better cr resistance. it is well known that the genetic control of growth rate is complex and can be conditioned by multiple genes including those for vernalization, photoperiod responses as well as those independent of vernalization and day-length. nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to speculate that, when compared with those quick growing genotypes, stem elongation of those slow growing genotypes is slower thus their cell densities at stem bases would stay higher for a longer period of time.  by generating and investigating several pairs of nils for a non-ga-responsive rht gene, we demonstrated in this study that the observed effects of plant height on fcr resistance are not related to della genes in barley. these results agree well with previous data on both fcr and fhb in wheat showing overwhelmingly that the observed effects of plant height on resistances to fcr or fhb can be explained by direct or indirect effects of plant height difference per se. results from the interactions between rht loci and fusarium resistance highlight the importance of understanding the possible relationships between resistance and other traits of agronomic importance. it is critical to understand that the value of a resistance gene in breeding programs could be compromised if it dramatically affects plant development and morphology. the effects of rht genes on fusarium diseases described in this paper showed specifically that caution should be taken when considering exploiting any of the numerous fhb or fcr resistance loci co-locating with rht genes in wheat or barley. "," studies in arabidopsis show that della genes may differentially affect responses to biotrophic and necrophic pathogens. a recent report based on the study of della-producing reduced height genes in wheat and barley also hypothesized that della genes likely increased susceptibility to necrotrophs but increased resistance to biotrophs.  effects of uzu, a non-ga -responsive semi-dwarfing gene, on fusarium crown rot resistance in barley were investigated. fifteen pairs of near isogenic lines for this gene were generated and assessed under two different temperature regimes. similar to its impacts on plant height, the semi-dwarfing gene uzu also showed larger effects on fcr severity in the high temperature regime when compared with that in the low temperature regime.  results from this study add to the growing evidence showing that the effects of plant height on fusarium resistances are unlikely related to della genes but due to direct or indirect effects of height difference per se. the interaction between these two characteristics highlights the importance of understanding relationships between resistance and other traits of agronomic importance as the value of a resistance gene could be compromised if it dramatically affects plant development and morphology. plant heightfusarium crown rotuzu genenear isogenic linesdella proteins ",7f5caa42-5935-4216-a4cc-b051edccce54,pubmed
151," inflammation processes are essential for the immune system of a host organism attacked by bacteria, viruses or other immunogenic molecules. however, persistent inflammation is a pathologic indication. the intestine, being the largest barrier of the human body to the environment, is under a state of persistent controlled inflammation because of its permanent contact with the gut microbiota. intestinal epithelial cells release cytokines and chemokines upon external stimulation, e.g. by bacteria and their surface structures. the factors which trigger inflammation and the release or suppression of cytokines and chemokines have been investigated thoroughly over the last decade, but the process is still not fully understood. clearly, cytokine secretion can be triggered by lipopolysaccharide on the surface of gram-negative bacteria or capsular polysaccharides and lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive species. oligo- and polysaccharides containing fructose have been known for several years as prebiotics. fructose recently was described as a signaling molecule and lead structure for carbohydrates with enhanced antigenicity in hiv vaccination. the extent of the fructan oligo- and polymerization was described as controllable in an enzymatic synthesis process. fructosyltransferases like inulosucrases and levansucrases which synthesize fructans of various chain lengths are common in many different bacteria including the gut microbiota. the challenges to access large, branched oligosaccharides using chemical synthesis, may be overcome using chemo-enzymatic approaches. sucrose analogues synthesized by sacb from b. megaterium were used as precursors for the synthesis of oligofructosides with the fructosyltransferase suc from a. niger. for the present study, the enzymatic synthesis process was scaled up to yield biological test amounts. the tailored oligofructosides tested in this study are capped by the monosaccharides d-glucose, d-mannose, d-galactose, d-fucose or d-xylose, elongated with fructosyl units under tight control of the degree of polymerization. these oligofructosides are supposed to mimic the structural characteristics of immunogenic carbohydrate patterns of antigens, thus triggering the release of cytokines and/or chemokines.  chemo-enzymatic synthesis of novel oligofructosides by substrate engineering of fructosyltransferases tailored oligofructosides were synthesized, purified and characterized regarding their composition and stereochemistry. substrate engineering of two fructosyltransferases from gras organisms leads to novel tailor-made oligofructosides of defined fructosyl backbone lengths. the first step in their enzymatic synthesis is the formation of the α- linked disaccharide. the fructosyltransferase sacb from b. megaterium provides access to the efficient synthesis of sucrose analogues under appropriate reaction conditions. the synthesis reaction was performed according to the process of sucrose analogue synthesis by sacb from b. subtilis. however, sacb from b. megaterium proved to be much more efficient in terms of chemo-enzymatic synthesis with an increased substrate affinity and turnover number. each chemo-enzymatic synthesis process was analyzed by hpaec. as an example, the process for fuc-fru synthesis is shown in figure 3a. the distinct addition of the second and third unit of the fructosyl backbone was performed by the fructosyltransferase suc from a. niger. suc is highly specific for the synthesis of defined tri- and tetrasaccharides, 1-kestose and 1-nystose and their analogues depending on the reaction conditions. trisaccharide kestose analogues are gal- man- xyl- and fuc- tetrasaccharide nystose analogues containing three fructosyl moieties are gal- man- xyl- and fuc-. the previously described products as well as the novel fucosyl-capped tri- and tetrasaccharides were identified and analyzed by tlc and hpaec. scale-up of the synthesis process yields pure oligofructosides in cell culture test amounts. as an example, the synthesis process for fuc-fru and fuc-fru is shown in figure 3b. reaction conditions were suc enzyme dilution 1:, mm sucrose analogue to be converted in sörensen`s phosphate buffer at 45°c and rpm. the reaction time depending on the oligosaccharide to be synthesized is indicated. oligofructoside-stimulated caco- cells differentially secrete cxcl and ccl2 the novel synthesized oligofructosides were tested in terms of immunostimulating properties on human epithelial caco- cells. this cell line is a model for the absorption of pharmacological products in the intestinal region. cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the growth medium during co-cultivation with the novel oligofructosides. caco- cells were grown for h in 24-well dishes containing the oligofructosides to be investigated in a concentration of μm. five-fold repeats of the experiment for each carbohydrate ensured the reproducibility of the results. cxcl and ccl were the only cytokines/chemokines in the media supernatants which led to a significant signal detected by the luminex system. both standard curve fits show a correlation of over 99%. the measured fluorescence intensities are in the linear part of the standard curve indicating the reliability of the data. the other cytokines and chemokines analyzed showed no significant response under these conditions. ccl generally shows a higher signal-to-background enhancement compared to the cultivation of caco- cells without added carbohydrates. the ccl release is increased up to a concentration of pg ml-. the characteristics of a longer fructosyl backbone seem to enhance this effect. for the tetrasaccharides 1-nystose, man-fru, fuc-fru and xyl-fru, the release of ccl is clearly triggered. the stimulation of cxcl is also observable when the fucose-containing 1-nystose analogue fuc-fru is added. also in the case of cxcl longer fructosyl chains seem to enhance the release of this cytokine. in the samples containing man-fru, fuc-fru and xyl-fru the highest concentrations of cxcl were detectable. cxcl and ccl release was consistently not enhanced when incubated with the trisaccharides 1-kestose and man-fru. discussion co-incubation of human epithelial caco- cells with certain types of pure, unconjugated oligofructosides leads to enhanced secretion of cxcl and ccl cxcl is a potent inflammation marker recruiting neutrophils to sites of infection. it is secreted by various cell types including epithelial cells. ccl is described as an effective chemoattractor for monocytes from the blood stream. our results show that ccl release can be clearly triggered by the tetrasaccharide 1-nystose and even more enhanced by the nystose analogues man-fru and fuc-fru the observed differential cytokine secretion pattern raises questions: is this stimulating effect dependent on the carbohydrate structure and if so, which structural elements trigger or suppress the release of cytokines and chemokines? because of the differential secretion pattern and only two significant signals, it was shown that cytokine secretion by caco- cells in this assay is dependent on the oligofructoside type. but why are just significant signals of secreted proteins detectable? one possibility is, that epithelial cells in the intestine only have a restricted repertoire of cytokines to be synthesized and secreted. another point is, that this cell type is in constant contact with ubiquitous nutrients and commensal gut bacteria. hence, it may have evolved tolerance against certain alien structures. the intestine being the largest barrier of the human body to the environment, has a special set of immunologically active cells. this area is under a state of persistent controlled inflammation because of its permanent contact with the gut microbiota. special intestinal macrophages mediate tolerance to beneficial gut bacteria. perturbations of these processes, like the release of ccl inhibit the differentiation of macrophages to imacs thus leading to inflammatory bowel diseases. intestinal epithelial cells release cytokines and chemokines upon external stimulation, e.g. by bacteria and their surface structures. the factors which trigger inflammation and the release or suppression of cytokines and chemokines have been investigated thoroughly over the last decade, but the process is still not fully understood. in this study, mannose- and fucose-capped oligofructosides generally evoke the highest increase in ccl and cxcl release. this might be due to their participation in natural cell-cell communication processes. fucose often is a branching carbohydrate unit e.g. in the lewis x motif. this motif is known as immunogenic under certain conditions, e.g. incomplete sialylation. mannose is part of the core n-glycan structure. its exposition often leads to the release of cytokines, e.g. ccl in mannosidase knock-out mice. interestingly, the different monosaccharide cap structure of the fructosyl backbone is not the only factor influencing the release of cxcl and ccl but also the length of the fructosyl backbone. for example, ccl secretion is triggered by 1-nystose and its tetrasaccharide analogues man-fru and fuc-fru but suppressed by kestose and its analogue man-fru. thus, stereochemical and spatial aspects of oligosaccharides obviously have to be considered in terms of cell signalling processes. recently, it was described that the different shape of bacterial lipopolysaccharide determines which receptor is targeted and thus how cell signalling is processed. the potential target receptors which are known to act competitively are shown in additional file 1: figure s the differential secretion of cytokines and thus the induction of an inflammatory response by the interaction of these receptors is still a scientific area with many long-standing questions.  carbohydrates are ubiquitious structures on the surface of a plethora of different cell types including potentially pathogenic and beneficial gut bacteria. auto-immune diseases like crohn`s disease are linked to persistent, pathologic inflammation. as abundant surface structures of host and pathogen cells, carbohydrates may play an important role in the induction of inflammation and tolerance, respectively. advances in carbohydrate research in combination with cell biology and immunology methods may lead to a detailed understanding of inflammation processes. the pure, tailored carbohydrate structures examined in this study induce such a differential secretion of cytokines in endothelial cells in vitro. further advances in oligosaccharide synthesis lead broadened possibilities to investigate in vivo inflammation mechanisms of carbohydrate-cell receptor crosstalk. controlled stimulation of the immune system may be one component towards a successful treatment of auto-immune diseases. "," it is well known that carbohydrates play fundamental roles in cell signaling and infection processes as well as tumor formation and progression. however, the interaction pathways and cellular receptors targeted by carbohydrates and glycoconjugates remain poorly examined and understood. this lack of research stems, at least to a major part, from accessibility problems of large, branched oligosaccharides.  to test glycan - cell interactions in vitro, a variety of tailored oligosaccharides was synthesized chemo-enzymatically. glycosyltransferases from the gras organisms bacillus megaterium and aspergillus niger were used in this study. substrate engineering of these glycosyltransferases generally acting on sucrose leads to the controlled formation of novel tailored di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides. already industrially used as prebiotics in functional food, the immunogenic potential of novel oligosaccharides was characterized in this study. a differential secretion of cxcl and ccl was observed upon oligosaccharide co-cultivation with colorectal epithelial caco- cells.  pure carbohydrates are able to stimulate a cytokine response in human endothelial cells in vitro. the type and amount of cytokine secretion depends on the type of co-cultivated oligosaccharide. oligofructosideglycosyltransferasesuc1aspergillus nigersacbbacillus megateriumcxcl ccl caco-2 ",43f6f9d7-11da-4631-afee-3328a00aa8e3,pubmed
152," the birth of new neurons in the adult brain takes place in discrete regions, especially in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. following brain insults like stroke, this neurogenic region consistently boosts the generation of newborn neurons, but the mechanisms and functional role of this complex cellular response is only poorly understood. the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus accommodates distinct precursor cell subtypes: radial glial-like type cells give rise to type neuronal progenitors which undergo selection and maturation into functional neurons. these cell types differ in their morphology, proliferative activity, migratory behaviour and expression of different key marker antigens. type cells show a characteristic morphology with a triangle-shaped soma, long and strong apical processes reaching into the granular cell layer and astrocytic properties. those radial glia-like cells express precursor cell markers like nestin and additional the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. transient amplifying precursor cells arising from type cells still express nestin but lack gfap. type cells have plump, short processes orientated parallel to the subgranular zone. afterwards the precursor cells lose their nestin expression and are only positive for doublecortin comprising a transition from a proliferative stage to postmitotic immature neurons. the proliferative activity is significantly increased with the expression of dcx. after exit from the cell cycle the terminal postmitotic differentiation occurs and the cells express markers of mature neurons. the survival of new neurons is determined during the first weeks after their birth and is strongly regulated by neuronal network activity. neurons that have survived this period are incorporated into the hippocampal network. in a previous study we demonstrated that the proliferation of distinct precursor cells in the dentate gyrus increases after focal cortical infarcts. in the present study we further analyzed whether precursor cells constitutively proliferating prior to infarct induction contribute to post-ischemic neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. therefore, the proliferation marker brdu was injected before a focal ischemic infarct was photochemically induced in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex of adult transgenic nestin-gfp mice. these transgenic mice, expressing gfp under the nestin promoter allow a clear identification of distinct nestin-positive precursor subpopulations. using this approach, we demonstrate that focal cortical infarcts sequentially increase newly generated precursor cell subtypes compared to sham-operated controls. we thereby provide evidence that hippocampal precursor cells already generated before the infarct contribute to post-ischemic neurogenesis.  all photothrombotically lesioned animals had typical cortical infarcts located in the sensorimotor cortex according to paxinos. the infarcts impaired all cortical layers leaving the subcortical white matter intact. no structural lesions were observed in sham-operated controls. to study the recruitment of proliferative cells by cortical infarcts young adult animals received injections of the proliferation marker brdu at consecutive days prior to the induction of focal cortical infarcts or sham surgery. the number of brdu-labelled cells was quantified at day and post surgery in the subgranular zone. in both experimental groups the number of brdu-positive cells declined from day reaching to 32% at day after surgery. the slight, but significant increase in number of brdu-positive cells in control animals from day to day is probably caused by unspecific group differences due to a relatively small group size of animals. quantification of brdu-positive cells revealed no significant differences between lesioned and sham-operated animals at day and day but we detected an increased survival of brdu-positive cells at day as well as at day post infarct compared to controls. furthermore we analyzed whether cortical infarcts affect distinct precursor cell populations which already took up brdu prior to the infarct. triple-immunocytochemistry with antibodies against brdu, gfp and gfap or dcx revealed four types of mitotically active precursor cell populations corresponding to the classification described by kempermann and colleagues. type cells express gfap and nestin-gfp and generate nestin-gfp-positive type cells lacking gfap. type cells exist in two subtypes, one negative and one positive for dcx. type 2b cells divide into type cells which are only positive for dcx. newborn mature granule neurons were identified using antibodies against brdu and neun. quantification of these distinct cell types revealed a similar time-course for both experimental groups at day and post surgery. moreover, after focal cortical infarcts we detected a sequential increase of brdu-positive type 2a cells at day of type cells/immature neurons at day and of neun-positive cells at day. at day post surgery the numbers of the precursor cell populations were similar in lesioned and sham-operated animals. dcx-positive type 2b and type cells/immature neurons exhibited the highest numbers of the brdu-expressing cells. the number of brdu-positive type 2b cells decreased at day whereas newborn type cells/immature neurons remained on the same level and mature neurons increase. at this time point the number of newborn type 2a cells showed a 3-fold enhancement in lesioned animals compared to controls. from day the numbers of brdu-positive type 2b, type 3/immature neurons and mature neurons decrease in both groups. but cortical infarcts increase the number of newborn type cells/immature neurons at day and mature neurons at day compared to controls. in contrast to the developmentally later precursor subtypes and mature neurons, the brdu-expressing type and type 2a cells revealed low numbers at all experimental time points in lesioned and control mice. in order to analyze whether changes in proliferative activity of type 2a cells and type cells/immature neurons contribute to the increase of newborn neurons, we additionally stained for ki as an endogenous proliferation marker. using this approach we detected no differences in number of ki67-expressing type 2a cells at day and type cells/immature neurons at day in animals with cortical infarcts and sham-operated controls. these data support our observation that the infarct favours the differentiation and survival of precursor cells constitutively proliferating prior to the insult. taken together, our findings demonstrate that focal cortical infarcts affect precursors generated already before the infarct and significantly enhance their survival. discussion the present findings support our previous reports that small cortical infarcts increase neurogenesis in the young dentate gyrus mainly by promoting the survival of newborn cells. several studies already demonstrated that focal ischemia stimulates the proliferation of dentate precursor cells after infarct induction. we here provide novel data that precursor cells which constitutively divide prior to the infarct significantly contribute to post-lesional neurogenesis. this finding is in agreement with a previous study showing that epileptic activity stimulates dentate precursor cells actively proliferating before the insult. in this study, brdu-labelling one day prior to seizure induction resulted in increased numbers of brdu-positive cells at days to and led to more immature neurons at days to after injury. the time-course of this proliferative response was only slightly delayed after focal cortical infarcts, probably due to different lesion mechanisms. however, large infarcts induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery enhance precursor cell proliferation to days after the lesion. in agreement with kempermann and colleagues we found a non linear decline of brdu-positive cells in our control animals. this group described a survival of approximately 20% of brdu-expressing cells weeks after a period of brdu-injections compared to day which is in accordance with our study. the decrease of brdu-dcx-expressing cells in controls from day until day post surgery in our study is also consistent with a report from brown and colleagues indicating a similar decline mainly between and days after brdu-injections. additionally the proportion of mature neurons among brdu-positive cells weeks after brdu-labelling in a previous report is similar to our findings. the numbers of newborn precursor cell subtypes increase sequentially after the infarct with exception of type 2b cells which were not enhanced at any time point. type 2a cells give rise to type 2b cells which than generate type cells. cortical infarcts increased the number of newborn type 2a cells at day enhanced type cells/immature neurons at day and mature neurons at day after infarcts. we further demonstrate that the enhancement of the newborn mature neurons is mainly caused by an enhanced differentiation and survival of precursor cells born already before the infarct since we could not detect any changes in proliferative activity of these distinct cell types. it is possible that we missed a change in the number of type 2b cells. additionally the absolute number and proliferation rate of the precursor cells might change after infarcts leading to an alteration of type 2b cells which was not detected in our study. we previously demonstrated that proliferation rates and absolute numbers of distinct precursor cell populations differ under physiological conditions. type and type 2a cells exhibit higher absolute cell numbers but fewer dividing cells compared to later precursor cell populations. the mechanisms of post-ischemic neurogenesis are still only poorly understood. glutamatergic mechanisms have been shown to be involved in ischemia-mediated neurogenesis. also interruption of neuronal pathways by stroke may provide a trigger for neurogenesis because induction of hippocampal seizure activity by unilateral perforant path stimulation bilaterally increased dentate neurogenesis. recent studies provide evidence that unilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex, the main excitatory input of granule cells, do not alter the proliferation in the dentate gyrus but bilaterally enhance the survival of newborn neurons. this bilateral increase was also detected in several previous studies using the same model for ischemia as in the present study. furthermore, diffusible and humoral factors might contribute to the neurogenic response in the dentate gyrus. the activation of the transcription factor camp response element-binding protein seems to play an important role for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus under physiological conditions as well as after ischemia. moreover, n-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor-mediated network activity contributes to the selective survival of newborn neurons. to elucidate the functional role of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus a number of hypotheses have been developed. it remains still unexplained why the adult brain responds to insults like stroke with an increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. moreover, increased levels of newborn granule cells generated in the dentate gyrus after stroke correlate with better functional outcomes in several models of focal ischemia when the animals received different types of rehabilitative training.  taken together, the present study provides evidence that focal cortical infarcts affect hippocampal precursor cells, constitutively proliferating prior to infarct induction and enhance their survival. these alterations significantly contribute to increased neurogenesis and elucidate a new aspect of the complex neurogenic response of the dentate gyrus after brain ischemia. "," it is well known that focal ischemia increases neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation but the cellular mechanisms underlying this proliferative response are only poorly understood. we here investigated whether precursor cells which constitutively proliferate before the ischemic infarct contribute to post-ischemic neurogenesis. to this purpose, transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the nestin promoter received repetitive injections of the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine prior to induction of cortical infarcts. we then immunocytochemically analyzed the fate of these brdu-positive precursor cell subtypes from day to day after the lesion.  quantification of brdu-expressing precursor cell populations revealed no alteration in number of radial glia-like type cells but a sequential increase of later precursor cell subtypes in lesioned animals. these alterations result in an enhanced survival of mature neurons weeks postinfarct.  focal cortical infarcts recruit dentate precursor cells generated already before the infarct and significantly contribute to an enhanced neurogenesis. our findings thereby increase our understanding of the complex cellular mechanisms of postlesional neurogenesis.

153," the use of real-time pcr in functional genomics has increased dramatically during the past decade. with this method, the detection of template accumulation in the pcr reaction is based on a fluorescent probe, or a fluorescent dye. the advantages compared to former pcr approaches are many: a: a closed compartment method decreases risk of contamination, as no post-pcr handling is necessary. b: the data used for calculation of quantity are collected as the pcr reaction runs, reducing the time span from pre-pcr procedures to final results are available. c: compared to endpoint analyses of pcr reactions, real-time pcr is unmatched in precision – and d: an extreme dynamic range of 7– log. in the software currently available, analysis of real-time data is generally based on the ""cycle-threshold"" method. some packages offer curve-smoothing and normalisation, but the basic ct algorithm remains unchanged. threshold fluorescence is calculated from the initial cycles, and in each reaction the ct value is defined by the fractional cycle at which the fluorescence intensity equals the threshold fluorescence. a standard curve can be used for absolute quantitation, or the comparative ct method can be used for relative quantitation. the ct method is quite stable and straightforward, so why try to complicate things? the answer is that the precision of estimates is impaired if efficiency is not equal in all reactions. uniform reaction efficiency is the most important assumption of the ct method. the simplest estimate of individual sample efficiency is calculated from the slope of the first part of the log-linear phase, and can be used for identification of outliers or correction of values from individual samples. the sigmoid curve fit or non-linear regression, on the other hand, assumes a dynamic change in efficiency and closely resembles the observed course of fluorescence accumulation during the whole reaction. a further advantage of regression analysis is the possibility to generate estimates of initial copy number directly from the regression estimates, eliminating the need for a standard curve. in small study series, the standard curve may be the best choice – but in a high-throughput production lab, elimination of the standard curve could liberate time and resources. the first obstacle to the use of nlr is that the algorithm needs to be automated. the second and more important obstacle is that proper evaluation is missing both of the comparison of nlr with the ct method, and of the performance of nlr with probe-based chemistry. we therefore decided to develop and evaluate an automated regression model, to test if nlr is a real alternative to the traditional ct method.  altman-bland plots were made of the numerical differences between duplicates vs. duplicate means for each dataset and each regression model and the ct method. these plots showed an increase of error with increasing mean. however, a log transformation of all final estimated values could resolve this pattern, and the error plots showed independence. the intra-assay variation could then be characterised by a percentile of the observed errors. the inverse log of this percentile can be interpreted as factor variation and recalculated to a percentage, as presented in table the mean copy number of duplicates was then analysed in plots of differences between nlr- and ct-derived values vs. means. again, independence could be observed after log transformation of the copy number values, but not in the raw data. in each experiment there was a relative bias, but when comparing the different experiments the bias was clearly not systematic. in figure the bias of model is shown in an altman bland plot containing data from all three experiments. the distribution of the data clouds indicates that each conversion factor varies between experiments in a random manner. the calculated conversion factors ranged from e+ to e+ copies/fluorescence unit. table offers an overview of all models tested and key figures of their performance. the error percentiles stated are calculated on pooled data from all assays, and the bias values are means of pooled numerical bias. as can be seen in figure a simple average of pooled values would yield an erroneously low estimate of the bias, so the overall bias of each regression model has been calculated as an average of numerical bias values. for evaluation of the modifications applied, table offers an overview of resulting r mean, error, and bias changes. discussion ct method in the ct method equal efficiency in all reactions is assumed, and the impact of this assumption on final estimates has been underlined previously. tichopad presented a standardised, automatable algorithm for estimation of sample specific efficiency, and a similar approach was published by ramakers et al. these models calculate efficiency at the early log-linear phase, and assume homogenous efficiency before that. however, calculation of sample specific efficiency was also evaluated by peirson et al, who concluded that this approach was good for detection of outliers, but individual efficiency correction did not improve the precision of absolute quantitation. the ct method has also been combined with curve-smoothing to obtain background correction and data smoothing. the latter approach may produce nice curves, but especially amplitude normalisation will change the slope of the log-linear phase and thereby mask differences in reaction efficiency. nlr theoretically, a calculation of template accumulation that mimics the dynamic change in pcr efficiency, and includes a larger array of the collected fluorescence data, could be more precise than the ct method. alternatives to ct-based calculation have been suggested previously. one model that assumes a dynamic change in efficiency is the sigmoidal curve fit, though limitations apply. especially the late plateau phase of the reaction is difficult to fit in this mathematical model. rutledge suggested removal of observations from the late plateau phase to increase goodness-of-fit to the remaining data. principal objections aside, the latter approach is less well suited for automation. to solve this problem we tested weighted analysis, which performed well in automation but unfortunately did not improve the precision of estimates. automation algorithms for this type of analysis should be independent on user input apart from the raw data, to eliminate user-dependent bias. in general, ""mass production"" techniques should be used with caution in complicated regression models, as small errors may impair the precision of the final estimates. of the models initially investigated in this study, three produced one or more bad fits when automated – which illustrates a potential disadvantage of nlr when compared to ct analysis. the remaining eight models seemed robust, and could be evaluated more thoroughly. model evaluation the r value can be interpreted as ""the amount of observed variation explained by the regression model"". the mean r values in table show that all models generated values above. obviously, differences in the 3rd decimal place of r are not a good measure of model performance, so the altman-bland method is more informative. in the present study, the gold standard ct method has an intra-assay variation of 24%, which is close to previously reported values. this error is a sum of the inaccuracies in fluorescence measurement, thermocycling, pre-pcr procedures, and the ct fractional cycle estimate. most of these inaccuracies are common to both calculation methods. in nlr, or variables are estimated in each analysis, and each of these estimates contain intrinsic error. thus, the resulting intra-assay variation is a combination of inaccuracies in the pre-pcr procedures, equipment errors, and errors in the variable estimates. thus, in effect at least 35% of the total 59% error in model is generated by the mathematical model itself. of the four different modifications to the original model tested, changes in r were minute – but in terms of error all modifications tested had a negative impact on the model, probably due to the increased number of variables estimated. model produced marginally lower bias and marginally higher error, and this is the only modification that was not directly harmful to model performance. the high-performance assays used in this study are an optimal setting for ct analysis, and our evaluation may therefore be quite conservative in terms of demonstrating the advantages of nlr. in assays with varying pcr efficiency, the nlr method may yet prove to be more precise than the ct method. this, however, awaits systematic evaluation. conversion factor the use of an absolute conversion factor, or optical calibration, has been evaluated previously in different analysis models. the three data clouds in figure were generated with separate conversion factors, and their distribution shows a pattern of random variation, underlining that our conversion factor assessment was inaccurate. however, the conversion factor only affects the absolute sample value and not the intra-assay variation, nor the rank position of a sample in the data set. probe-based chemistry theoretically offers a stoichiometric calibration, as each probe has one reporter and one quencher molecule. in effect, the conversion factor should be universal and independent on the template measured. the conversion factors calculated in this series ranged × from lowest to highest, and this also indicates that the precision of our conversion factors was less than optimal. stoichiometric calibration was investigated in detail by swillens et al, who lowered probe concentration to define probe as the limiting factor of fluorescence accumulation. this approach assumes a precise probe concentration and a 100% conjugation and purity. as the problem of signal to noise ratio is inherent in all probe-based assays, a reduction of probe concentration lowers the detection window even further and may impair precision. alternative mathematical models for curve smoothing combined with the ct method, the sigmoidal curve fit may not be optimal – as the gompertz function shows a better fit both with the steep increase phase and the late plateau phase. the gompertz algorithm is not suitable for estimation of initial fluorescence, though. to calculate the initial copy number accurately, the efficiency of each cycle must be estimated: n0=ncte0×e1×…×ect−1

in theory each of these efficiencies could be measured directly on the fluorescence curve. in practice, however, only a few points on the pcr curve yield workable efficiency estimates because the early plateau phase is dominated by background noise. rutledge recently proposed an alternative model for estimation of maximal efficiency based on the sigmoidal model. as the efficiency is directly calculable in the log-linear phase, the important extremes of efficiency can be assessed. further work will show if this model is workable, or if it will fall short on the problem of multiple estimates.  nlr is automatable and may be a powerful tool for analysis of fluorescence data from real-time pcr experiments. the unfavourable signal to noise ratio of the probe-based assays did not impair nlr analysis. the versatility of nlr depends on the precision needed – but if adaptable, this analysis method may save both time and resources in the laboratory. further work is needed as to improve precision of the fluorescence-copy number conversion factor in order to reduce the bias observed in this study. it is indeed possible to obtain absolute quantitation from real-time data without a standard curve. in an optimised assay, however, the ct method remains the gold standard due to the inherent errors of the multiple estimates used in nlr. "," in real-time pcr data analysis, the cycle threshold method is currently the gold standard. this method is based on an assumption of equal pcr efficiency in all reactions, and precision may suffer if this condition is not met. nonlinear regression analysis or curve fitting has therefore been suggested as an alternative to the cycle threshold method for absolute quantitation. the advantages of nlr are that the individual sample efficiency is simulated by the model and that absolute quantitation is possible without a standard curve, releasing reaction wells for unknown samples. however, the calculation method has not been evaluated systematically and has not previously been applied to a taqman platform. aim: to develop and evaluate an automated nlr algorithm capable of generating batch production regression analysis.  total rna samples extracted from human gastric mucosa were reverse transcribed and analysed for tnfa, il and actb by taqman real-time pcr. fluorescence data were analysed by the regular ct method with a standard curve, and by nlr with a positive control for conversion of fluorescence intensity to copy number, and for this purpose an automated algorithm was written in spss syntax. eleven separate regression models were tested, and the output data was subjected to altman-bland analysis. the altman-bland analysis showed that the best regression model yielded quantitative data with an intra-assay variation of 58% vs. 24% for the ct derived copy numbers, and with a mean inter-method deviation of ×.  nlr can be automated for batch production analysis, but the ct method is more precise for absolute quantitation in the present setting. the observed inter-method deviation is an indication that assessment of the fluorescence conversion factor used in the regression method can be improved. however, the versatility depends on the level of precision required, and in some settings the increased cost effectiveness of nlr may justify the lower precision.

154," bacteria that form biofilms have been shown to be highly resistant to antimicrobial therapy and contribute to the chronic nature of many bacterial infections in humans because cells in biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. developing effective treatments for biofilm-related infections requires an understanding of the processes that lead biofilms to persist in the face of antimicrobial treatment. there are multiple hypotheses to explain biofilm persistence during antibiotic treatment. physical factors, like diffusion limitation, may prevent antibiotic concentrations from reaching inhibitory or lethal levels within biofilms. however, several studies report biofilm persistence despite substantial antibiotic diffusion. another hypothesis posits that non-genetic phenotypic heterogeneity, including the plastic expression of phenotypes that are resistant to antibiotics, may occur in biofilms. for example, resource gradients may lead cells to experience different microenvironments and thus express distinct phenotypes in different parts of a biofilm. in particular, a “persister” phenotype has been hypothesized to arise in biofilms and provide immunity against antibiotics. these persister cells are postulated to have the ability to reconstitute biofilms upon release from antibiotic threat. alternatively, bacteria cultured as biofilms may evolve heritable variation for resistance to antibiotics de novo. we know that evolutionary change can occur rapidly within tens to hundreds of generations, which are time scales relevant to medical treatment of infectious diseases. furthermore, bacteria in biofilms have huge population sizes so that many new mutations will arise over relatively short time scales. it is possible that antibiotic resistance might arise in bacterial biofilms through straightforward population genetic processes. we suggest that, given enough time, variation in antibiotic resistance may arise in biofilms even in the absence of antibiotic selection. this could happen due to the accumulation of neutral variation or as a result of selection for phenotypes that by happenstance are correlated with antibiotic resistance. evolutionary change in biofilms is plausible since recent studies have shown tremendous phenotypic variation among cells isolated from biofilms growing in patients and demonstrated heritable variation in traits within experimentally cultured biofilm populations. however, few hypotheses about antibiotic resistance in biofilms invoke evolutionary change as an alternative explanation for biofilm persistence during antibiotic treatment. evolution could involve mutations that convey resistance to single antibiotics or to whole suites of antibiotics. the occurrence of variants resistant to antibiotics may provide an “insurance effect” by creating subpopulations of cells that can survive or even proliferate should the biofilm come under antibiotic assault. resistant variants could thus facilitate reconstitution of bacterial biofilm populations following cessation of antibiotic treatment. documenting whether genetic variation for antibiotic resistance arises during the course of biofilm development is an important first step to exploring biofilm persistence in the face of antibiotic treatment. as we suggest, evolutionary explanations predict that genetic variation in the susceptibility to antibiotics will arise in biofilms, and that the frequency of antibiotic resistant cells will increase through time. here we demonstrate the rapid evolution of heritable variation for broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance during the course of biofilm development by e. coli. we tested three hypotheses in this work: heritable variation for antibiotic resistance evolves during biofilm development; this variation includes both resistant and susceptible mutants to a range of antibiotics; and phenotypic variation in biofilms increases through time. we found evidence for both and but not. variation in antibiotic resistance emerged within days of biofilm growth, a time frame that is consistent with many common bacterial infections. thus, these findings have important implications for the development of treatments for bacteria that form biofilms during infection.  we cultured escherichia coli k mg as biofilms in the absence of antibiotics. briefly, we inoculated e. coli into flow-cells and cultured biofilms using minimal medium with glucose as a sole carbon source. we sampled biofilm populations at and days and isolated ten bacterial clones from three replicate flow cells at each time point. using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method, we characterized each bacterial clone for resistance to twelve antibiotics by measuring the diameters of zones of inhibition for each clone on each antibiotic. 1based on sensi-disks from bd. numbers following letters indicate ug of antibiotic applied to each disk. we tested whether heritable variation for antibiotic resistance evolved during biofilm development by assessing change in mean zoi for the biofilm-derived clones relative to the ancestor. we observed the evolution of statistically significant differences in antibiotic resistance in biofilms, with clones that were more sensitive or more resistant appearing independently in each of our replicates. the data used for the analysis was formatted to create a balanced design matrix. using a set of nine planned contrasts, we found significant changes in the mean evolved resistance for several antibiotics through time. many evolved clones also showed increased susceptibility to antibiotics. although resistant clones were uncommon in our experiments, when they appeared in evolved biofilms, they did so at notable frequencies. for some combinations of antibiotics and sampling times, multiple samples from evolved biofilms showed higher variability than seen among multiple samples from the ancestral clone. these findings support hypotheses and 2; genetic variation in levels of resistance to antibiotics evolves during biofilm development in the absence of antibiotics, and this variation includes both resistant and sensitive clones. there was no evidence of increased variation through time in our data. symbols denote direction of change: ↓ = smaller zoi for latter group, ↑ = larger zoi for latter group. our results suggest that antibiotic resistance and susceptibility can rapidly evolve in biofilms over relatively short time scales, which begs the question of how these rates of mutation accumulation compare to those in well-mixed liquid cultures that support exponential growth. such a comparison is difficult because estimating the “mutation rate” in the spatially structured bacterial cells of biofilms is problematic. mutation rates are almost always calculated and compared on a “per-generation” basis, but rates of bacterial cell division in biofilms vary widely depending on location within the biofilm matrix. this variation in cellular growth rates is a consequence of nutrient depletion and the creation of strong gradients of substrates, electron acceptors and other resources within the spatially structured environment of biofilms. these gradients cause growth rates to vary tremendously within biofilms, such that cells deep within the biofilm matrix may not divide at all. because of this, mutation frequency cannot be expressed in the same terms, i.e., per generation, as in well-mixed liquid cultures; nor can one calculate a meaningful population-wide average growth rate for cells in biofilms. one can imagine applying models that account for differential growth in biofilms, and then using current data to calculate mutation rates that can be compared to rates in well-mixed cultures. however, such calculations require data about mutation rates in in non-growing bacterial cells that is largely lacking, so direct and simple comparisons between biofilms and well-mixed cultures are not possible at this time. the evolution of antibiotic resistance and susceptibility in bacterial biofilms involves the interaction between mutation, selection, genetic drift, and spatial structure. the data presented here cannot determine the importance of these multiple explanatory factors. it seems likely that evolution in biofilms typically occurs under conditions contrary to what is typically assumed in standard population genetics theory and rather involves strong mutational mechanisms typical in bacteria under stress coupled with weak selection. future work combining spatially explicit models for biofilm growth with model-based estimates of mutation rates and effect sizes for bacteria would provide more insight into the details of evolution in biofilms.  these data show the rapid de novo evolution of heritable variation in antibiotic sensitivity and resistance during e. coli biofilm development. we suggest that evolutionary processes, whether genetic drift or natural selection, should be considered as a factor to explain the elevated tolerance to antibiotics typically observed in bacterial biofilms. we do not yet know whether evolution of antibiotic resistance requires high rates of mutation as can arise in biofilms or can be explained by normal mutation rates in bacteria. in either case, biofilms quickly evolve high levels of variation in antibiotic resistance. we hypothesize that rare, highly resistant variants may allow biofilms to regrow following antibiotic treatment. this mechanism is an important potential explanation for why biofilm populations are, in general, highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. "," explanations for bacterial biofilm persistence during antibiotic treatment typically depend on non-genetic mechanisms, and rarely consider the contribution of evolutionary processes.  using escherichia coli biofilms, we demonstrate that heritable variation for broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance can arise and accumulate rapidly during biofilm development, even in the absence of antibiotic selection.  our results demonstrate the rapid de novo evolution of heritable variation in antibiotic sensitivity and resistance during e. coli biofilm development. we suggest that evolutionary processes, whether genetic drift or natural selection, should be considered as a factor to explain the elevated tolerance to antibiotics typically observed in bacterial biofilms. this could be an under-appreciated mechanism that accounts why biofilm populations are, in general, highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. evolutionantibiotic resistancebacterial biofilmsmutationsdiversity ",f85a4242-579b-42a3-b998-c13580015036,pubmed
155," cranial cruciate ligament rupture is one of the most important stifle injuries and a common cause of lameness in dogs. cclr results in joint instability and leads to the development of degenerative joint disease over time. kinetic analysis is commonly employed for objective lameness evaluation in horses and dogs, among other species. peak vertical force and vertical impulse are the most accurate parameters for lameness diagnosis and can be measured using pressure sensitive walkways. pvf and vi are significantly decreased in dogs with cclr. vertical force redistribution studies in dogs with cclr report a significant overload of the contralateral limb. similar to pedobarographic analysis in humans, the isolated analysis of specific areas of the limb during the stance phase of the stride can be performed in dogs using modern kinetic analysis equipment. data obtained via these methods can be relevant when clinical decisions and patient follow-up are based on improved weight bearing. studies on vertical forces in the pads of dogs are scarce and unrelated to orthopedic disease. the aim of this study was to analyze vertical forces in the pads of dogs affected with cclr. the description of pvf and vi in dogs with cclr may contribute for a broader understanding of the changes that result in decreased weight bearing in these patients. it may also represent a more comprehensive method for patient follow-up and the critical evaluation of the surgical techniques currently employed to treat the condition. methods this research was approved by the bioethics committee of the faculty of veterinary medicine and animal science of the university of são paulo – fmvz/usp. ten healthy pitbulls and pitbulls presenting with unilateral cclr were used in this study. previous informed consent was given for the owners. all dogs were submitted to physical and radiographic examination, and the tibial thrust test prior to kinetic analysis. dogs were aged between and 6 years and weighed between and 36 kg. exclusion criteria were obesity, cachexia, pregnancy, estrous, history of previous orthopedic surgery, concurrent systemic or orthopedic disease, and medication of any kind over the preceding 4 weeks. kinetic analysis kinetic analysis was performed on a × -m pressure sensitive walkwaya equipped with a series of plates instrumented with a total of sensors and connected to a dedicated computer. five valid trials were evaluated for each dog. valid trials consisted of controlled velocity and acceleration in a straight line without sidestepping or deviation of the head. out of a maximum of consecutive passages recorded, valid trials were selected for each dog. the first passages were always excluded to avoid data collection before dogs were familiar with the setup. only full stride cycles recorded in the middle of the platform were considered. the same operator was responsible for valid trail selection and analysis. to avoid potential interferences with kinetic analysis trials were always performed in the morning, before physical examination and before daily physical activities were resumed. before each session all sensors were calibrated according to a known standard weight. all trials were started meters before the walkway, so that dogs had enough room to complete two full stride cycles before stepping on the platform. walking velocity varied between and  m/s and acceleration was kept below ±   m/s velocity was given by the software as stride length divided by the duration of the stride cycle. acceleration was controlled based on the difference between initial and final velocity divided by time. for increased strictness and to assure constant velocity, only stance phases with a variation of ±   seconds between consecutive foot strikes were considered for each leg. dogs were walking fast during data collection in this study. given gait analysis at the trot was not intended, only duty factors above 50% were considered. duty factor ranged from to %. peak vertical force and vertical impulse were calculated from the vertical force curve generated automatically by the softwareb. for each foot strike evaluated, measurements of pvf and vi were obtained from metacarpal/metatarsal pads and digital pads and these areas were manually outlined according to previously reported methods. statistical analysis normal distribution of the data was investigated using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. analysis of variance and the tukey test were used to compare the means and to assess the differences between groups and among pads in the same limb within each group. gait symmetry between the right and left limbs in control dogs and between the healthy and the diseased limb in cclr dogs was assessed using the paired student’s t test. the level of significance was set at 5%. sample power greater than 80% confirmed the quality of the data.  the cclr group consisted of intact males and intact females weighing  ±   kg and aged  ±   years. all dogs in this group had a history of lameness of at least 1 month duration but were not showing signs of acute lameness at the time of data collection. all dogs had been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but had completed the minimum washout period. the control group consisted of intact males and intact females weighing  ± 5 kg and aged  ±   years. age and body weight did not differ between groups. mean pvf and vi values expressed as percentage of body weight and respective standard deviations are summarized in tables  and pvf = peak vertical force; vi = vertical impulse. groups with different letters in the same row are significantly different. mean values expressed as % of body weight. groups with different letters

case letter – column. mean values expressed as % of body weight. no gait asymmetries were observed in the control group. however, important differences were observed in cclr dogs. pvf and vi were lower in affected limb than in the contralateral limb and in the fore limbs when compared to control, indicating that the affected limb, particularly the contralateral limb, is spared at the expense of the remaining limbs in cases of cclr. given no gait asymmetries were observed in the control group, the left and right front and hindlimbs were grouped together and used as a reference for pad evaluation. in the cclr group, the most prominent decrease in pvf was documented in the metatarsal pad of the affected limb. mean pvf values in digital pads and were similar to mean values recorded in control dogs. vertical force curves of healthy hindlimbs and hindlimbs with cclr are shown in figure  discussion kinetic analysis is more sensitive than subjective evaluation for lameness diagnosis in dogs. although craniocaudal forces can also be measured using force plates, such forces are less reliable than pvf and vi for lameness diagnosis in dogs due to greater variability. vertical forces have 90% sensitivity and specificity for lameness detection and can be accurately documented using pressure sensitive walkways, as performed in this study. despite the wide popularity of kinetic analysis, studies on kinetic analysis in canine pads are scarce. changes in vertical forces lead to a decrease in pvf and vi in dogs with cclr. the few kinetic studies on load distribution in canine pads published to date report important contribution of the metatarsal pad for total weight bearing in german shepherds, labradors and greyhounds. in this study, the lower mean vertical forces documented in cclr dogs reflected decreased weight bearing on the metatarsal pad in particular. while vertical forces in the affected limb corresponded to approximately 70% of the mean values documented in control dogs, vertical forces on the metatarsal pad were as low as 30% of controls. the effect of breed on limb and pad kinetic analysis has been reported in dogs. therefore dogs of the same breed were used in this study. all dogs had a history of lameness of at least 1 month duration. lameness may be more severe in acute cases or shortly after surgery. as previously reported, the classical m-shape of the vertical force curve reflects the specific dynamics involved in the stance phase of the stride, that begins with braking and ends with propulsion as the dogs lifts the limb off ground. the first vertical force peak corresponds to the maximum force generated during braking and is followed by a second peak representing the maximum force generated by propulsion. the valley between both peaks represents the movement of the limb from footstrike to toe off. the characteristic m-shaped pattern may be absent in faster gaits, particularly in the front limbs. a single force peak may then be visualized due to superimposition of the force peaks corresponding to footstrike and toe off respectively. in this study, the m-shaped waveform typically seen during walking was observed in healthy hindlimbs, but not in hindlimbs affected with cclr. whenever the m-shaped waveform was observed the first vertical force peak was associated with the metacarpal or the metatarsal pad and the second with the digital pads, particularly the 3rd and 4th hindlimb pads. vertical forces are usually distributed among all pads during the stance phase of the stride in dogs. however, our results suggest that the aforementioned areas were possibly responsible for a higher percentage of weight bearing and for the braking and propulsion vertical force peaks. this may be related to cclr given the braking phase of the stride is one of the most affected by the instability of the joint due to the cranial movement of the tibia, as simulated during physical examination using the tibial thrust test. vertical force magnitude in metatarsal pad may thus constitute an important parameter for post-surgical follow-up of cclr cases. vertical force measurements may also indirectly aid in the identification of residual joint instability with potential impact on weight bearing, as shown in ex vivo studies. weight bearing can also be measured based on craniocaudal force measurements although this method is less accurate due to lower force magnitudes and greater variability. also, craniocaudal force measurements require the use of a force plate for evaluation of forces generated in three orthogonal planes during movement. conversely, vertical forces may be measured in any pressure sensitive walkway at a lower cost. a setup containing a series of instrumented plates capable of sampling a complete stride cycle during the same passage would reduce examination time and the degree of physical exertion required from subjects, while permitting consistent data collection. good quality portable craniocaudal force measurement systems and pressure sensitive walkways are currently available and yield reliable data despite differences in calibration and pvf readings.  the results of this study suggest that evaluation of vertical forces in the pads using pressure sensitive walkways may be a promising method for evaluation of dogs with cclr. the application of this diagnostic tool in other orthopedic diseases that are currently evaluated based on conventional kinetic analysis may also contribute for increased understanding of the weight bearing changes observed in affected dogs. the relevance of kinematic analysis of the tibiotarsal joint in dogs predisposed to cclr has been reported and important changes in weight bearing have been observed in the distal limb of affected dogs in this study. a comprehensive assessment of locomotion in these patients may be invaluable for critical evaluation of the surgical techniques currently employed to treat the condition.

156," an important goal of microarray studies with two classes is to identify genes, for further investigation, that ""explain"" much of the class differences. one common approach is to look separately at genes that exhibit high differential expression. the disadvantage of this approach is that it ignores the role of gene combinations in leading to good classification. another approach is to investigate classification rules for combinations of genes. while this approach accounts for gene interactions, too often these rules involve so many genes that it is difficult to determine those genes that are not included simply by chance. our strategy is to look for classification rules that perform well with few genes, so as to have a stronger ""signal"" to detect genes that contribute most to good classification. there are various approaches to developing classification rules for microarrays and identifying genes for further investigation. almost all approaches involve a split of the data into training and test samples. in the training sample a classification rule is developed, and in the test sample its performance is determined. two common measures of performance are cross-validation and multiple random validation. in k-fold cross-validation, the data are divided into k subsets. on each iteration of the cross-validation a different collection of the k- subsets serve as the training sample and the remaining subset serves as the test sample. the performance of the classification rule is the average performance in the k test samples. in multiple random validation, the data are randomly split into training and test samples many times. unlike cross-validation, the goal is not to average performance over test samples but to investigate the variability of performance over test samples and the frequencies of genes selected on random splits. there are also various approaches for formulating a classification rule in the training sample. one common approach, called a filter, selects genes with the best individual performances prior to formulation of the classification rule. another common approach, called a wrapper, splits the training sample into a training-training sample and a training-test sample and uses cross-validation within the training sample to both select genes and formulate a classification rule. unlike a filter, a wrapper can identify genes that perform poorly individually but well together, but the price is likely increased variability in the measure of performance due to a small training-test sample. importantly, both approaches for gene selection involve a threshold for the number of genes to include in a classification rule. without a threshold it is possible to obtain excellent classification in the training sample that would likely do poorly in the test sample because the classification rule has been overly tailored to the training sample. the threshold is either specified in advance or determined by a performance criterion and typically yields a moderate to large number of genes the identification of a moderate number of genes is theoretically desirable because the genes likely form a network. however we are concerned that, despite the use of refined approaches, it is more likely that with classification rules involving a moderate number of genes rather than a few genes, that some genes will be detected by chance therefore our goal was to identify classification rules that perform well with the fewest genes, and so may be more ""robust"" than rules with more genes. importantly with fewer genes in the classification rule, it is easier to identify genes with relatively high frequencies in multiple random validation. such genes are most likely to represent a true ""signal."" the identification of a few genes that contribute to good classification and are not likely detected by chance allows investigators to better focus further research efforts, perhaps leading to easier clinical application, simpler dissemination of results, and possibly improved scientific insights. although our general strategy could be applied to any of a variety of microarray classification techniques, we chose a simple approach. for classification we used a filter and the nearest centroid rule, which is easy to implement and has been previously shown to perform well. to measure performance in a comprehensive manner that captures errors in assignments to both classes, we used receiver operating characteristic curves and the estimated area under the roc curve, which ranges from 1/ for chance classification to for perfect classification. to characterize chance variability we used the previously mentioned multiple random validation procedure that involves repeated random splits of training and test samples. we analyzed data from four published microarray studies involving colon cancer, leukemia, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer. see table although multiple random validation strategy had been used with the colon cancer, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer data sets, these analyses did not involve a comparison of performances for few versus many genes.  the classification performance generally improved as the number of genes in the classification rule increased from to to to with small decreases in improvement likely due to chance. see figure and table because the classification for the medulloblastoma data was poor with an estimated auc not significantly better than chance, we only report in detail the results for the three other data sets. for these data sets, the performance of the classification rule was more similar between rules with and genes than between rules with and genes, particularly when considering the lower bound of the estimated auc. results when the training sample split was one half the data are given below. for the colon cancer data set the estimated auc was.,.,., and. with and genes respectively; for leukemia data set it was.,.,., and. for and genes, respectively; and for the breast cancer data set it was.,.,., and. for and genes, respectively. similar results were obtained with a four-fifths split into the training sample. for the three data sets in which the classification rule for genes performed well, we investigated the classification rule for genes to determine if any genes had relatively high frequencies of selection. gene histograms are shown in figure for the breast cancer data set, no gene had a relatively high frequency. for the colon cancer data set, the human desmin gene had a relatively high frequency. human desmin is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of skeletal muscle. desmin has also been used in a study of colon cancer as a marker for fat storing cells, and, in a study of colon polyps from cases, all were negative for desmin. for the leukemia data the zyxin gene had a high relative frequency, 44%, 34%, and 31% when the training sample contained four-fifths the data.) zyxin plays a pivotal role in mitosis. after completing our analysis, we found that other investigators of the same data set identified zyxin has the most significant feature for classification, discussed some possible biological links, and recommended further investigation of the role of zyxin in leukemia. secretory granule proteoglycan was the other gene with high relative frequency in the leukemia data set when the training sample contained four-fifths of the data. the peptide core of a secretory granule proteoglycan, serglycin, has been implicated in gene methylation of leukemia cells. methylation is an important process in the regulation of expression in many genes. serglycin is also involved in the formation of granules in neutrophil granulocytes. granules are important for distinguishing the two classes of leukemias. interestingly secretory granule proteoglycan was not listed among identified genes in other classifications of these data. discussion other classification rules for the same data sets performed similarly to ours; however precise comparison of misclassification rates is not meaningful due to differences in the validation procedures, particularly when there was no random splitting of training and test samples. in terms of methodology for gene selection and classification, there are several related approaches: a filter with multiple random validation of the entire sample, a wrapper with multiple random validation of the entire sample, and a wrapper with multiple random cross-validation within the training sample and no independent test sample. see table our approach can be viewed either as a wrapper with multiple random validation and a training-test sample instead of a test sample or a filter with multiple random validation of the entire sample. these related approaches computed either gene frequencies or a relevancy measure that can be viewed as a frequency when the weights equal our general strategy of finding classification rules with few genes that perform well and then identifying genes with relatively high frequencies under multiple random validation applies to both classification rules with filters and wrappers. future research using a wrapper would be of great interest because of the potential of the wrapper to identify genes that have good classification when considered together but poor classification when considered separately. the inclusion of additional genes in the classification rule can affect performance in one of two ways depending on whether or not the additional genes are predictive of outcome or not. if the additional genes are not predictive, the performance of the rule in the test sample will likely worsen due to additional ""noise"". if the additional genes are predictive, then performance in the test sample will improve with more ""signals."" improvement in performance is greatest if the additional predictive genes are independent and smaller if the additional predictive genes are correlated. in our microarray studies, which showed small gains in performance with additional genes, the genes were likely predictive and correlated. our goal is to identify genes with high relative frequencies of selection in the classification rule with few genes. it is important to consider only classification rules with few genes because with moderate numbers of genes in the classification rules, many genes invariably appear in nearly all the classification rule and hence there is a concern that many genes are included by chance. with few genes in the classification rule, one can sometimes find, as in two of our data sets, one or two genes with relatively high frequencies, which seems like a strong ""signal"" that these genes make a real contribution to classification and are hence worthy of further study. it is, however, possible that many highly associated genes could have similarly high frequencies of occurrence in classification rules with few genes and one should be aware of this potential scenario. throughout this study we have been ""conservative"" in our identification of genes for further study by trying to rule out, as much as possible, the role of chance in explaining good classification. hence we used multiple random validation and focused on as few genes as possible. we also wanted our measure of performance to be as informative as possible by using roc curves. the 95% confidence intervals we report are only approximate because they are based on repeated sampling from a finite population, namely to specimens. however for our purposes, approximate confidence intervals are acceptable, because the main focus is not precisely estimating the variability of classification performance but rather the identification of genes that make a strong contribution to good classification performance.  a relevant quote attributed to the noted mathematician henri poincare is, ""science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. but a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house."" often investigators report large numbers of genes that are either differentially expressed or constitute a classification rule, but which, due to the influence of chance, may be more of a ""heap of stones"" than part of a ""house."" to confidently identify the basic ""building blocks"" for classification of cancer outcomes, investigators should use multiple random validation to find classification rules that perform well with few genes and select genes with relatively high frequencies of occurrence in these classification rules. "," the goal of most microarray studies is either the identification of genes that are most differentially expressed or the creation of a good classification rule. the disadvantage of the former is that it ignores the importance of gene interactions; the disadvantage of the latter is that it often does not provide a sufficient focus for further investigation because many genes may be included by chance. our strategy is to search for classification rules that perform well with few genes and, if they are found, identify genes that occur relatively frequently under multiple random validation.  we analyzed data from four published studies related to cancer. for classification we used a filter with a nearest centroid rule that is easy to implement and has been previously shown to perform well. to comprehensively measure classification performance we used receiver operating characteristic curves. in the three data sets with good classification performance, the classification rules for genes were only slightly worse than for or genes and somewhat better than for gene. in two of these data sets, one or two genes had relatively high frequencies not noticeable with rules involving or genes: desmin for classifying colon cancer versus normal tissue; and zyxin and secretory granule proteoglycan genes for classifying two types of leukemia.  using multiple random validation, investigators should look for classification rules that perform well with few genes and select, for further study, genes with relatively high frequencies of occurrence in these classification rules.

157," cell-based screening of the cytotoxic activity of chemical compounds in cancer cells has emerged as a widely used method in the drug discovery process. typically, cells are treated with several concentrations of compound in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates for a predefined time period. a common method to evaluate these experiments in a quantitative fashion is to determine a half-maximal inhibitory concentration for which cell growth is inhibited by 50%. comprehensive efforts have been focused on screening experiments with thousands of compounds in industrial laboratories as well as institutions of public health. a screen of cancer cell lines with a large library of agents was supervised by the national cancer institute. yet, these compound screens lack a standardized tool and implementation for automatic high-throughput evaluation. we propose the methods and software applied for evaluation in a screen of non-small cell lung cancer in vitro cell cultures as a standard for cell line screens in future. the implementation is available for download under the general publice license. implementation evaluation and validation of compound screens for l =..., k, consider the screen of the lth compound in log-transformed concentrations xlj with j =..., ml. on the other hand, denote by ylij the observed proportion of cells still being alive under concentration j in the ith replicate where i =..., nl. this determines nl dose-response curves formed by the respective points,...,. one ic value can be determined from each of these by the preimage cli of the 50% point under a linear spline. in real experiments, this value may not be uniquely determined as the curve crosses the 50% point several times. in these cases, it is most appropriate to define the ic value as the smallest concentration where this occurs. the resulting ic from the repeated screen is determined as the mean c¯l of these nl concentrations with a 95% confidence interval cl∈, making use of the fact that the ic concentrations are normally distributed through the above logarithmic transformation which is inverted subsequently after analysis. here, σ^ denotes the standard deviation of the nl values. if most samples are resistant towards a particular compound in the overall screen, we propose to determine the 25% inhibitory concentration instead to get a more widespread profile for that sample. to guess the accuracy of an experiment, one point of interest is the variability of the resulting ic values. this can be determined by the coefficient of variation v^l of these. on the other hand, the standard deviations of the raw data σ^lj can be determined for each concentration to verify the initial validity of the measurements. as this results in a total of ml values, it is reasonable to regard the maximum σ^l:=max⁡{σ^l...,σ^lm} of these values as the overall accuracy of the data points. features of the r package the novel add-on package'ic50' is available for download from the comprehensive r archive network and provides automatic performance of the above evaluation methods. the functions of the package are appropriate for immediate use on the r console but can be accessed by an intuitive gui as well. the main feature that makes the described tool exceedingly useful for practice is that all data in an arbitrary directory on the local harddisk can be evaluated simultaneously by just one mouse click. in particular, the amount of data to be evaluated is not limited and may comprise screens of hundreds or thousands of compounds or samples, respectively, as long as the same design is shared by all experiments. microtiter plates with or wells are supported up to now. raw data are expected to be passed as tab-delimited text files which are the typical output from appropriate microplate readers. the arrangement of the measurements on the well matrix can be different for each experimental setup. to address this, the design can be configured by three separate files, one specifying the coordinates of the wells for the actual compound measurements, one for the locations of control measurements to be used for normalization and a third for specification of the respective concentrations used for each measurement. several samples of such files are distributed together with the package. normalization with control wells can be performed by taking the mean of a specified control row or by one single control well per concentration, where wells can be used multiple times in both cases. inhibitory percentages can be configured as 50% for all compounds, which is default, or any other individual value, e.g. to calculate ic values. graphical output can be modified by additional options. as for any r package, there is detailed documentation of all features available with additional examples for illustration and a step-by-step tutorial document guiding the user to prepare his data and configuration files for analysis with the tool.  results from an evaluation of the lung cancer cell line h under treatment with different compounds are given in table with the corresponding dose-response curves for gefitinib and su in figure the measurements were carried out using a mithras lb multimode reader with the output files converted to tab-delimited text files before the procedure. in general, the numeric results are all given in one single text file with the structure of table and a graphics output as exemplified in figure is written to one single pdf file in the specified output directory for all compounds in the screen. the cell line h carries an activating mutation of the egfr gene making it sensitive to the egfr inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. the full data collection of this compound screen will be published elsewhere. results of the dose-response experiment for the egfr-mutant h nsclc cell line treated with small molecule compounds 17aag, purvalanol, su gefitinib, rapamycin, vx and u the lowest ic value reveals strong activity of gefitinib, whereas the na values indicate that the sample is resistant to su treatment and no ic value was calculated. the columns clow and cup show the 95% confidence interval for the ic values. the maximum of the standard deviations of the measurements is given in the column, whereas in the last column, v denotes the coefficient of variation of the ic values. for a resistant sample, a typical curve looks like figure 2b with no remarkable variation of viability over the concentrations. for the ic concentration, the tool returns a na value in this case and does not include it into the plot. the same happens if the viability is almost constant at a somewhat lower percentage and ). however, other kinds of unexpected behaviour may occur in real experiments. the curve can be non-monotonic and cross the 50% point several times ). as mentioned above, the smallest of the several concentrations is returned in this case. on the other hand, erroneous measurements may yield a monotonically increasing curve with viability below 50% even for small concentrations ). in this case, the tool returns a na value for the ic concentration. the lowest ic value in the h cells was observed under gefitinib treatment, thus confirming the appropriateness of our screening and analytical approaches. for the coefficient of variation, a usual standard is to require v < for reasonable accuracy. regarding the results in table the maximum standard deviation ranges between and, suggesting an upper threshold of τ = for validation. the measurements for rapamycin show very strong variability with an artificially wide confidence interval. for the cell line screen, this result was therefore discarded and replaced by a repeated experiment.  in summary, the'ic50' package provides a platform for time-efficient evaluation of cell-based compound screens. the experimental setup can be configured in any order and re-used for multiple subsequent analyses. a standardized validation is included in the tool and can be used to assess the accuracy of the experiments. the approach is suitable to confirm biological activity of

158," the gram-negative bacterium y. pseudotuberculosis is a human enteropathogen which is able to cross the intestinal mucosa through the m cells in peyer's patches and thus infect the underlying tissues. however, in elderly or debilitated individuals, the organism frequently gains access to the bloodstream and can cause an often fatal septicemia. known y. pseudotuberculosis virulence genes are transcriptionally regulated by temperature – most probably in order to adapt to the bacterium's life cycle outside and inside the host. regulation by the omnipresent thermal stimulus can be modulated by signals such as ph, other ion concentrations and nutrient availability. this allows bacterial pathogens to adapt their gene transcription profiles in response to environmental cues sensed during the course of infection and express the most appropriate virulence factors at the expense of useless ones. to date, the transcriptional gene regulation occurring when y. pseudotuberculosis enters the human bloodstream has only been inferred indirectly from in vivo results in rodent models of infection and in vitro gene transcription studies. the in vitro regulation of certain yersinia virulence loci has mainly been analyzed with respect to single growth parameter changes mimicking the environmental signals known to be detected by bacteria in blood, such as iron scarcity, oxygen tension and ph. in the present work, we have adopted an intermediate approach by comparing the overall gene expression profiles of y. pseudotuberculosis grown in human plasma and in luria-bertani broth. we then compared the observed variations with those recently published for y. pestis, an almost genetically identical pathogen which, however, causes plague – one of the most severe systemic infections in humans and other mammals.  the genome of y. pseudotuberculosis strain ip has been recently deciphered: it contains coding sequences, of which are borne by the virulence-associated plasmid pyv and are carried by a 27-kb cryptic plasmid. only around 49% of cdss encode a product with a putative or proven function. to gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of virulence and metabolism genes that takes place when y. pseudotuberculosis enters and multiplies in the bloodstream, we compared the transcriptome of ip grown in human plasma to the one of the same strain grown in luria-bertani. to this end, we prepared macroarrays composed of pcr fragments of ≈ 400-base pairs, covering 96% of ip32953's cdss and used them as described elsewhere and in the methods section. briefly, in three independent cultures, total rna was extracted from ip cells grown in lb broth or human plasma, in the exponential or stationary phase and at 28°c or 37°c. macroarray probing was performed three times with independently retrotranscribed and 33p-radiolabeled rna samples from each of the eight growth combinations. after macroarray imaging, hybridization intensity data were log-transformed and normalized using a simple median normalization method. relative data have been deposited in the genoscript database in accordance with standards of the microarray gene expression data society. an analysis of variance was carried out independently for each gene, with the three biological factors of variation as fixed effects. this statistical approach allowed us to evaluate the transcriptional variations induced by each factor for the dataset as a whole. thus, three ratios and associated p-values were calculated for each gene. inter-condition transcriptional differences were considered to be statistically significant if the p-value was below. representative macroarray hybridization results were confirmed by qrt-pcr on stored rna samples, using the constitutively expressed yptb gene as a reference. since the physiological status of the bacterium during host infection is unknown, we focused our analysis on genes regulated by the temperature and/or the medium in both the exponential and stationary phases. all y. pseudotuberculosis transcriptional variations discussed herein were compared with those of their respective y. pestis orthologs and are summarized in table y. pseudotuberculosis ip genes regulated at the transcriptional level by growth temperature and/or medium are listed in tables and free iron limitation is a well-known stimulus encountered by bacteria in plasma. as expected, ip genes required for iron storage ) were found to be downregulated in plasma. transcriptional upregulation of most iron uptake systems is also consistent with this condition and is in agreement with the recent findings in y. pestis. as iron is used as a cofactor by numerous enzymes, the metal is essential for a broad range of metabolic processes. besides activation of iron homeostasis systems, lack of iron is also expected to be associated with a dramatic decrease in the transcription of genes encoding such enzymes, with the underlying goal of lowering iron consumption. this situation is exemplified by the kata gene that encodes catalase, whose transcription is decreased in both y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis during growth in plasma. however, the increase in transcription of the bio locus and observed in both species) suggests that differential genetic control of a subset of iron-dependent enzymes may favor supply of this metal to the pathways that are most important for bacterial survival. furthermore, the impact of transcriptional downregulation on reorientation of metabolic fluxes may be minimized by the concomitant activation of genes coding for isoenzymes that are better suited to this situation. one example is that of the manganese- and iron-dependent superoxide dismutase genes, which are fur-activated and -repressed, respectively in both y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis. similarly, the class ib ribonucleotide reductase -encoding genes are probably important for bacterial life in plasma, since they were found to be upregulated at the expense of those in classes iii and ia – even though all three classes are equally involved in generating the synthetic precursors for dna. the fact that only the first class is fur-activated is consistent with this observation. similar variations have also been recorded in y. pestis. however, whereas purine/pyrimidine metabolism has been shown to be essential for y. pestis virulence, the role of this metabolic pathway in the physiopathology of y. pseudotuberculosis has not yet been investigated. along with class 1b rnrs, more than half of the enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are known to be catalytically iron-dependent and/or believed to be transcriptionally activated by fur. accordingly, and in line with transcriptome data from y. pestis, we observed that transcription of these genes fell significantly when y. pseudotuberculosis was grown in plasma. in contrast to the low availability of iron in blood, glucose is readily available in this biological fluid and at a higher concentration than in lb broth. when y. pseudotuberculosis was cultured in plasma, genes involved in glycolysis and the upstream, sugar-supplying, phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent systems were found to be upregulated, as depicted in fig. this finding is reminiscent of an aerobic phenomenon referred to as ""glucose overflow metabolism""; this consists in channeling the carbon flow towards acetate formation instead of citrate formation, in order to prevent the excessive accumulation of nadh that would otherwise result from very high glucose consumption rates. however, one main feature of glucose overflow in e. coli is acetate accumulation due to a strong transcriptional repression of the glyoxylate shunt acebak operon. interestingly, at least the first two of these genes are not down- but are up-regulated in y. pseudotuberculosis, suggesting a need for this species to limit acetate overloads. the continuous de-repression of these genes suggests that this might also be the case in y. pestis. these pathways are controlled by complex and finely balanced networks involving numerous pleiotropic regulators, including fur, crp, fnr and arca. this unexpected upregulation may well result from the combination of both high glucose and low iron levels in plasma. whether this occurs through the strong transcriptional repression observed with both fnr and arca remains to be addressed in future experiments. temperature upshift is typically considered to be the main signal indicating to bacteria that they have entered the host; this hypothesis is supported by the thermal dependency of almost all y. pseudotuberculosis virulence genes and also many of the latter's regulators. several of these genes were also found to be influenced by growth in plasma and the changes were sometimes in the opposite direction to those seen with temperature upshifts: whereas expression of the invasin-encoding gene inv was significantly repressed during bacterial growth under both conditions, transcription of psaa was promoted by temperature upshifts, but was one of the most strongly repressed in plasma. interestingly, the impact of this medium on psaa transcription was not considered to be significant in y. pestis and suggests that the ph antigen does not have the same importance in blood dissemination in the two species. in contrast to the latter two adhesins, transcriptional activation of yada was found to be the highest of all the y. pseudotuberculosis genes induced under plasma growth conditions. this observation is consistent with yada's involvement in microbial resistance to complement. similarly, ompc whose product is believed to be targeted by lactoferricin, a bactericidal peptide derived from lactoferrin by enzymatic cleavage, is strongly repressed, whilst no significant modification was observed for the outer membrane-encoding genes ompa and ompc lastly, an essential determinant of bacterial virulence is the plasmid-encoded type iii secretion system which performs intracellular delivery of a set of yersinia outer proteins that subvert the host's defenses. interestingly, y. pseudotuberculosis growth in plasma induced the upregulation of genes required for secretion, translocation and chaperoning of the yop effector proteins in a similar fashion to that observed upon temperature upshift. furthermore, the apparently coordinated regulation of yada and the ttss-encoding genes by temperature and growth in plasma suggests the involvement of a common means of genetic control. ymoa protein which is very similar in structure and function to the haemolysin expression modulating protein hha from escherichia coli) was shown to negatively influence yada and yop expression by favoring supercoiling of the pyv plasmid. a two-fold reduction in ymoa transcription in plasma may be enough to contribute to the ttss upregulation recorded in y. pseudotuberculosis. strikingly, this plasma-induced ttss activation was not observed in y. pestis, since only out of the genes mentioned above were found to be upregulated; this raises the possibility that these two pathogenic yersinia species may differ in their transcriptional regulation of pyv-harbored virulence genes.  overall transcription profiling of y. pseudotuberculosis grown in an environment mimicking the blood stage of the infectious process revealed gene regulations that could not be anticipated from the results of previously reported single-stimulus studies. our findings thus provide insight into how a number of simultaneously sensed environmental cues may be taken into account by the bacterium in a hierarchical manner. furthermore, comparison of our analyses with those previously performed in y. pestis suggests that transcription of common critical virulence factors may be differently influenced by the plasma environment in these two species. "," in man, infection by the gram-negative enteropathogen yersinia pseudotuberculosis is usually limited to the terminal ileum. however, in immunocompromised patients, the microorganism may disseminate from the digestive tract and thus cause a systemic infection with septicemia.  to gain insight into the metabolic pathways and virulence factors expressed by the bacterium at the blood stage of pseudotuberculosis, we compared the overall gene transcription patterns of bacterial cells cultured in either human plasma or luria-bertani medium. the most marked plasma-triggered metabolic consequence in y. pseudotuberculosis was the switch to high glucose consumption, which is reminiscent of the acetogenic pathway in escherichia coli. however, upregulation of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes suggests that acetate may be further metabolized in y. pseudotuberculosis. our data also indicate that the bloodstream environment can regulate major virulence genes; the yada adhesin gene and most of the transcriptional units of the pyv-encoded type iii secretion apparatus were found to be upregulated, whereas transcription of the ph antigen locus was strongly repressed.  our results suggest that plasma growth of y. pseudotuberculosis is responsible for major transcriptional regulatory events and prompts key metabolic reorientations within the bacterium, which may in turn have an impact on virulence.

159," the mosquito anopheles gambiae is the main malaria vector in sub-saharan africa. resistance to anti-malaria drugs and insecticides together with the lack of vaccines highlight the need for novel strategies in malaria control. such a strategy could be the interruption of the transmission cycle within the mosquito. the mosquito becomes infected with the malaria parasite by taking a blood meal. the blood meal itself brings metabolic changes and induces a state of oxidative stress. this is further increased by the presence of plasmodium parasites in the blood meal. during mosquito response to infection, active nitrogen and oxygen radicals are produced to contain plasmodium infection. these products may represent potential oxidative stress that can be ameliorated or eliminated by detoxification enzymes. for example several glutathione s-transferases have peroxidase activity and some can also metabolise reactive α,β-aldehydes. gst expression can also be induced by reactive oxygen species. while gsts help to eliminate ros, cytochrome p monooxygenases may actually contribute towards its generation. although transcription alteration of detoxification genes in response to bacteria and plasmodium has been described, the nature of this response hasn't been fully discussed. in this study we describe the impact of p. berghei infection at two time points on the expression of detoxification genes in the midgut and fat body. we identified several genes, previously implicated in the detoxification of xenobiotics, which are differentially expressed in relation to parasite infection in the midgut and fat body. the possible role of detoxification enzymes in modulating malaria transmission is discussed.  microarray tissues for microarray analyses were collected at two critical time points of the plasmodium cycle in the mosquito host: day following the blood meal, during which parasites invade the midgut epithelium, and days after the blood meal when sporozoites are starting to be released to the hemolymph, as demonstrated by detection of parasite's dna in the hemolymph. the mosquitoes were fed on mice that were either infected with the parasite or uninfected. the success of infection was indirectly confirmed by randomly selecting up to 19- mosquitoes that were screened for the presence of oocysts. most of the mosquitoes were found to be positive and hence it can be assumed that the tissues used in the gene expression studies were infected too. the microarray experiment was developed to answer the following questions, regarding midgut and fat body tissues: which genes respond to plasmodium midgut epithelium invasion which genes respond to the release of sporozoites into the hemolymph, and which genes respond differently between the two events. in the microarray analysis loci were differentially expressed in at least one of the comparisons made. the results for all comparisons are given in table s. the microarray results were validated by comparing the mean values for the expression data for genes from three independent replicates obtained by microarray analysis with the corresponding mean expression values obtained with the multiplex quantitative rt-pcr. the pearson correlation coefficient demonstrates a high degree of correlation between the two methods. genes differentially expressed in infected versus uninfected mosquitoes at day post blood meal at day post blood meal more changes were observed in the midgut as compared to the fat body. while in the midgut genes were differentially expressed, only were different in the fat body. in the midgut, cyps were differentially expressed with the majority being down-regulated. in the fat body, five out of the six cyps differentially expressed in response to plasmodium infection were up-regulated. the vast majority of these differentially expressed cyps belong to families primarily associated with detoxification roles rather than families implicated in hormone biosynthetic pathways. similarly in the gst family the two classes primarily associated with xenobiotic detoxification, delta and epsilon, were generally repressed in response to parasite infection with the notable exception of gstd which was strongly up-regulated in infected vs. uninfected midguts. in both a. gambiae and a. stephensi, plasmodium parasite invasion induces an increase of nitric oxide synthase expression and in turn an increase in nitric oxide and no metabolites. no has been shown to down regulate cyp gene expression in other organisms. we hypothesize therefore that the observed down-regulation of cyps in the midgut may also be linked to increased levels of no. of the up-regulated cyps, cyp6m showed the greatest response to infection. this gene has already been reported to be over-expressed in response to p. berghei infection and implicated in resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. one possible explanation for this up-regulation is a response to an endogenous mediator increased upon the infection process. as an example, prostaglandins have been shown to induce expression of cyps in human liver cells. superoxide dismutases constitute part of the first line of defence against ros and reactive nitrogen oxide species. however, sod was down-regulated day post infection suggesting that down-regulation of oxidative stress response genes could be part of the defence response triggered by parasite invasion. a similar mechanism has been described for other oxidative stress response genes such as catalase in response to plasmodium invasion. cytoskeleton reorganization and up-regulation of genes related to folding and movement of microtubules suggest that cytoskeleton dynamics and remodelling function as key elements of plasmodium invasion of the anopheles midgut. this epithelium rearrangement is a robust molecular response to ookinetes penetration. in a whole genome microarray study seven tubulins were differentially up-regulated during the invasion period. here too, three cytoskeletal genes represented on the detox array, tubulin b, tubulin a and actin, were up-regulated at day post infection. in mammals, microtubule disruption leads to down-regulation of several cyps and perhaps similar responses also lead to down-regulation of cyps during parasite invasion. genes differentially expressed in infected versus uninfected mosquitoes days post blood meal at this time point, when sporozoites are released from oocysts to the hemocoel a less pronounced effect on the transcript levels of detoxification genes was observed as compared to midgut invasion. two of the genes up-regulated on day cyp4h and cyp4h were down-regulated at day, suggesting that their suppression is linked to the invasion of the midgut epithelium by the parasite, while their up-regulation on day may be associated with subtle changes in midgut structure as sporozoites are leaving oocysts. gst was up-regulated at both time points which indicates that this enzyme is directly involved in the response to parasites at both stages. although at this stage the fat body would have had direct contact with parasites or at least molecules released by parasites during midgut egress, the transcriptional response in the fat body was more pronounced at day than on day post infection. cyp6m was down-regulated on day but was up-regulated at day, indicating that this cyp responds to particular events of the parasites life cycle. genes that show a different response between plasmodium midgut epithelium invasion and release of sporozoites into the hemolymph the interaction term between the two time points was investigated to compare responses to plasmodium invasion of the midgut epithelium and to the release of sporozoites into the hemolymph. heat diagrams with the genes that presented significant positive and negative interaction in midgut and fat body are shown in figure the number of genes under positive interaction was higher in the midgut while the opposite was seen in the fat body, reflecting the active site of infection. abc transporters from family c showed a strong negative interaction in the midgut and to a lesser extent in the fat body, implying that these cytoplasmic membrane transporters are important for infection control probably by transporting glutathione conjugates or lipid-derived eicosanoids that are known to be involved in insect response to infection. the interaction analysis confirmed that there is a considerable difference between the gene expression levels between day and day in response to plasmodium infection. there were a high number of genes that had different levels of expression in response to the ookinetes invasion of the midgut and in response to the release of sporozoites in the hemolymph, showing that these genes have the ability of changing their expression levels according with the time of infection. in the midgut, the majority of differentially expressed genes between day and day were the same both in uninfected and infected mosquitoes, as was the direction of change, indicating that these genes were responding mainly to the blood meal, as it represents a strong oxidative insult. however, this total concordance was not observed in the fat body where only 26% of genes were regulated in the same direction between infected and uninfected while 38% were regulated in opposite directions. the trend of expression of both tissues suggests that differences observed are due to fat body response to parasite released from the oocysts into the hemocoel. the mosquito response to sporozoites in the hemolymph triggers effector mechanisms like melanization, and a burst of expression of genes encoding constituents of the immune system including the production of free radicals that needs a counter detoxification reaction. after excluding genes similarly regulated in both infected and uninfected groups, fat body cyp genes were down-regulated, at day as observed for the midgut at day sod was down-regulated and seems to be determinant for parasite control. tpx was up-regulated confirming its role on infection detoxification mediated by the fat body. the fat body has an important role in the detoxification and in the immune response of the mosquito on day of infection when compared with day post infection, which is not observed when we compare infected and uninfected mosquitoes on day  this study determined transcription profiles of detoxification enzymes during plasmodium infection in a. gambiae, showing important changes in the expression of several detoxification enzymes, as well as membrane associated abc transporters. interestingly, genes coding for detoxification enzymes revealed a variable response, being differentially induced or repressed depending on the tissue and stage of infection. although the mechanism underlying these changes is presently unclear, this differential regulation of detoxification genes observed during plasmodium infection may be due to 1) the increasing oxidative stress caused by the presence of the parasite; 2) the epithelium rearrangement involving alterations in cytoskeleton genes caused by the ookinetes invasion and the oocysts burst; or 3) a combination of both. a hypothetical scenario for the inter-relationship between infection and detoxifying molecules is depicted in figure in contrast to the majority of differentially expressed p450s which were down-regulated in response to midgut invasion, cyp6m expression was induced in response to p. berghei infection. this cyp is involved in resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. this observation together with regulation of other genes, such as membrane abc transporters involved in xenobiotic elimination, lead us to speculate that there might be an association between the response to plasmodium infection and insecticide resistance, enhancing the importance of further studying their interaction. "," anopheles gambiae has been shown to change its global gene expression patterns upon plasmodium infection. while many alterations are directly related to the mosquito's innate immune response, parasite invasion is also expected to generate toxic by-products such as free radicals. the current study aimed at identifying which loci coding for detoxification enzymes are differentially expressed as a function of plasmodium berghei infection in midgut and fat body tissues.  using a custom-made dna microarray, transcript levels of loci primarily belonging to three major detoxification enzyme families were compared in infected and uninfected mosquitoes both during ookinete invasion and the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel. the greatest changes in gene expression were observed in the midgut in response to ookinete invasion. interestingly, many detoxification genes including a large number of p450s were down-regulated at this stage. in the fat body, while less dramatic, gene expression alterations were also observed and occurred during the ookinete invasion and during the release of sporozoites into the hemocoel. while most gene expression changes were tissue-related, cyp6m a cyp previously associated with insecticide resistance, was over-expressed both in the midgut and fat body during ookinete invasion.  most toxicity-related reactions occur in the midgut shortly after the ingestion of an infected blood meal. strong up-regulation of cyp6m in the midgut and the fat body as well as its previous association with insecticide resistance shows its broad role in metabolic detoxification.

160," the estimation of evolutionary distances between gene/protein sequences is one of the most important problems in molecular evolution. in particular, it lies at the heart of most phylogenetic tree construction methods. the estimation of such distances is a two step process: first, homologous characters are identified, then the distances are estimated from the character substitution patterns. the most accurate matching of homologous characters is obtained by multiple sequence alignments. indeed, by considering all sequences simultaneously, msas yield a consistent and in principle optimal grouping of the homologous characters. unfortunately, msas are hard to compute optimally, and thus are in practice computed using heuristics. alternatively, the sequences can be analyzed exclusively on the basis of pairs of sequences, using an algorithm such as smith-waterman that yields optimal pairwise alignments. this approach is often taken by large-scale comparative genomics analysis such as mips, oma or roundup, which analyze the sequences pairwise due to computational constraints. once the homologous characters are identified, the second step of distance estimation can proceed. the method of choice is a maximum likelihood estimation based on some model of evolution. there too, the distances can either be estimated simultaneously from all sequences using a combination of tree topology inference and joint optimization of all branches, or pairwise, by estimating the distances between every pair of sequences. joint estimation requires msas, while pairwise distance estimation can be done from either opas or from the pairwise alignments induced by an msa. fig. provides an overview of the different approaches. in all cases, the estimation of evolutionary distances is subject to inference uncertainty, which is commonly quantified by their variances and covariances. indeed, the distance variance information can be used to build confidence intervals around the estimate; covariances of pairs of distances can be used to build the confidence intervals of combinations of distances. examples of applications include generalized least squares phylogenetic tree building construction of confidence sets of trees, test for monophyly using likelihood ratios, comparison of evolutionary distances for orthology inference, or distance-based lateral gene transfer detection variance estimates are provided by ml theory in both joint and pairwise distances estimation. however, ml theory only provides covariance estimates if all distances are estimated jointly. covariance estimates for distances computed from ipas in the context of specific parametric substitution models have been reported by hasegawa et al. and bulmer, and were generalized by susko to all markovian models of evolution. furthermore, the covariance of distances from ipas can also be estimated through bootstrapping. as for the covariance of distances obtained from opas, the main difficulty in computing them is that, since sequence pairs are aligned individually, they usually have inconsistencies in their inference of the homologous characters. thus, the alignments cannot be partitioned in consistent ""columns"" of characters, and neither susko's method nor resampling approaches such as bootstrapping can be applied. indeed, in the case of analyses relying exclusively on pairwise comparison and distance estimation, i.e. where no msa computation can be afforded, we are not aware of any previously published estimator for the covariance of distances estimates from pairwise alignments. we have shown in a previous article a numerical approximation for the constrained case of the covariance of two opa distances involving a common sequence, for empirical substitution models such as pam or jtt. in this article, we present an estimator for the covariance of ml distances estimated from opas that works on triplets and quartets of sequences. this solves the problem of sets of sequences of arbitrary size, because each covariance involves at most four sequences at a time. thus, the full covariance matrix is naturally obtained through quartet analysis. we analyze the performances of the estimator in terms of bias and variance. finally, we compare the results obtained on triplets of sequences to our previous work.  in the following, we present and analyze the performances of the estimator for the covariance of two distances. for this purpose, it is informative to analyze the results separately for the following three different underlying topological relations, illustrated in fig. 2: case of dependence the two distances are estimated between four distinct sequences, and they have some evolution in common. with such an evolutionary history, the two distances estimates covary positively. case of independence the two distances are estimated between four distinct sequences, but they have no evolution in common. this case is informative, because a central assumption in most evolutionary models is that evolution on different branches is independent. with no branch in common, the distances should not covary. thus, such a topology can be used to test the estimators as negative control. case of triplet the two distances involve a common sequence, and have some evolution in common. this case is of special interest, because we have previously presented an alternate estimator for this particular case using a different approach. thus, we can compare our results to this approach, hereafter called ""the numerical approximation"". note that the covariances are estimated using the same algorithm in all three cases: we only distinguish them from each another for the purpose of this analysis. to assess the performance of the covariance estimator, it was compared against the monte carlo covariance estimator. in short, each point shown in the figures was obtained from sets of sequences mutated along a random quartet subtree of the tree of life. that way, the evaluation is based on tree samples that are distributed as closely as possible to real biological data. to account for gene families with varying rates, each quartet was scaled with a random factor uniformly distributed between and note that results corresponding to very large distance constitute extreme cases; for instance, when sequences are pam units apart, each position has, on average, mutated times. fig. 3a shows the mean of our estimator versus the monte carlo estimator in nine scatterplots arising from combining the topologies mentioned above with three different sequence lengths. in the case of dependence, the first row, we see that our estimator lies in about 80% of the cases within the 95% confidence interval of the monte carlo estimator. in the case of independence, both estimators are close to zero, though our estimator shows a minor upward bias in some cases. the third row gives the result of both the covariance estimator introduced here, as well as the numerical approximation from our previous study. here, we see that though the former performs well in cases of lower covariance values, it shows a clear downward bias in cases of larger covariances. the numerical approximation does not present any apparent sign of bias, which is hardly surprising, given that it was obtained through regression. what is however surprising, is that, given its simple structure, it performs better than the covariance estimator, which takes into account more data and is backed by a more detailed model. it is instructive to compare the absolute bias of the covariance estimator to the well-known ml variance estimator. as can be seen in fig. 3b, the ml variance is also biased for high variance values. we conjecture that this is mainly due to mis-aligned positions, which cause model violations in the parameter estimation. this problem is also likely to affect the covariance estimator. even more directly, the ml variance estimator is a factor in the expression of the covariance estimator, so any error in the ml variance is propagated to the covariance estimator. at this point, improving the ml estimator for cases of high divergence is likely to require better alignments, or an explicit modeling of the mis-aligned positions, which is beyond the scope of the present work. further, to put the bias of the covariance estimator into perspective, we compared it to the standard deviation of the estimator. fig. presents the bias and standard deviation as function of the average number of anchors for sequence length of the anchors are the positions that are consistently aligned in the opas involved. both bias and standard deviation strongly depend on the fraction of anchors, which can be thought of as a measure of alignment quality. fig. depicts the dependency between percentage of anchors and average distance. as one would expect, the fraction of anchors decreases as divergence increases. for a fraction of anchor positions below 60%, the average of the two distances involved in the covariance computation is always greater than pam. in fig. we first consider the bias and standard deviation for the case of dependence. when the fraction of anchor positions is above 60%, the bias is far smaller than the standard deviation, and is therefore likely to have little negative impact in practice. in the case of triplets, the bias exceeds the standard deviation already when the fraction of anchors is about 80%. the ml variance estimator has this transition around 75% of anchors. in the case of independence, where we expect our covariance estimator to be zero, its bias is always much smaller than its standard deviation. most applications of the covariance estimator involve the covariance matrix. let a^ be an approximation to the matrix a. we refer to ||aˆ−a||2||a|| as the relative error in a^, where ||·|| denotes the two-norm. fig. shows the relative error of the × variance-covariance matrices computed with the ml variance estimator in the diagonal entries and our covariance estimator in the off-diagonal entries, and the same × matrices with only diagonal entries. the plots show that for the dependence case the the matrices with both covariance and ml variance estimators have a equal or lower relative error than the matrices with the ml variance only, except for a few cases in the region with a high fraction of anchors. in the triplet case, the variance-covariance matrices have always lower error then variance matrices. finally, in the case of independence, the matrices with covariance do not always have lower relative error, but this is expected, because the true covariance is null in this special case.  we have presented a method to estimate the covariances of distances estimated from pairwise alignments. it does not require the construction of msas, which are hard to compute and therefore are only approximated in practice. furthermore, it does not rely on phylogenetic trees as it is the case with covariance estimation from joint ml, or in covariance estimation methods that model the covariances as a function of shared branch lengths. tree building is not only a costly process, but is also subject to inference errors. the accuracy of our estimator is comparable to the ml variance estimator. both estimators are biased but in both cases the bias is, for distances below pam, far smaller than their standard deviation. the bias of the covariance estimator becomes worse with declining percentage of anchors. these biases arise because the alignment positions under scrutiny do not constitute an unbiased subsample of the true homologous positions. note that misaligned positions are likely to affect distances from msas too. a solution to this problem would lead to better distance estimates in the first place. in the meanwhile, it is probably best to issue a warning if the percentage of anchors falls below some threshold. the estimation of evolutionary distances is a very important process in molecular evolution, and therefore the covariance estimator presented here will be of use for various applications, such as the construction of gls trees on opa distances, the construction of confidence sets of trees based on the gls test statistic, relative-rate tests, distance-based lateral gene transfer detection, and in general in any process that needs to estimate confidence of distance combinations. "," the estimation of a distance between two biological sequences is a fundamental process in molecular evolution. it is usually performed by maximum likelihood on characters aligned either pairwise or jointly in a multiple sequence alignment. estimators for the covariance of pairs from an msa are known, but we are not aware of any solution for cases of pairs aligned independently. in large-scale analyses, it may be too costly to compute msas every time distances must be compared, and therefore a covariance estimator for distances estimated from pairs aligned independently is desirable. knowledge of covariances improves any process that compares or combines distances, such as in generalized least-squares phylogenetic tree building, orthology inference, or lateral gene transfer detection.  in this paper, we introduce an estimator for the covariance of distances from sequences aligned pairwise. its performance is analyzed through extensive monte carlo simulations, and compared to the well-known variance estimator of ml distances. our covariance estimator can be used together with the ml variance estimator to form covariance matrices.  the estimator performs similarly to the ml variance estimator. in particular, it shows no sign of bias when sequence divergence is below pam units. above that distance, the covariances tend to be underestimated, but then ml variances are also underestimated.

161," compelling evidence suggest that long-term changes in different brain areas and circuits mediating cognitive and emotional behaviors represent the biological underpinnings of mood and anxiety disorders. since the vast majority of neurons and synapses in these areas use glutamate as neurotransmitter, the glutamatergic system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of different psychiatric disorders and, potentially, appears to be a final common pathway for the therapeutic action of antidepressant agents. a number of studies have shown that traditional antidepressants regulate ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors and modulate glutamate release and transmission in relevant limbic and cortical areas. in this context, several lines of preclinical/clinical research, which have investigated the action of molecules that directly target the glutamate synapse, are opening the way for glutamatergic, rapid acting, novel antidepressants. we have previously found that chronic treatment with different antidepressants significantly reduced depolarization-evoked glutamate release from hippocampal synaptic terminals. the above effect was accounted for by changes in protein phosphorylation, in turn affecting protein/protein interactions that regulate the assembly of the presynaptic soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor complex, mediating fusion of synaptic vesicles with presynaptic membrane. we have also shown that acute footshock-stress induces a marked increase of depolarization-evoked overflow of glutamate from prefrontal and frontal cortex synaptosomes, via glucocorticoid receptor activation and snare complex accumulation in synaptic membranes. chronic fluoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine or agomelatine completely prevented the increase of glutamate release induced by stress. agomelatine is a new antidepressant, synergically acting as an agonist of mt1/mt receptors and as an antagonist of 5-ht2c receptors. although the effects of agomelatine on glutamate release in prefrontal and frontal cortex have been investigated, no data are available on the effects of this drug in hippocampus. thus, aims of the present work were: to assess whether chronic treatment with agomelatine modulates glutamate release from superfused hippocampal synaptosomes. to study whether agomelatine reduces the accumulation of the presynaptic snare complex in hippocampus.  chronic treatment with agomelatine or venlafaxine reduces depolarization-evoked release of glutamate from hippocampal synaptosomes synaptosomes were purified from the hippocampus of chronically drug- or vehicle-treated rats, and exposed in superfusion to kcl or ionomycin to assess glutamate and γ-amminobutyric acid release. as shown in figure 1a, chronic treatment for weeks with either agomelatine or venlafaxine modified the depolarization-evoked overflow of glutamate. indeed, both agomelatine and venlafaxine significantly reduced the mm kcl-induced glutamate overflow. interestingly, the release of glutamate induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which mobilizes vesicles from both the recycling and reserve pools, was unaffected by drug treatments, suggesting that the action of the drugs is mainly confined to vesicles docked to the presynaptic membrane and primed for release. moreover, as previously observed both in hippocampus and prefrontal/frontal cortex, the mm kcl-induced overflow of gaba was not modified by venlafaxine or agomelatine. chronic antidepressant treatments reduce snare complex in hippocampal presynaptic membranes the core of the presynaptic snare complex is formed by the coiled-coil domain interaction of two membrane proteins and one vesicle protein. a large body of evidence demonstrated that the snare complex mediates the fusion of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release. because in hippocampus glutamate synaptic terminals represent the vast majority of total synapses, molecular changes in the presynaptic release apparatus can be likely correlated with changes in glutamate release. thus, we evaluated if the decrease of glutamate release induced by agomelatine and venlafaxine was associated with altered assembling of presynaptic snare complexes. the analysis of snare complexes in purified presynaptic membranes revealed two major syntaxin-1-containing complexes, migrating at ~ kda and ~ kda, as previously reported. no significant changes were found in total syntaxin- levels. in line with the reduction of depolarization-dependent glutamate release, chronic treatment with both venlafaxine and agomelatine significantly reduced the accumulation of kda snare complex in synaptic membranes. no significant changes were found in kda snare complex accumulation. overall, the present findings show that chronic administration of agomelatine or the reference antidepressant venlafaxine significantly reduced the endogenous release of glutamate from hippocampal synaptosomes, as previously found with other traditional antidepressants. at the same time, both drugs decreased the accumulation of snare complexes in presynaptic membranes. discussion and  this work demonstrates that chronic treatment with the new antidepressant agomelatine, a mt and mt receptor agonist and 5-ht2c receptor antagonist, as well as with venlafaxine, a selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, markedly reduces depolarization-evoked endogenous release of glutamate from hippocampal synaptosomes. interestingly, the depolarization-evoked release of gaba was not modified, suggesting that both drugs selectively inhibit glutamatergic release without affecting gaba transmission. these results are in line with previous studies, both in vivo and ex vivo, showing similar effects on glutamatergic transmission of a number of traditional antidepressants and of agomelatine. the reduction of glutamate release with no changes in gaba release suggests an alteration in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that could improve the signal to noise ratio in glutamate transmission, when it becomes compromised by excessive release. in this regard, we have demonstrated that chronic treatment with different classes of antidepressants, includ-ing agomelatine, was able to completely prevent the marked increase of depolarization-evoked glutamate release from prefrontal and frontal cortex synaptosomes induced by acute stress. another intriguing result of this study is that, despite chronic agomelatine inhibited glutamate release evoked by mm kcl depolarization, it had no effect on release induced by mm ionomycin. indeed, if it is generally agreed that electrical/chemical depolarization mainly induces the fusion of vesicles of the readily releasable pool, ionomycin also promotes calcium-dependent fusion of vesicles, but mainly from the reserve pool. therefore, our results suggest that agomelatine may selectively affect the rrp of vesicles, thereby altering a physiologically relevant pool for neurotransmitter release. in line with this hypothesis, we found that the reduction of glutamate release induced by chronic agomelatine and venlafaxine was accompanied by reduced accumulation of snare complexes in synaptic membranes. these data are in line with our previous results showing that traditional antidepressant-induced reduction of glutamate release is accounted for by changes in protein-protein interactions regulating the assembly of the snare complex, and by reduction of complex accumulation in presynaptic membranes. however, contrary to previous results with traditional antidepressants, here we did not find major changes in the expression of syntaxin- after weeks of treatment with agomelatine or venlafaxine. because the same result was obtained with both drugs, we suggest that the difference from other antidepressants is probably due to the different timing of drug-treatment. however, the main finding is that, after treatment for weeks, agomelatine and venlafaxine still reduced both the accumulation of snare complexes at the level of the rrp and the physiological release of glutamate. indeed, the snare complex and associated proteins play a critical role in vesicle docking, priming, fusion and synchronization of neurotransmitter release at presynaptic membranes and it was established that the snare complex corresponds to the minimal machinery for membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells, forming a stable complex that make the vesicles competent for fusion. therefore, a reduction of snare complex accumulation in synaptic membranes is consistent with reduced neurotransmitter release. in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that chronic agomelatine dampens hippocampal glutamate neurotransmission, a likely component of the therapeutic action of antidepressants. the intriguing finding of reduced accumulation of snare complexes in presynaptic membranes suggests selected mechanisms in the exocytotic machinery as possible molecular targets of these drugs. "," growing compelling evidence from clinical and preclinical studies has demonstrated the primary role of alterations of glutamatergic transmission in cortical and limbic areas in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. chronic antidepressants have been shown to dampen endogenous glutamate release from rat hippocampal synaptic terminals and to prevent the marked increase of glutamate overflow induced by acute behavioral stress in frontal/prefrontal cortex. agomelatine, a new antidepressant endowed with mt1/mt agonist and 5-ht2c serotonergic antagonist properties, has shown efficacy at both preclinical and clinical levels.  chronic treatment with agomelatine, or with the reference drug venlafaxine, induced a marked decrease of depolarization-evoked endogenous glutamate release from purified hippocampal synaptic terminals in superfusion. no changes were observed in gaba release. this effect was accompanied by reduced accumulation of snare protein complexes, the key molecular effector of vesicle docking, priming and fusion at presynaptic membranes.  our data suggest that the novel antidepressant agomelatine share with other classes of antidepressants the ability to modulate glutamatergic transmission in hippocampus. its action seems to be mediated by molecular mechanisms located on the presynaptic membrane and related with the size of the vesicle pool ready for release. antidepressantagomelatinevenlafaxineglutamatesynaptosomeshippocampus ",34fc0373-e4ca-40ce-874b-89c72009cd99,pubmed
162," massively parallel sequencing technology can be used to efficiently interrogate multiple targeted genomic regions for clinically relevant mutations. the use of short unique sequence indexes, or barcodes, increases sequencing throughput and allows analysis of multiple samples in a single sequencing run. application of this technology will allow cost-efficient screening of genes known or suspected to harbor clinically relevant pathogenic mutations. while small mutations are readily detectable with current analysis platforms, methods for the identification of copy-number variants are not well established for targeted data. the ability to detect the full spectrum of mutations is critical to the success of targeted sequencing projects. current methods for detecting structural variation from massively parallel data use either paired-end mapping or depth of coverage methods. paired-end mapping methods perform well for mate-pair sequence data and have the advantage of identifying both balanced and unbalanced structural variation. comprehensive cnv scanning using paired-end mapping requires mulitple insert sizes and the presence of paired tags that bridge the breakpoint of the event. this approach is widely used in the assembly of whole genomes but cannot be applied to targeted enrichment protocols, as hybridization-based capture methods for massively parallel sequencing typically require small insert fragments and breakpoints of structural variants may lie outside of targeted regions. depth of coverage methods do not require breakpoint capture or have specific size restrictions, yet such methods are hampered by low signal to noise ratio due to sparse sampling and sampling bias based on sequence gc-content, bait coverage, and other factors affecting capture efficiency. further, depth of coverage methods require cross-sample normalization and comparison in order to deal with variation in coverage across genomic regions and samples. we previously showed that a basic depth of coverage approach performs well to identify cnvs from high-coverage targeted sequence data. depth of coverage methods have achieved higher signal to noise by averaging data across a genomic region, however, doing so results in a loss of the ability to detect smaller mutations. in addition, depth of coverage methods are poor at localizing breakpoints. here we describe a method that combines cnv detection through high-resolution depth of coverage analysis with call confirmation through partially-mapped reads. this allows for the identification of dna gain or loss even where breakpoints are outside the targeted regions, and exact breakpoint characterization where breakpoints are within the targeted regions. by combining these orthologous approaches, cnvs of any size can be identified from targeted high-throughput sequence data with a low false-positive rate.  our method uses two independent approaches, depth of coverage and a scan for partially-mapped reads at cnv edges. we implemented a straightforward depth of coverage algorithm and internally validated cnv calls by looking for a signature of partially-mapped reads that confirm the cnv breakpoints where possible. partially-mapped reads are defined as high-quality full length reads where the best alignment to targeted regions is a perfect match less than bases in length. a minimum match length of bp was used for this analysis. where partially-mapped reads match to a cnv edge, it is assumed that the unaligned portion of the read maps to sequence flanking the other breakpoint and the partially-mapping reads can be aligned to each other to form a consensus sequence that flanks the breakpoint. for example, in the case of a deletion, the partially mapped reads will correspond to sequence flanking the deleted region, giving the exact breakpoints of the cnv. partially-mapped reads map to the reference sequence differently for gains and losses, as described for paired-end mapping methods of cnv detection. where cnv breakpoints lie within non-targeted sequence, partially-mapped reads are unavailable and depth of coverage is the only evidence used for cnv calling. our data were massively parallel sequence reads from a capture design that targets genomic sequence across genes which are known to predispose to high risks of breast and ovarian cancer. a total of kbp sequence was targeted in samples concurrently, running samples per lane on an illumina gaiix instrument. sequencing was performed with a standard multiplex × paired-end reads using truseq sbs chemistry and analyzed with illumina scs /rta and the demultiplexing script within casava http://www.illumina.com. single base coverage was calculated based on the number of tags for each sample overlapping each base across targeted regions. figure illustrates the regional variation in raw coverage and the increase in signal-to-noise ratio after cross-sample normalization for a representative diploid region of brca resulting in ratio values that closely cluster around one in a region with no cnvs in the samples analyzed. we obtained median raw coverage of 350× across the kbp of targeted sequence. low coverage regions were primarily gc-rich, consistent with other targeted sequence data, and account for the majority of bases excluded from screening for structural variation. % of targeted bases had median coverage of at least 10×, permitting high-confidence detection of single base and short indels for nearly all sequence assayed. in order to estimate the effect of random noise on the false-negative rate, we simulated data where one cnv of bp, bp, bp, bp, or bp was present within mb of sequence and tested for detection of the cnv across varying signal-to-noise ratios. this analysis indicated that our methods can detect a bp cnv with 87% sensitivity at a signal-to-noise ratio of a criteria met by > % of the bases targeted in this experiment, and a bp cnv with 80% sensitivity at signal-to-noise ratio of a criteria met by % of the bases. in the samples that passed quality control, we identified a total of cnvs in four genes through depth of coverage analysis that passed minimum coverage and z-score requirements and were confirmed by sanger sequencing or mlpa. for losses, one homozygous deletion and four hemizygous deletions were detected, with no reads from the homozygous deletion and median ratio across hemizygous deletion regions between and. for single copy gains, median duplication ratios were between and. a triplication was also observed with a ratio of, demonstrating that ratio accurately reflects copy number. all samples were previously tested for cnvs in brca and brca and we correctly identified all known mutations and generated no false positive calls in these genes. a size reflects minimum size, as breakpoints are located within flanking repetetive sequence b for homozygous deletion, no reads are present within region cnvs identified within high-risk breast and ovarian cancer genes targeted by this experiment. calls were made via depth of coverage and confirmed with partially-mapped read analysis where possible. after applying depth of coverage methods to detect cnv regions, we mapped sequence reads at the edges of the events to confirm the calls and identify exact breakpoints. this process requires that at least one breakpoint be within unique targeted sequence, as targeted capture generates sequences only over targeted regions and non-unique short sequence tags are difficult or impossible to map accurately. of the cnvs, four deletions were predicted to have at least one breakpoint in unique sequence. using a signature of partially-mapped reads, we confirmed these calls and identified exact breakpoints for all four events. while we identified no duplications with edges in unique sequence, duplications will produce a similar signature to deletions and can be confirmed using the same process. the first deletion, of bp, removes an exon of brca. we confirmed a bp homozygous deletion in brca that matches a known indel, indicating that our method is sensitive to small cnvs. the final two deletions mapped to the same pten coordinates and overlap with a known cnv previously identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. in comparison to acgh methods, we were able to resolve exact breakpoints for this bp polymorphic deletion. importantly, mapping sequence tags to the breakpoints allowed exclusion of a large number of false positive calls. all seven cnvs with breakpoints predicted to be within repetitive non-targeted sequence were validated by sanger sequencing or mlpa. in the kbp in samples there was one cnv called that could not be confirmed. this bp duplication could not be verified through sequence mapping or sanger sequencing and is a likely false positive. breakpoint resolution via partial read mapping reduced the number of false positives to a single duplication across samples and kbp. discussion targeted high-thoughput sequencing data is used to produce high-coverage sequence data on specific regions of the genome. targeted regions are often non-contiguous, as in the case of coding sequence capture or interruptions due to repeat sequences. we created a method that is specific to high-coverage, non-contiguous sequence data for robust cnv detection from targeted sequence data. our method does not require sequencing across cnv breakpoints, but leverages sequence level data for exact cnv characterization where breakpoints are within targeted regions. using a test dataset of regions that contribute to inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, we identified mutations, localizing mutations to exact genomic breakpoints. the minimum size for a cnv that we detected was bp, and there was only one suspected false positive among all samples that passed quality control. our method has several advantages over previous methods used to detect cnvs from high-throughput sequencing. while sequence-based cnv signal is preferable over relative coverage, sequence data is unavailable in targeted data whenever the cnv breakpoints are not in the targeted region. this introduces a major issue for methods that rely on sequence-based data for cnv detection. additionally, as described earlier, paired-end mapping strategies are not currently applicable when targeted enrichment is used. in comparison, relative depth of coverage is problematic due to local variation in coverage within samples and variation in coverage across samples. this leads to problems with false-positive signal when scanning for regions that depart from expected diploid coverage. this issue can be partially addressed by averaging read depth across a genomic region, however, doing so reduces the ability to detect small mutations. by combining ortholgous algorithms, we eliminated from consideration a large number of false-positive cnvs called by depth of coverage methods where no signal of partially-mapped reads was present. the ability to computationally resolve the majority of false-positive calls permitted us to use high-resolution analysis even where signal-to-noise ratio was intermediate. in addition, depth of coverage analysis has the benefit of producing a quantitative estimate of copy-count, as demonstrated by the clear distinction between duplication and triplication ratios. the major limitation of depth of coverage methods arises in duplicated genomic regions, such as segmental duplications or smaller regions of homology between genomic regions. within such regions, the expected ratio for deletions and duplications is relative to the copy count in the genome. for depth of coverage, a copy number change from two to one or two to three produces a strong signal, however, copy number changes in duplicated regions of the genome produce weaker signal that can be easily overwhelmed by noise. for example, variation between samples will overwhelm the signal of a change from six copies to five, where the expected ratio would be. as such, we limit analysis to unique regions of the genome. in addition, depth of coverage methods do not detect balanced structural variation. the methods we describe here were optimized for multiplexed high-coverage data, but we expect the fundamental approach will be applicable to experiments with a larger volume of targeted sequence, such as exome capture. while we used multiplexed data from a relatively small number of targeted bases, the method we describe is scalable and could be used on any dataset where signal-to-noise ratio allows reliable depth of coverage cnv calling. where local variation is too high or coverage too low, average coverage across a genomic window can be used instead of single base coverage, although this lowers resolution to the size of the window used. however, scanning across the window for partially-mapped reads as we do here would still permit exact cnv breakpoint characterization when breakpoints are in targeted sequence.  targeted massively parallel sequencing permits screening of genomic regions for multiple samples simultaneously, and thus is a powerful and cost-effective tool for characterizing mutations in contexts where multiple genes or pathways are involved. we demonstrate that a combination of depth of coverage and analysis of partially-mapped reads allows detection with high-confidence of cnvs within unique sequence, to a resolution of bp. furthermore, we demonstrate that ratio can be used to estimate absolute copy number and that depth of coverage alone is sufficient for cnvs where breakpoints are not represented within targeted regions. the method we describe here is robust, yet simple to implement; while we employ specific mapping and segmentation algorithms, the overall framework is amenable to improvement and variation in the algorithms as massively parallel sequencing technology progresses. "," massively parallel sequencing of barcoded dna samples significantly increases screening efficiency for clinically important genes. short read aligners are well suited to single nucleotide and indel detection. however, methods for cnv detection from targeted enrichment are lacking. we present a method combining coverage with map information for the identification of deletions and duplications in targeted sequence data.  sequencing data is first scanned for gains and losses using a comparison of normalized coverage data between samples. cnv calls are confirmed by testing for a signature of sequences that span the cnv breakpoint. with our method, cnvs can be identified regardless of whether breakpoints are within regions targeted for sequencing. for cnvs where at least one breakpoint is within targeted sequence, exact cnv breakpoints can be identified. in a test data set of subjects sequenced across ~ mb genomic sequence using multiplexing technology, our method detected mutations as small as bp, predicted quantitative copy count, and had a low false-positive rate.  application of this method allows for identification of gains and losses in targeted sequence data, providing comprehensive mutation screening when combined with a short read aligner.

163," since february a novel avian influenza a virus has emerged in china, resulting in human infections. as of sept the chinese cdc reported laboratory-confirmed human cases. according to the etiology and gene traceable results, h7n avian flu virus is a new recombinant virus. human infection with avian influenza a virus usually results in an influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, cough with little to no sputum production, accompanied by headache, muscular soreness, and general malaise. most patients presented with rapidly progressing severe lower respiratory tract infections. considering that the novel avian h7n is characteristic of mammalian adapted, scientific community widespreadly concerns that the emerging reassorted virus could cause a new influenza pandemic. several newly published researches indicated that the h7n virus exhibited human-type receptor-binding ability and could replicate in mammals. h7n virus could invade epithelial cells in human lower respiratory tract and pneumonocytes. these biological characterizations of h7n virus increase the pandemic risk especially that the virus acquires the ability of transmitting readily among humans, and the lack of pre-existing immunity to virus of this subtype among humans. therefore, the risk of a pandemic caused by avian h7n virus requires rapid detection methods. currently, the available detection methods for h7n virus include virus isolation and real-time rt-pcr assay. the serological detection and real-time pcr were recommended to detect avian influenza a in by world health organizatin. considering the requirement for specific equipment and trained operators of real-time rt-pcr assay, there is great demand for simple, rapid and sensitive diagnosis method for early detection of h7n to provide timely treatment and disease control. the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method, first described in has been proved to be a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic method for infectious diseases. previously, the lamp methods have been applied for detection of different subtypes of influenza viruses, including avian h h h h the h1n influenza virus, seasons type a or b influenza virus, and h swine influenza virus. all these assays showed high specificity, efficiency, and sensitivity that were similar to or even higher than real-time pcr assays. these studies exhibited the potential of lamp as a routine diagnostic method for influenza infections. in this study, a h7n9-specific rt-lamp assay targeting the ha or na gene of avian influenza a virus was developed and evaluated with clinical throat swab and avian samples. the results demonstrated that the rt-lamp assay was sensitive and accurate, which could be a useful alternative in clinical diagnostics of influenza a virus, especially in the hospitals and laboratories without sophisticated diagnostic systems.  the primer sets of h or n specific rt-lamp comprise two outer primers, two inner primers, and one loop primer lf that recognize seven distinct regions on the target sequence of ha or na gene. considering that the genomic stability of the emerging reassorted h7n was still unclear, the target sequences of the primers were optimized to avoid covering the hot spot in ha or na gene, such as receptor binding domain or membrane fusion loop in ha gene. after evaluation with different dilutions of h7n viral rna, the primer set was selected.table rt-lamp primer sets designed for detection of h7n virus primer position a length sequence h7fipb ah7n strain a/anhui/1/. bfip and bip primer are long primers containing two separate recognition sequences with a tttt linker. the detection limits of the h and n specific rt-lamp assay were both pfu per reaction, which was 10-fold-higher sensitive than that of real-time rt-pcr assay recommended by who. furthermore, the cross-reactivity tests with seven respiratory viruses also revealed the high specificity of the h7/n rt-lamp assay.figure sensitivity and specificity of the h7/n -specific rt-lamp assay. amplification curves of the h7/n9-special rt-lamp were performed with 10-fold serial dilutions of viral rna. specificities of h and n rt-lamp were tested by using direct visual detection of rt-lamp with rna extracted from viral culture of h1n h3n h5n piv h9n rsv, hadv- and h7n detection limit of h7-specific rt-lamp was pfu per reaction. the color changes under natural or uv light were only observed in the tube of h7n viral rna by using h7-specific rt-lamp assay. detection limit of n9-specific rt-lamp was pfu per reaction. the color changes were observed for n9-specific rt-lamp reaction with h7n viral rna. no color change was seen in rt-lamp with other subtype of influenza viral rna and other three respiratory viruses under natural or uv light. comparison of detection of h7n virus by using rt-lamp and rrt-pcr assay strain virus titer rrt-pcr rrt-pcr rt-lamp rt-lamp and, not detectable. discussion the rt-lamp assay could finish within 45 minutes. by using fluorescent detection reagent, the positive amplification could be observed by color change. as shown in the figure 1b and d, the color of positive reaction change from orange to green under natural light, while the positive reaction also produced bright green fluorescence under uv light. for negative sample such as h1n h3n h5n piv h9n rsv and hadv- virus, the color of reaction mixture did not change either under normal light or under uv light. the h7/n9-specific rt-lamp assay was further evaluated using clinical samples and chicken samples compared with rrt-pcr assay. the rt-lamp results showed that samples were tested to be positive and the other samples were negative for h7n respectively, which could be confirmed by rrt-pcr assay. no false positive and false negative were observed. by using these samples, 100% diagnostic sensitivities were achieved with h or n specific rt-lamp assay compared with rrt-pcr assays, which showed that rt-lamp results were consistent with that of rrt-pcr. the lamp method aimed to detect avian influenza h7n showed reliable results in the detection of avian and human clinical samples. previously, two rt-lamp systems had been developed for detection of avian influenza subtype h virus. currently, some other rt-lamp assays for detection of h7n virus were also developed. these assays showed excellent sensitivities and specificities. our h7/n9-specific rt-lamp assays, as well as those published rt-lamp methods, were very useful for the early detection of suspected h7n infection, and could contribute to the prevention and control of h7n epidemics and potential pandemic in china and other asian countries.  the current study described a rapid, accurate and feasible h7/n specific rt-lamp assay with perfect sensitivities and high specificities. it was simple and easy to perform. this assay have the potential to provide useful tools for detection of novel h7n virus especially in resource-limited setting, which will play important roles in the prevention and control of spread of novel h7n infection. "," the emerged human infection with avian influenza a virus in china since has aroused global concerns. there is great demand for simple and rapid diagnostic method for early detection of h7n to provide timely treatment and disease control. the aim of the current study was to develop a rapid, accurate and feasible reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of h7n virus.  the detection limits of the h7- and n9-specific rt-lamp assay were both approximately pfu per reaction. no cross-reactivity was observed with other subtype of influenza viruses or common respiratory viral pathogens. the assay worked well with clinical specimens from patients and chickens, and exhibited high specificity and sensitivity.  the h7/n specific rt-lamp assay was sensitive and accurate, which could be a useful alternative in clinical diagnostics of influenza a virus, especially in the hospitals and laboratories without sophisticated diagnostic systems. keywords influenza virush7n subtypereverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplificationmolecular diagnosisissue-copyright-statement© the author 2014 ",1ea621d5-01ed-4fec-a087-d723d15bea98,pubmed
164," leishmaniasis is endemic in many areas of tropical and subtropical america, where it constitutes a significant public health problem. the disease in this region is basically a zoonosis; humans are only incidental hosts in the life cycles of the various pathogenic parasite species. in america, zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis is caused by leishmania infantum, and domestic dogs are established as reservoir hosts. visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in european, asiatic and africa countries, and new areas in which the infection is being disseminated are being identified. canine visceral leishmaniasis exists in about of the countries in which human leishmaniasis is present, and there are three major foci: china, the mediterranean basin and brazil. control of leishmaniasis in the new world is complicated by the variety of different leishmania species and their diverse clinical manifestations, and by the fact that each parasite species has a unique epidemiological pattern. since a combined risk exists for both canine and human infections in areas where zvl is endemic, there is a need for sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques. serological testing can identify exposure to the parasite but cannot indicate an active infection. some years ago, the reference standard for diagnosis was the demonstration of parasite by either microscopy or culture of aspirates from spleen, lymph nodes or bone marrow. however, the overall sensitivity of these methods in humans and dogs is variable and relatively poor. direct parasite detection on histological skin biopsies, which can be obtained by an extremely simple surgical procedure, is a good tool for a definitive diagnosis and for clinical follow-up of dogs undergoing treatment. however, examination of routinely prepared histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin is frequently inconclusive, particularly in the skin. immunohistochemical detection of leishmania amastigotes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of canine and human tissues has previously been described and is routinely used in many laboratories. recently, an alternative immunohistochemical method was described that could be a useful tool for epidemiological, clinical and histopathological studies. in the last decade, the polymerase chain reaction was shown to be sensitive and specific for demonstrating leishmania dna. in recent years, pcr has considerably improved the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis, showing to 100% sensitivity in symptomatically or parasitologically confirmed cases. a variety of canine tissues including bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, skin and conjunctival biopsy specimens have been used for diagnosis. blood and bone marrow are the most frequently used tissues for pcr diagnosis in dogs; however, the skin is considered an important tissue reservoir of parasites in both healthy and sick leishmania-infected dogs. moreover, positive pcr has been shown to be a better indicator in skin than in bone marrow or conjunctiva. pcr using noninvasively obtained samples will be useful for epidemiological studies and for direct diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. the aim of this study was to compare three indirect methods for detecting leishmania in canine skin biopsies obtained from different anatomical regions. histopathological, immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction methods for detection of leishmania were analyzed and their relative efficacies were considered.  histologically, skin samples showed a chronic inflammatory reaction irrespective of anatomical region, but this reaction varied with the animal's clinical status. in general, the reaction ranged in intensity from discrete to moderate. however, an intense inflammatory process was more frequent in some cases. it was detected only in ear skin biopsies from oligosymptomatic and symptomatic animals. in general, the chronic inflammatory reaction was characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate and was diffuse in the upper dermis and focal around vessels, pyli and glands of the deep dermis. parasites were more readily identified in ear biopsies than in biopsies from nose and abdominal samples, but the parasite load determined by optical microscopy showed no statistical differences. however, there was a tendency towards a higher parasite load in ear skin tissue specimens than in the others. numerous imunolabeled amastigote forms of leishmania were readily observed in skin tissues. moreover, the ihc method improved the he parasite load data. in addition, when we compared the parasite load with the definite clinical status of the animal, the numbers of positive symptomatic dogs were higher than asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic ones. like the he results, the ihc parasite tissue load data showed no clear relationship to the inflammatory infiltrate. moreover, we found symptomatic animals with an intense inflammatory infiltrate but without amastigotes, and asymptomatic animals with a discrete inflammatory reaction but many macrophages loaded with amastigotes. the sensitivities of the tests used were calculated using optical microscopy as gold standard. all animals were om positive. pcr was positive in dogs, ihc in and he in the sensitivities were therefore % for pcr, % for ihc and % for he. when we compared the pcr, ihc and he methods according clinical status using ear, nose and abdomen skin samples, there was higher positivity for pcr than ihc and he, respectively, for all clinical groups. the asymptomatic positivity was higher for pcr method. however, the sample size was not large enough to qualify for statistical significance. in according to table considering the three methods together for leishmania detection with skin biopsies from different anatomical regions we found the following results: pcr is better than ihc and he for ear skin biopsies; nose skin biopsies give statistically different results for all diagnostic methods, pcr detecting more positive cases followed by ihc and he; abdominal biopsies show no statistically significant results for any of the three methods. in addition, the comparison of the skin biopsies from different anatomical regions for each diagnosis method did not show any statistical differences. this means that one anatomical skin region is no more useful than any other for a given test method. index κ was used to calculate the agreement among the three tests. ihc and pcr agreement well for ear and abdomen skin tissues, but weakly for nose. pcr and he agreement weakly for ear, abdomen and nose. ihc and he agreement optimally for ear and abdomen and showed good agreement for nose. discussion serological techniques for diagnosing leishmania such as the immunofluorescence antibody test, direct agglutination test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, dot-elisa and western blot are widely used. although they are clinically very useful, these methods underestimate the infection rate of leishmania in dog populations in endemic areas. for canine visceral leishmaniasis, no technique is 100% sensitive and specific and can serve as ""gold standard"" for diagnosis, but direct observation of the parasite in stained smears or tissue sections must be regarded as conclusive. in the last decade, pcr has had the greatest success because of its high sensitivity and specificity. pcr can be carried out using genomic or kinetoplast parasite dna on blood, skin, lymph node, conjunctiva or bone marrow samples from infected animals. however, although blood and bone-marrow are mostly used, skin merits special consideration. dogs naturally infected with l. infantum harbor high numbers of parasites in skin irrespective of the presence of lesions. moreover, skin tissue is a good substrate for pcr diagnosis. few publications have considered application of pcr to different canine tissues for detecting leishmania infection. solano-gallego et al. showed that 51% of positive animals were identified from skin analysis versus 32% from conjunctiva and % from bone marrow. moreover, pcr results from specimens of skin have demonstrated higher sensitivity than spleen, liver, lymph nodes or bone marrow. in this work we considered he, ihc and pcr methods for detecting leishmania in three different skin biopsies. all samples utilized were embedded in paraffin and maintained at room temperature. this is important, especially for pcr, because it works even after a long storage time. based on the mo method as ""gold standard"" for diagnosis, the sensitivities of the three methods were: pcr %, ihc % and he %. the pcr sensitivity value accords with previous work: 60%, %, 87% and up to 100%. we have not found ihc or he sensitivity values in the literature. the use of ihc to detect amastigotes in canine tissues has been reported previously and has undoubtedly proved efficient for diagnosis. in this paper we employed a straightforward and inexpensive immunohistochemical approach for detecting leishmania in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine tissues. we still do not have conclusive results for absolute sensitivity values, but our data show an increase in the number of positive animals when ihc is compared to he. indeed, bourdoiseau et al. reported that he is a good tool for describing lesions, but has low sensitivity for detecting leishmania. in according to table pcr was higher positive absolute numbers in asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic dogs and pcr, he or ihc was independent of the clinical status and tissue origin. however, our sample size was not large enough to qualify for statistical significance. thus, we did not find statistical difference among the three methods in respect of the clinical status of the animals or the anatomical region from which the skin biopsy was taken. this could indicates that asymptomatic dogs have parasites in the skin just as symptomatic dogs do, underlining the importance of asymptomatic dogs in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis, as discussed by abranches et al. in portugal, solano-gallego et al. in spain and lima et al. in brazil. solano-gallego et al., for example, showed that pcr was able to detect subclinical canine leishmania infection. pcr, ihc and he were simultaneously studied in the three different canine skin samples. pcr was better than ihc and he for ear and nose skin samples. as pcr method is able to demonstrate leishmania dna in the investigate samples, it could explained these data. optical microscopy revealed parasites easier in ear skin specimens than in nose or abdomen samples. in addition, the chronic inflammatory reaction in ear samples was more intense in oligosymptomatic and symptomatic dogs. on the other hand, pcr detected higher numbers of positive animals, followed by ihc and he; in this case, ihc was better than he. it is important to say that ihc improved the detection of positive infection by almost fifty percent over he, as depicted in fig. pcr, ihc and he data on the abdomen skin samples showed no statistical differences. these results corroborated the he and ihc results, because abdomen skin specimens showed lower inflammation and parasite load in all cases.  taking these results together, we can suggest that pcr was the best method for diagnosing canine infection by leishmania. however, we can not infer what skin anatomical regions is the best for diagnosing the infection. on the other side, ear skin biopsies is a non-invasive procedure and easier to perform than skin biopsies of other anatomical regions. moreover, it is less blood-irrigated and the anatomical location is more comfortable for both the animal and the veterinary practitioner. thus, we think that pcr skin ear biopsy could be used as the best method for diagnosing canine infection by leishmania. however, precautions have to be taken in order to interpret pcr results as a signal of animal infectivity, because pcr positive detection does not necessarily indicate alive parasites in tissues. until now it has not be demonstrated that all pcr positive dogs are infective. the good agreement between pcr and ihc indicates that ihc can be used as an alternative method. finally, skin samples from ears, nose and abdomen, mainly ears and nose, are a potentially useful tissue source for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis independently of the animal's clinical status. "," we compared skin biopsy samples from different anatomical regions for detecting leishmania in dogs, using histological, immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction techniques.  the sensitivity was percent for pcr, percent for ihc and percent for he. these methods do not appear to depend on the clinical status of the animal or the anatomical source of the skin sample; there is no ""best region"" for any method. however, pcr was more effective than ihc and he for ear and nose skin samples whereas ihc was better than he for nose samples. there was weak agreement between pcr and he for all tissue samples; good agreement between pcr and ihc for ear and abdomen samples, and weak agreement for nose; and optimal agreement between ihc and he for ear and abdomen and good agreement for nose samples.  the pcr on ear skin could be the best procedure for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis. the good agreement between pcr and ihc indicates that ihc can be used as an alternative method. finally, tissue samples from ears, nose and abdomen, particularly ears and nose, are potentially useful for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis independently of the animal's clinical status.

165," gene expression profiling using microarrays plays an important role in many areas of biology. microarray data however often contains many missing values. among the most commonly used computer analysis tools that require imputation of missing values are data dimensionality reducing algorithms such as principal component analysis and singular value decomposition, and machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines. advanced imputation methods have therefore been developed, such as knnimpute, bayesian pca and llsimpute, which all are based on correlations between available measurements in the data matrix. in knnimpute, e.g., a weighted average of the k most similar genes is used to derive an estimate of a missing value in the gene of interest. missing values and the choice of imputation method has also been shown to affect the significance analysis of differentially expressed genes. missing values can occur due to dust or scratches on the slide, spotting problems or hybridization problems. obviously problematic spots are manually flagged as missing and are removed from further analysis. it is customary to subtract background intensities from the spot intensity, and this also produces missing values. negative background-corrected intensities arise if the spot intensity is comparable to the background intensity, either due to contamination of the spot, leakage from neighbouring spots, or from low abundance of dyed cdna in the reference or sample. obviously, the choice of spot quality assessment and transform of intensities of the resulting values will influence the final result of imputation as well as the analysis as a whole. error models, and transforms other than the logarithm, have been developed, designed to give reliable variance estimates in the absence of replicates or generate a well-defined distribution of expression values. however, more heuristic approaches remain in use. one reason could be that many transforms or weights require careful tuning of parameters, which tend to be platform dependent, and perhaps even dataset specific. results from experiments designed to determine such parameters are not always available. another reason is that the biological variation within traits tends to dominate over technical variation. when the study is large enough to get a reliable sample estimate of the total variation within traits, there is less need for information on technical variation alone. furthermore, instead of relying on a specific distribution of expression values, p-values and false discovery rates are often obtained by non-parametric tests or empirical methods such as permutation tests. in heuristic analyses, some spot quality control is still performed, often in terms of threshold values in observables such as spot size, intensity, background variation, or combinations thereof, which are used to flag spots as missing. an undesired feature of this approach is the sharp threshold effects. a spot with an observable, say reference intensity, just below the chosen threshold will be deemed ""completely unreliable"", while a spot with essentially the same intensity, but just above the threshold will be considered ""perfectly reliable"". different smoothings of threshold effects have therefore been developed. smoothing introduces continuous weights, ranging from for missing or ""completely unreliable"" measurements, to for ""perfectly reliable"" ones, but also taking on values in between. the chosen weight is related to some commonly used threshold observables and threshold values, typically tuned to be about 1/ at the otherwise adopted threshold. weights w associated to the expression values x can be used to improve imputation. for every spot, measured as well as missing, an imputed value ximp is calculated and an adjusted value x' = wx + ximp is used in the subsequent analysis. thus, missing and ""completely unreliable"" values x are replaced by ximp, ""perfectly reliable"" measurements x are kept, and spots with weights between and will end up with an expression value somewhere between the imputed and the directly measured value. weighted imputation requires a weight definition which ranges from to this property is used in eq. and in the selection of the number of nearest neighbours. the range constraint on the weights excludes weighting schemes that combine an error model estimate of the variance σ with a weight motivated by maximum likelihood, w = 1/σ instead, weights representing a smoothing of an otherwise adopted threshold filter satisfy the range constraint. for 2-dye cdna microarrays, it is common to impute missing values using the data matrix of log intensity ratios. in this approach, no information as to why a measurement is missing is included. it is also possible to impute intensities for each channel separately and form the log ratio from them. different forms of missing values are then handled differently, but the imputation of a missing intensity is performed without use of the information provided by the other channel of the same spot. we divided missing values of 2-dye cdna data into three categories; those that are missing due to a missing sample intensity only, a missing reference intensity only, or other reasons. we examined if this categorization can be used to improve imputation of expression values. we wanted to investigate imputation of one-channel depleted spots using the best imputation scheme available. we therefore worked with the weighted version presented in and described in our methods section.  imputation of one-channel depleted spots is biased the weighted imputation final result x' can be written x' = ximp + w. for one-channel depleted spots, the fact that the opposite channel was measurable provides information which is neglected when we set the weight to for example, sample depleted spots are those for which the sample channel is missing, while a measurable reference channel indicates a good quality spot, which suggests a low expression. if this qualitative statement ""low"" is not completely unreliable, warranting a non-zero weight, our final result would be x' = ximp + ""some w > 0"" ×. to quantify this pseudo-mathematical formula, we asked ourselves if ""low"" meant ""lower than ximp"", at least on average, for sd spots. if so, the relation can be written x' = ximp + ""some negative correction"". we used datasets with duplicate measurements to test this. for some of the duplicates, one measurement is sd while the other is known. we used the known duplicate as the best available estimate of the value that the sd spot should have, and compared this control value with the imputed value. similarly, reference depleted spots are those for which the sample channel is measurable, in spite of the poor spot quality indicated by a missing reference, suggesting a high expression. we used the same datasets and compared the imputed values of rd spots with known duplicate controls, to test if the qualitative statements ""some w > 0"" and ""high"" motivated a positive correction of the imputed value for rd spots. table shows that for one-channel depleted spots, the imputed value has a mean deviation from the duplicate much larger than expected by random, while the bias for other spots is more comparable to random expectation. furthermore, the md signs are in agreement with the hypotheses that sample- and reference depletion provide useful information about down- and up-regulation, respectively. thus, though we could not a priori be certain that the pseudo-mathematical expression ""some w > 0"" × implies ""some negative correction"", we found that it does so, in five different datasets produced on different platforms by different experimental groups, investigating both primary tissue and cell lines. above, we referred to the weighted scheme to motivate why we looked for an imputation bias, but it should be pointed out that the result, that bias exists, is more general. we also performed imputation with binarized weights as in, so that all weights below were set to and all others to this corresponds to unweighted knnimpute, and we then found similar biases. corrections calibrated on training set duplicate controls improves imputation in validation set the next obvious step was to design and evaluate a correction of the observed bias. in datasets with duplicates, the simplest possible correction is just a constant shift removing the bias found in duplicates where one measurement is sd while the other is known. the calibrated correction can then be applied to all sd spots. duplicates used to calibrate the correction are useless as controls. therefore, we tested the constant shift correction in a cross-validation scheme described in methods. the md in the validation set was found to be comparable to random expectation. a change of md to a new md' will change the mean square deviation by - table shows that this corresponds to a reduction of msd varying from % to 51%, depending on dataset, with a median of 14%. thus, a constant shift removing the mean deviation on a subset of samples reduces the mean square deviation on another subset of samples. in summary, a correction calibrated on a subset of samples can be used to essentially remove the bias and reduce the msd in another subset of samples. corrected imputation increases overall variance without reducing signals for de-regulation next, we wanted to assess the impact of bias correction for finding differentially expressed reporters. we therefore tested imputation with and without missing value categorization in a more realistic analysis, where duplicates were being merged rather than kept apart for imputation control. we combined merging and imputation as described in methods. for the lymphoma dataset, we constructed reporter lists for the reporters with largest variation across arrays after wenni, with and without the modification. the reporters were ranked on pearson correlation to clinical outcome. in this dataset, the number of sd and rd spots correlated with good and bad clinical outcome, respectively, with an odds ratio of. this correlation manifested itself with a shift towards more positive pearson scores with modified imputation, see figure however, the distribution of score magnitudes did not change much, and the false discovery rates, estimated from random sample label permutations, gave also very similar results for the two approaches. we also studied how the reporter standard deviation changed when applying the correction, and found that the variation increased for the vast majority of the modified reporters, see figure this implies that more reporters would survive a variation filter after correction, and would be kept for further analysis, thus allowing for a better sensitivity. the same analysis was also performed in the mec tumour dataset, with very similar results.  we show that conventional imputation of 2-dye cdna data gives biased estimates of expression for missing values where only one channel is missing. we present the simplest possible correction, just a constant shift calibrated on duplicate controls, which can be used to improve imputation for these one-channel depleted spots. the method does not apply to experiments where the two dyes are used for pairwise comparison of biological traits, but it is applicable to all 2-dye cdna microarray data with a common reference on all arrays, and with at least some duplicates, to allow for calibration. in principle, common reference experiments with dye swap arrays can be corrected for bias in one-channel depleted spots, as long as the reference channel is properly identified on each array. with the datasets available in this study, a possible benefit from dye-specific corrections could not be investigated. we speculate that the missing value categorization is more useful in smaller datasets where the knn-based method is less likely to find the correlations needed for a successful imputation. this is supported by table where the three smallest datasets lymphoma, mec cell lines and mec tumours show the greatest improvement. furthermore, datasets with homogeneous classes, such as extensively facs-sorted cell populations, or replicates of transfected cell-lines, are probably more likely to contain those consistently strong down-regulated genes that will be correctly characterized as sample depleted. in fact, we can see that in the mec tumour and cell line datasets where the samples represent distinct gene expression phenotypes, the sd spots outnumber the rd spots in contrast to the other datasets, where rd spots are more common than sd spots. in these cases, the imputation method proposed here may not only help create complete data matrices for algorithmic purposes, but may also identify strongly down-regulated genes that would not be found to be differentially expressed by conventional imputation. "," for 2-dye microarray platforms, some missing values may arise from an un-measurably low rna expression in one channel only. information of such ""one-channel depletion"" is so far not included in algorithms for imputation of missing values.  calculating the mean deviation between imputed values and duplicate controls in five datasets, we show that knn-based imputation gives a systematic bias of the imputed expression values of one-channel depleted spots. evaluating the correction of this bias by cross-validation showed that the mean square deviation between imputed values and duplicates were reduced up to 51%, depending on dataset.  by including more information in the imputation step, we more accurately estimate missing expression values.

166," lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins found in various organisms including fungi. despite the large amount of informations available on lectin sequence and specificity, relatively little is known about their biological significances. the abundance and the variety of carbohydrate specificities of lectins raised the interest to use them for isolation and analysis of complex carbohydrates, cell separation and studies of cell surface architecture. for a long period, legume lectins were the model system of choice to study the molecular basis of carbohydrate-lectin recognition. they are easy to purify in large quantities, and they exhibit a wide variety of carbohydrate specificities despite strong sequence conservation. mushroom lectins have captured the attention of investigators on account of their antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, antitumor and cytotoxic activities, and more than mushroom lectins have been reported. we recently isolated a lectin from xerocomus chrysenteron. the x ray crystal structure resolution of xcl revealed a tetrameric assembly and an unexpectedly similarity with actinoporins. xcl was reported as an insecticidal protein and shares antiproliferative properties against two mammalian cell lines. we can also mention agaricus bisporus lectin, another mushroom lectin well known for its reversible antiproliferative effects. abl is a member of a group of proteins, which bind the thomsen-friedenreich antigen selectively and with high affinity. tf antigen is represented by galactosyl β- 3-n-acetylgalactosamine and is common in malignant and pre-malignant epithelia. there are three other well known dietary tf-binding lectins: jacalin from the seeds of jackfruit artocarpus integrifolia, the peanut lectin from peanut arachis hypogaea, and amaranth lectin from amaranthus caudatus. these four lectins have been used in histochemistry for identification of the tf antigen in tissues. as previously reported by rosen and al., abl belongs to a lectin fungi family based on sequence homology and n-acetylgalactosamine and galactose affinity. at present this family contains: agaricus bisporus lectin, arthrobotrys oligospora lectin, xerocomus chrysenteron lectin, pleurotus cornucopiae lectin, gibberella zeae lectin, paxilus involutus lectin. the sequence homology between xcl and its family members varies from 65% to 35% suggesting that all these lectins could recognize tf antigen. here we focus on xcl binding constants for specific sugars and quantify the underlying thermodynamic parameters of the carbohydrate-xcl lectin interactions by direct measurement of the enthalpy using isothermal titration calorimetry method. we found that xcl recognizes tf antigen with high affinity.  sugar – xcl interaction red blood cell agglutination by xcl was inhibited when galactose, lactose and n-acetylgalactosamine was added to the system but no effect was seen with glucose, fucose, fructose, sorbitol, mannose and sucrose. we first performed a titration of lactose and galactose to the protein, however the low binding affinity of both sugars was below the detection limit of the method. subsequently, we investigated the n-acetylgalactosamine/xcl interaction. with n-acetylgalactosamine, the acetamide group on the galactose ring can bring one more hydrogen bond, which can contribute to the enthalpy of the reaction and affinity values, and then titration was possible. binding of carbohydrates to a number of proteins is characterised by small enthalpy and heat capacity changes. hydrogen bonding interactions are essentially enthalpically driven with little change in the heat capacity, while hydrophobic interactions are essentially entropically driven. measurements performed at 10°c using the same titration conditions indicate that the enthalpy of binding of n-acetylgalactosamine does not vary significantly with temperature and small changes in the heat capacity are observed. the fit of the data with one set of site model gave an affinity value of m- and no important change of the reaction enthalpy was observed. in many cases, binding of saccharides to lectins is coupled to changes in solvent accessibility that result in negative, albeit small, Δcp values. this is also the case of xcl – n-acetylgalactosamine interaction. variation of osmotic stress allows to measure the energetic contribution of the solvatation effect on the enthalpy of the reaction. the water activity was reduced by adding % peg to the system. an increase in the binding constant value and a reduction of the binding enthalpy were observed. thermodynamics parameters, which characterize the xcl – n-acetylgalactosamine interaction are summarised in table the Δg values and the deduced binding constants are higher at low temperature or under osmotic stress. the n-acetyllactosamine was also used as a ligand and the affinity constant at 27°c is in the range of m- but with significant errors. these errors are due to an uncertainty in fitting the data at ka values of smaller than m- we especially checked the xcl interaction for tf antigen, β-d-gal-d-galnac, since abl was previously shown to bind this disaccharide with a high affinity constant. a Δh value of - kcal/mole and an affinity constant of m- were obtained. this value is fold higher than the affinity constant determined for n-acetylgalactosamine interaction. glycoproteins – xcl interaction fetuin and asialofetuin, which bear the tf antigen motif, were used to test xcl interactions with glycoproteins. fetuin contains six oligosaccharides chains, namely three carbohydrate units o-linked to thr or ser residues and three complex glycans, n-linked to asn residues. a fourth o-linked residue may exist in the fetuin structure. in fetuin, the exposed gal residues of both o-linked and n-linked saccharides are linked to sialic acid residues, which are absent in asialofetuin. several titrations of fetuin and asialofetuin to a xcl containing solution were performed at 27°c. the binding isotherms for the titration of fetuin and asialofetuin into a xcl solution are presented in figure 3a and 3b respectively and the thermodynamic data are presented in table affinity constant for asialofetuin was found times higher than for fetuin. this suggests that xcl binds asialofetuin more avidly than the native fetuin, and therefore that the presence of sialic acid reduces the affinity of xcl towards such glycans. the binding stoichiometry is of, which could correspond to similar binding sites either on fetuin or asialofetuin. the binding enthalpy of xcl – fetuin/asialofetuin is of - kcal/mole and - kcal/mole respectively. this significant difference in the binding enthalpies of almost kcal/mole leads us to conclude that in fetuin the sialic acids do contribute to the energy of binding. discussion as we mentioned in the introduction, there are several tf-binding lectins. althought they recognize the same motif, they have different actions on the proliferation phenomenon. for example, pna stimulates the proliferation of human intestinal epithelial cells while abl is a potent inhibitor of proliferation. the fact that xcl shows a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation suggests that its effects could be mediated by glycoproteins bearing tf antigen. we first check the binding of xcl with free tf antigen. our results lead us to suggest that water molecules involved in the sugar-lectin binding may contribute to the energy of the reaction. this is in agreement with the chevernak and toone work since the amount of heat liberated on the binding of ligands with a variety of proteins was significantly smaller when heavy water was used like solvent. in the case of xcl, the affinity enhancement observed when the galactose is linked to the n-acetylgalactosamine suggests the existence of an extended binding site. an increase in the binding enthalpy is also observed when disaccharides replace monosaccharides in xcl-sugar complexes. this increase correlates with the addition of direct hydrogen bonds and more extensive van der waals interactions between the protein and the ligand. sugar binding site determined on abl by rx crystallography shows that water molecules are involved in this interaction as we hypothesised. on cell-surface glycoproteins, the epitope structure of tf antigen is α-linked to either serines or threonines. the affinity constants of xcl obtained for fetuin and asialofetuin are higher than for free tf antigen. this difference could be explained by an implication of several residues of the glycoprotein in the interaction with the lectin. nevertheless, residues potentially involved in this interaction are not serine or threonine linking tf antigen. then it would be interesting to investigate the implication of the spatially surrounding residues in this interaction.  at present, only limited informations on the thermodynamics datas of the lectin-sugar recognition are available and much work remains to be done to understand the underlying forces that govern these interactions. in this study, we investigate the specificity of xcl for carbohydrates and especially for thomsen-friedenreich antigen and glycoproteins bearing this disaccharide. kinetic studies using a resonant mirror biosensor reported a binding affinity value of m- for the asialofetuin-abl interaction which is very close to that of the asialofetuin-xcl interaction. the xcl antiproliferative effect and the tf antigen specificity presented in this work suggest that xcl and abl may have similar binding mechanisms. the recent structure determination of xcl and abl lead us to currently analyse these interactions in the light of our thermodynamic data. "," lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins which potentially bind to cell surface glycoconjugates. they are found in various organisms including fungi. a lectin from the mushroom xerocomus chrysenteron has been isolated recently. it shows insecticidal activity and has antiproliferative properties.  as the monosaccharide binding specificity is an important determinant of lectin function, we determined the affinity of xcl for the galactose moiety. isothermal titration calorimetry studies revealed a dissociation constant kd of μm for the xcl:n-acetylgalactosamine interaction at 27degreesc. higher affinities were observed at lower temperatures and higher osmotic pressures. the dissociation constant was five hundred times higher for the disaccharide beta-d-gal-d-galnac, thomsen-friedenreich antigen. by using fetuin and asialofetuin in interaction with the xcl, we revealed its ability to recognize the thomsen-friedenreich motif on glycoproteins.  the xcl antiproliferative effect and the tf antigen specificity presented in this work suggest that xcl and abl may have similar binding mechanisms. the recent structure determination of these two proteins lead us to analyse these interactions in the light of our thermodynamic data. the understanding of this type of interaction may be a useful tool for the regulation of cell proliferation.

167," the breadth of knowledge of microbial diversity continues to rapidly expand as 16s rrna genes are sequenced from environmental samples and comparisons to existing data are drawn. culture-independent methods have enabled the application of a molecular-phylogenetic approach to discover that the environmental microbes constitute the majority of evolutionary diversity. phylogenetic studies have further recognized that over 99% of all prokaryotes are uncultivated. therefore, in attempts to continue to explore the evolution and composition of microbial communities it is now standard practice to sequence the 16s rrna gene. these dna sequences are being added to public databases rapidly since they have become the most cost effective, if not the only method available to identify and quantify the uncultivated microbes. deriving meaningful knowledge from the inundation of sequences, then, necessitates methods to judge which sequences are of particular interest to the study. a common method in screening dna sequences derived in a study is to assign each sequence to a taxonomic group by comparing it to the closest relative in publically available databases, such as greengene’s simrank and ncbi’s blastn. although this method is rapid, it has been recognized that neither the top ranking hits nor the most similar sequences are always the most closely related phylotype. phylotypes may also be determined to be closely related by examining the network of sequence relationships based on their similarities. a network is established using the following principle: if sequences a, b, and c each return sequence a as a blastn hit, sequence a is considered to be “associated” with the three sequences. in the context of screening the sequences derived from environmental samples, analyzing the associations between the blastn hits of a collection will unveil sequences of great phylogenetic interest despite the possibility of having scored low in the blastn ranking system. recognizing these associations before aligning large collections of sequences reduces both the computational expense and the obfuscation that many sequences will inherently contribute to its analysis. here we introduce a web application, phylometrics, which automates many key tasks for dna sequence analysis in a high-throughput method. instead of single blastn inquiries, phylometrics automatically analyzes multiple blastn results, cross-comparing each blastn result against others within seconds. a graphical tool for mining these sequence relationships is also provided and includes them in a multiple sequence alignment process according to user-defined parameters. this approach can discover sequences of great interest for further phylogenetic examination which would otherwise be missed without significant human involvement. finally, the application generates phylogenetic trees according to numerous methods of tree inference which may be selected and configured using a wizard-style form. as the results are being generated, the user may continue to interact and queue additional analyses without interrupting the ongoing processes. phylometrics offers a number of key advantages: simplicity in the user interface, powerful analytics to examine sequence relationships, the ability to install the application locally and the ability to queue batch jobs. the code is also released as open source allowing it to be extended and integrated into workflows as desired. finally, due to the architectural decision to make the application driven by job queues, cloud computing services may be integrated and directed by the queue to perform the more cpu-intensive processes such as multiple sequence alignments. implementation design aims many popular tools available for sequence analysis require command-line syntax and cryptic parameter settings that are foreign to biologists without programming experience. we identified four design aims for the system: implement a simple, widely usable interface that does not involve user programming, by implementing a wizard-styled approach. provide rich, interactive visual representations of the data generated by the pipeline. allow for the import of sequences in multiple formats and the export of data at every stage of the pipeline so as to give the user the flexibility to use alternative software solutions for those steps. furthermore, the system must maintain a record of the parameters the user set for each step in the pipeline. allow batch jobs to be queued and/or running while being able to simultaneously create new jobs or able to access completed reports. these goals were met by architecting phylometrics with three main components: the web browser, a script-processing engine running on a web server and a database server. a flash-enabled web browser, without any other plugin requirements, acts as the user interface and offers the unique advantage of not requiring a high-performance device and also allows the system to be accessed remotely. the back end is coded in php using a model-view-controller object-oriented programming paradigm, making it an extendable application. phylometrics uses the open source mysql database server to store sequence collections and reports. user interface and pipeline wizard a common web browser serves as the user interface. it is advantageous due to the low learning curve and accessibility from a number of devices. it also incorporates simple yet useful features such as printing and searching from within the browser experience. phylometrics implements a wizard-style pipeline which prompts the user for parameters necessitated at each pipeline stage. the first step in the process is creating a new “collection” by importing sequences for analysis. on importing, a sequence record is created for each sequence and associated with a collection record which is then pushed through the pipeline. the second step of the wizard is “blast setup.” the software queries ncbi’s live database by default; this may be modified, however, to search a local blastn database instead. after entering blastn parameter options, the user has the ability to “generate a screening report,” or to continue with the pipeline. both processes are queued and allow the user to continue to use the system, while the option to generate the screening report will halt the pipeline at this second step before continuing the progression through the pipeline. a screening report will be generated irrespective of the choice the user makes at this point, allowing one to revisit this report to create any number of alignments and trees based on their filters. the following step is “alignment” with the options to select parameters based on clustalw, a multiple sequence alignment program. once the screening report is generated, users may choose to create alignments using various filters which set thresholds, gate and also specifically toggle individual sequences. in fact, one can use the same dataset to create many alignments using different parameters and compare the results in the generated trees. the final step of the wizard is “build tree”, where one can choose between various methods of tree inferences based on the phylip and phyml software packages. the newick file format outputs of these packages are then rendered into images using treevector. similar to the many-to-one relationship of alignments to collections, many trees can be generated from one alignment. interactive visual analytics an interactive analytical tool developed in adobe flex and utilizing the flare library is used to represent sequence relationship networks. the user is prompted to select a number of filtering criteria from which a report is generated, including the minimum number of associations a blastn hit must have with individual supplied sequences. the report itself is interactive; scrolling over a sequence name with the mouse will reveal the sequence accession identification and description. clicking a sequence name will highlight the relationship associations with other sequences based on the results obtained in blastn reports. data usability sequences are initially imported by the user into a “collection” from the wizard in fasta, genbank or raw format. on wizard completion, the user is be able to download the blastn report in xml format, the multiple sequence alignments in phylip format, and the tree inferences in newick, svg and png file formats. the user may also click on the generated results to review the parameters that were used to generate the reports within the wizard process. asynchronous job queues the pipeline processing and job queues are managed by perl scripts which utilize the bioperl library. these scripts are decoupled from the system in such a way so as to allow them to be run on a completely separate hardware platform, receiving job instructions from the database layer. this setup allows the user to continue to access and analyze generated reports while jobs are processing, in addition to being able to queue an unlimited number of jobs. as the tasks progress through the pipeline an unobtrusive panel displays the progress of each submitted job. furthermore, this setup can be exploited to process jobs which are computationally expensive on other servers simultaneously or even utilize cloud computing services such as amazon ec  we have compared the features of phylometrics to a number of tools that are commonly used for small-subunit rna analyses that offer differing advantages. many phylogenetic tools utilize standard programs such as clustalw and phyml to perform common tasks. phylometrics utilizes these and other standard packages, and therefore does not differ from other pipelines or packages in these core functions. thus, the performance on identical hardware will be similar. for instance, a representative collection of sequences pushed through the full pipeline with default settings required minutes on a windows server with a modest ghz single-core processor and 1gb ram. phylometrics differentiates itself from these tools by providing a novel method for discovering sequences that are ranked low yet may be phylogenetically significant in a high-throughput manner. phylometrics makes it possible to explore sequence relationships within a collection in order to quickly build phylogenetically meaningful trees. using a visual and interactive interface, sequences that may provide key insights into functional or evolutionary relatedness are identified much faster than the current standard manual approach. furthermore, the identification of homologous sequences previous to multiple sequence alignments and tree building significantly reduces computational costs and time by minimizing the inclusion of unrelated sequences. once a dataset has been refined and pertinent sequences have been identified, phylometrics enables one to explore the differences between alignments and each method of tree inference to determine which set of methods and parameters may suit the data best. the parameters used in each of the processes are also permanently stored, allowing one to replicate the results manually. results can be exported from any stage in the pipeline for personal collection databases or to be further analyzed in other popular sequence analysis packages, such as arb. the formats of the output include: phylip for alignments, newick for tree inferences and jpg and svg formats for tree visualizations. the multiple sequence alignments are especially useful for export, as manually aligning sequences may be necessary to improve the quality of the resulting tree. the visual representations are also printable from within the flash movie by accessing the menu with a right-click.  phylometrics offers an automated, high-throughput pipeline for phylogenetic inferences in a simple wizard-style web interface, requiring basic computer skills and no user programming experience. it incorporates novel analytical tools to mine sequence collections for biologically significant associations generating trees that provide insights into their respective functional or evolutionary implications. availability and requirements project name: phylometrics project home page: http://www.phylometrics.com operating

"," comparative sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene is frequently used to characterize the microbial diversity of environmental samples. however, sequence similarities do not always imply functional or evolutionary relatedness due to many factors, including unequal rates of change and convergence. thus, relying on top blastn hits for phylogenetic studies may misrepresent the diversity of these constituents. furthermore, attempts to circumvent this issue by including a large number of blastn hits per sequence in one tree to explore their relatedness presents other problems. for instance, the multiple sequence alignment will be poor and computationally costly if not relying on manual alignment, and it may be difficult to derive meaningful relationships from the resulting tree. analyzing sequence relationship networks within collective blastn results, however, reveal sequences that are closely related despite low rank.  we have developed a web application, phylometrics, that relies on networks of collective blastn results to facilitate the process of building phylogenetic trees in an automated, high-throughput fashion while offering novel tools to find sequences that are of significant phylogenetic interest with minimal human involvement. the application, which can be installed locally in a laboratory or hosted remotely, utilizes a simple wizard-style format to guide the user through the pipeline without necessitating a background in programming. furthermore, phylometrics implements an independent job queuing system that enables users to continue to use the system while jobs are run with little or no degradation in performance.  phylometrics provides a novel data mining method to screen supplied dna sequences and to identify sequences that are of significant phylogenetic interest using powerful analytical tools. sequences that are identified as being similar to a number of supplied sequences may provide key insights into their functional or evolutionary relatedness. users require the same basic computer skills as for navigating most internet applications. 19- february seventh annual mcbios conference. bioinformatics: systems, biology, informatics and computation jonesboro, ar, usa ",5f4be89d-f40f-4646-b89a-785dd3550ad5,pubmed
168," dna copy number variations occur within populations and aberrations can cause tumors, be used for drug target identification, and be used as biomarkers of tumor drug response. egfr amplification, for instance, is a marker for gefitinib treatment and tyms amplification conveys 5-fluorouracil resistance in colon tumors. the next-generation sequence enables generation of millions of short sequence tags in a single experiment. using dna as an input, the technology has been used to resequence entire genomes, including from normal individuals and from cancerous cells, and to resequence targeted genomic regions, such as resequencing protein coding regions to discover somatic mutations. alternatively, using rna as an input, the technology has been used to profile rna expression levels, where the number of sequence reads ""tagging"" an rna transcript is a measure of its expression. combining these ideas and building on previous methods, this report describes the development of a sequencing-based platform to profile ""expression"" of dna, inputting dna and analyzing the resultant data using algorithms previously established for gene expression profiling. the platform resolution and cost are tunable; is lab automatable; can be used for both discovery of novel and profiling of known dna copy number variations; outputs copy number and uncertainty as opposed to ratios; and can be used to profile mitochondria and telomeric dna.  application 1: assaying nuclear genomic copy number we assayed the genomic copy number in a pool of dna derived from blood from non-diseased males; a pool of dna derived from blood from non-diseased females; and dna from umc- cells, a lung carcinoid-derived cell line. we generated and sequenced each library, aligned resultant reads to the genome, and selected reads aligning to only one genomic location. across chromosome the number of reads from the male pool mapping to each genomic block is near. from the female pool, the number of reads mapping to each block is similarly constant, at roughly. we tested normalization by the gc content in each dna block; however, we found that the relative number of reads mapping to a block depended more strongly on molecular biology protocols. instead, we developed and applied a novel normalization method using the male pool as a reference, and with this normalization were able to derive the copy number, upper and lower bounds, and the significance of any deviation. in the female dna pool, the copy number is two across the entire chromosome, with a single exception at position ~ mb. use of a single reference sample, processed using the same bench protocol as used for the non-reference samples, therefore eliminates the need to normalize for gc content and for sequence uniqueness within each block. conversely, umc- cells show dramatic copy number variations. before normalization, the number of reads mapping to each block shows many discrete levels, including blocks with no reads and blocks with roughly and reads. after normalization, these discrete levels map to copy number of zero, one, two, three, and four. intriguingly, the homozygously deleted region spanning from to mb includes the putative tumor suppressor cdkn2a. across chromosome the female pool has copy number two across the entire chromosome, as expected. the umc- cell line is highly aberrant: copy number starts at three; is amplified to 9; falls to three; is amplified up to copies; drops to three; falls to two; has a small segment at three copies; back to two; and then back to three. again intriguingly, the highly amplified region includes the tumor-associated gene kras. this assay provides a genome-wide view of copy number in a single assay, allowing the full extent of copy number within a sample to be assessed. while chromosomes and x in umc- cells show little disruption, many chromosomes show amazing copy number variation. almost mb of chromosome is present at copies. an mb block of chromosome is present at one copy. many changes in copy number occur close to or across centromeres. we also identify that the cell line is derived from a male patient as chromosome x is present at one copy and many reads map to chromosome y. to validate findings, we assayed copy number with qpcr at locations. the five locations predicted to have copy number two by sequencing indeed had copy number two as measured by qpcr. copy number measurements of and also validated. at high copy number, sequencing and qpcr measurements were similar: and 11; and 24; and respectively. these results also show high correspondence with findings from an array-based platform, including the chromosome deletion near mb and the small amplification near position mb. results from the highly amplified region of chromosome qualitatively agree; however, the array-based method predicts only copy number in the region where the sequencing and qpcr assays measure over copy number. across the entire genome, the array-based data for umc- cells, downloaded from the sanger center and analyzed with the picnic algorithm, show high concordance at copy number five and below, but discrepancies at higher copy number. the array-platform returns lower copy numbers than found by qpcr and sequencing, potentially the result of microarray probe saturation. values are rounded to the nearest integer. application 2: assaying genetic loci copy number conceptually, one can define biological elements in terms of gene loci rather than genomic blocks, and thus, by counting the number of reads uniquely mapping to each locus, generate a gene-copy number table. here, we defined locus coordinates as the greater of the transcript start-to-stop span or kb centered on the loci. as before, we normalized the counts to the reference male pool, assuming the male pool is diploid across autosomes and haploid across allosomes. the loci with the most significant p-values for higher copy number in the female pool are, not surprisingly, found on chromosome x. in each case, this platform assayed the loci at copy number two in the female pool and one in the male pool and umc- cells. the loci with the most significant lower copy number in umc- cells are in the chromosome deletion, where the loci show copy number two in the female pool. the loci with the most significant amplifications are in the chromosome amplification, with copy number at almost similarly, biological elements can be defined in terms of the coordinates of known dna copy number polymorphisms. by counting reads aligning within the coordinates of each established polymorphism, one can monitor population-variable copy number polymorphisms. application 3: mitochondrial copy number biological elements can also be defined as the mitochondrial dna, in which case one assays the number of mitochondria in the cells. while the counts of mtdna within each individual cell will vary, blood-derived cells on average contain fewer mitochondria relative to cell lines. from the aligned sequence reads, we counted and normalized the number of reads aligning to mtdna as a measure of the average mtdna levels within each sample. indeed, we found that the umc- cells contain over times more mitochondria than the blood-derived male and female pools. application 4: telomere copy number finally, another fascinating biological element that can be interrogated is telomeric sequence. telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes; are on average shorter in cells that have undergone many divisions, such as older cells, tumors, and cell lines; and comprise repetitive ttaggg motifs. we counted and normalized the number of sequence reads containing strikingly, the umc- cells do contain significantly fewer telomere-associated reads than either the female or male pools. discussion and  assaying dna copy number by next-generation sequencing is robust and accurate. the method described here requires a simple genomic dna library construction; returns integer copy number values for homogeneous cells; and has a large dynamic range. the platform is unbiased in the sense that genomic targets are not preselected, such as is the case with qpcr and microarrays, and thus, given a new genome assembly, a new set of copy number polymorphisms, or a new set of biological dna elements, the sequence reads maintain utility through re-alignment. our research builds on previous efforts. the'digital karyotyping' protocol uses restriction enzymes and sage sequencing technology to generate reads that have been used to measure copy number variation and detect infectious viral dna. using illumina deep-sequencing, fetal aneuploidy was assayed, identifying down, edward, and patau syndromes based on chromosome-specific trisomy. illumina deep-sequencing has been used to examine copy number across nuclear chromosomes. campbell et al used paired-end reads from size-selected libraries to identify genomic structural rearrangements and, integrating estimates of copy number with paired-end reads mapping to distal locations, were able to identify breakpoint coordinates and novel dna sutures. recently, chiang et al sequenced a size-selected library and measured the log-ratio change between normal and tumor sample pairs across nuclear chromosomes. they elegantly show trade-off curves between read number, copy number change, and genomic resolution and show statistical determination of breakpoints. in comparing their results to array-based methods, they find the sequencing-based platform has a larger dynamic range. yoon et al. and alkan et al. developed similar methods for use in human resequencing projects, using over billion reads and 30× genome coverage to identify copy number polymorphisms in disease-free cells. the method described here expands on these groundbreaking studies in several ways. first, our library construction does not include a size selection and is thus lab automatable. second, by using a single diploid reference sample along with a novel normalization algorithm, our method removes biases inherent in molecular biology protocols and outputs absolute copy number in addition to log-ratio values. third, we defined an uncertainty that allows us to estimate upper and lower bounds and p-values for each copy number measurement, both for absolute and relative measurements. forth, by defining biological elements as not only nuclear dna blocks positioned evenly across the nuclear genome, this platform enables assaying other biologically meaningful dna elements, including gene loci, known copy number polymorphisms, mitochondria, and telomeres. finally, these results were generated using an illumina genome analyzer ii instrument in june, with one sample per lane, resulting in only to million nt reads per sample. sequencing instrumentation continues to improve, allowing more reads at lower costs. as the resolution of this assay is inversely proportional to the number of aligned reads, sample multiplexing and increasing numbers of sequence reads will enable increased resolution and/or significantly decreased costs. "," dna copy number variations occur within populations and aberrations can cause disease. we sought to develop an improved lab-automatable, cost-efficient, accurate platform to profile dna copy number.  we developed a sequencing-based assay of nuclear, mitochondrial, and telomeric dna copy number that draws on the unbiased nature of next-generation sequencing and incorporates techniques developed for rna expression profiling. to demonstrate this platform, we assayed umc- cells using million nt reads and found tremendous copy number variation, including regions of single and homogeneous deletions and amplifications to copies; times more mitochondria and times less telomeric sequence than a pool of non-diseased, blood-derived dna; and that umc- was derived from a male individual.  the described assay outputs absolute copy number, outputs an error estimate, and is more accurate than array-based platforms at high copy number. the platform enables profiling of mitochondrial levels and telomeric length. the assay is lab-automatable and has a genomic resolution and cost that are tunable based on the number of sequence reads.

advances in arterial spin labelling techniques allow the practical acquisition of cbf estimates with wide spatial coverage of the brain using multi-slice or 3d acquisitions. this has made of asl a very promising technique for the systematic investigation of the physiology and functional determinants of brain perfusion, and of individual differences in baseline cbf at rest. several studies have described the spectral components of time series in asl data. this study is concerned with the spatial patterns of covariation in the residual images of linear models fitted to quantitative perfusion images obtained with the continuous arterial spin labelling technique, as implemented by. a previous study investigated the principal components associated to subject-to-subject spatial variance, and described acquisition-to-acquisition variance. study of spatial covariation is of interest for two reasons. firstly, it gives insight on the interplay of brain physiology with respect of vascularisation, and the signal acquired with this imaging technique. secondly, knowledge of spatial covariation is important to experimenters because it constitutes a violation of the stationarity assumption on the random field that models spatial covariation of residuals after smoothing. under this assumption, residuals are spatially distributed like smoothed white noise. concretely, the violation of this assumption means that under the null hypothesis the estimated effects are likely to reflect the pattern determined by the most important patterns of covariation, rather than a random set of blobs scattered across the brain. therefore, when inspecting images of the estimated effects, knowledge of the form these images are likely to take even if the null hypothesis is true can assist in evaluating the spatial patterns produced by an experiment or an observational study, and distinguishing between sources of variation due to vascularisation and those due to the variable of interest. here, we refer to acquisitions as to images of cbf values computed from applying a compartment model to two scans, one with and one without labelled spins. in a study of baseline perfusion at rest, acquisition-to-acquisition variance arises from variation from one estimated perfusion image to the other within subjects. in a study in which participants carry out a task in the scanner, acquisition-to-acquisition variance is constituted by the residual variance arising from one estimated perfusion image to the other within experimental conditions/factor levels. figure displays maps of acquisition-to-acquisition variance, collected from participants resting quietly in the scanner with closed eyes for min, and therefore originated from a study of the first type. one can see that this variance shows differences of one order of magnitude across the brain, and that these differences follow anatomical features such as the course of large vessels. high variance also occurs at the edges of the brain and in ventricles, where the model used to estimate perfusion may not hold. because the reasons for high variance in these areas and near large vessels may differ, it is conceivable that spatial covariance may show different intensities depending on the mechanism at the basis of variance. specifically, we would expect high variance at the edges of the brain to arise because of high variation from one voxel to the next leading to low spatial covariance, while near large vessels groups of voxels may tend to assume largely different values from one acquisition to the other, giving rise to larger spatial correlations. in this study, patterns of spatial covariation will be identified by carrying out a principal component analysis of the estimated acquisition-to-acquisition variance shown in figure the sample consists of a total of images collected from participants, and because of its size should yield a quite reliable eigendecomposition. to characterize the origin of these components further, the relation of the main components of variation with global cbf levels will be investigated.  principal component analysis the first component explained about 10% of the variance, and contained variation shared by all voxels, shown by the coefficients of the component being of the same sign over the whole volume. this mode of variation was determined by the perfusion level of the acquisition in the whole volume, as is shown by the high correlation of the score of this component with global cbf values. areas of high acquisition-to-acquisition variance, visible in figure were represented in the spatial pattern of this component, which loaded with different intensity depending on overall acquisition-to-acquisition variance. taken together, the evidence presented in these figures shows that when global cbf of the acquisition is high, the computed regional cbf at the large vessels is even higher than the average level; furthermore, also perfusion in the cortex increases more than in the white matter. however, the variation of the first component appears to affect the calcarine and medial occipital cortex more than other cortical areas and as anticipated by their vicinity to large vessels. furthermore, the high variance at the edges of the brain and in ventricles of figure is underrepresented. outside the brain parenchyma, high spatial covariation is observed in the space between the hemispheres and in the sylvian scissure. the second and third components, each accounting for about 5% of the variance, captured variation located along the course of main vessels. the dissociation between anterior and posterior areas visible in the comparison between these two components reflects the main subdivision of branches stemming from the internal carotids and the vertebral artery. the fourth component, accounting for about % of the overall variance, reflected dissociation between the brain parenchyma as a whole and the high-variance edges. in these components, association with global cbf was negligible, in contrast to the first component. no component up to the 10th was noted to reflect right-left asymmetries in perfusion. discussion in this study, the pattern of spatial covariation in the acquisition-to-acquisition variance in casl images was investigated using principal component analysis in a large sample of images. the results obtained here reflect the effectiveness and accuracy with which this technique could be implemented in our laboratory, and are certainly of limited generalizability to future techniques that may seek a more accurate estimation of cbf. however, the casl imaging protocol implemented here represents a pragmatic approach to cbf estimation, and its adoption may be informed by the results presented here. the first component of variation captured changes in the overall intensity of the quantitative cbf estimate in each acquisition. these changes affected gray more than white matter and large vessel areas more than the rest of the brain parenchyma. an important aspect of this component of variation is its high correlation with global perfusion levels. even if the spatial pattern of covariance is somewhat different, this component is in this respect analogous to the first component obtained by the principal component analysis of subject-to-subject variance, which also captures changes of global perfusion levels. the finding that the first component is associated with global perfusion levels in both subject-to-subject and acquisition-to-acquisition sources of variance suggests that many factors, now affecting variation between subjects, now affecting variation between acquisitions, may have a common effect on global perfusion levels. what one then sees is that differences in global perfusion levels affect brain regions with distinct but characteristic spatial patterns, depending on whether these factors have acted between acquisitions or between subjects. this observation is relevant for the application of procedures that, with the aim of reducing this source of variance and increase testing power, correct for global cbf values. the second and third components reflected a vascular factor, consistent with the predominant dissociation between the anterior and posterior regions due to the two main sources of arterial supply, internal carotids and cerebral artery. this source of variation may ensue from labeled spins that have not yet reached the capillary bed, or from interactions between the timing of the labeling pulse and the rhythm of blood flow. these components reflect the interplay of brain physiology, specifically of large vessels, and the signal acquired with this imaging technique. in contrast, variation at the edges of the brain is underrepresented in covariance patterns, loading strongly only on the fourth component. this is consistent with the observation of the noisy character of the data at the brain edges. the relative importance of the first three components, accounting together for over 20% of the total variance, shows that residual variation across voxels in this type of images is affected by important violations of the stationarity assumption on the gaussian random field modeling residual variation. furthermore, the spatial pattern of these components follows anatomical boundaries, such as the anterior and medial temporal lobe, the medial occipital and calcarine cortex, the insula, and the subgenual portion of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex. when averaging these images, some combination of these patterns, apparently following anatomical structures, may arise just by chance, as was demonstrated in the case studies. the anteromedial part of the temporal lobe and the lower half of the medial aspect of the brain hemispheres appear to be particularly affected. note also that the apparently homogenous high variance of the medial aspect of the brain hemispheres visible in the sagittal slice of figure is in fact produced by the superposition of spatially characterized patterns.  using principal component analysis, we investigated the patterns of spatial covariation arising from changes in the global estimated perfusion levels and their interplay with vascular anatomy. "," images of perfusion estimates obtained with the continuous arterial spin labelling technique are characterized by variation between single acquisitions. little is known about the spatial determinants of this variation during the acquisition process and their impact on voxel-by-voxel estimates of effects.  we show here that the spatial patterns of covariance between voxels arising during the acquisition of these images uncover distinct mechanisms through which this variance arises: through variation in global perfusion levels; through the action of large vessels and other, less well characterized, large anatomical structures; and through the effect of noisy areas such as the edges of the brain.  knowledge of these covariance patterns is important to experimenters for a correct interpretation of findings, especially for studies where relatively few acquisitions are made.

170," the ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion family consists of two members, caps1/cadps and caps2/cadps. caps was shown to play a role in the atp-dependent priming step of ca2+-triggered dense-core vesicle exocytosis by binding to both phosphatidyl inositol -bisphosphate and dcvs in response to ca2+ increase; it also interacts with the dopamine receptor. a study of caps1-deficient mice suggested that caps is involved in catecholamine loading of dcvs in embryonic chromaffin cells. on the other hand, caps is associated with secretory vesicles containing the neurotrophins bdnf and nt- in the parallel fiber terminals of cerebellar granule cells, and is involved in the release of bdnf and nt-. caps is widely localized across various brain regions, and shows overlapping distribution patterns with bdnf in many areas. our recent studies of caps2-deficient mice indicated that caps plays pivotal roles in bdnf release, cellular phenotypes, and behavioral phenotypes. the expression of an aberrant splicing variant of caps in some patients with autism has also been reported. the autistic isoform, caps2Δexon is missing exon which encodes the dynactin 1-interacting domain. exogenously expressed caps2Δexon failed to localize to axons but accumulated in somato-dendritic areas in cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons, suggesting a possible disturbance of local caps2-mediated neurotrophin release. in this study, we further explore splicing variations in caps and identified five additional splice isoforms. we characterized the expression patterns and neurotrophin release properties of these isoforms.  using cdna probes comprising the sequence of both exons and of caps we screened a p mouse cerebellar cdna library for splicing variants of caps in addition to the original clone designated caps2a, which was identical to the one that we previously reported, we isolated five additional variants, probably derived from full-length transcripts, designated caps2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, and 2f. sequence analyses against genome databases showed that these sequences could be produced by the different usage of the exons of the caps gene. all splicing acceptor and donor sequences of these clones were consistent with the ag/gt rule. the full-length caps protein consists of the following functional domains, as shown in figure 2: a dynactin 1-interacting domain, a c domain, a pleckstrin homology domain and a munc13-1-homologous domain. caps2b lacks only exon which encodes a part of the mhd. caps2a lacks two exons, and which encode part of the mhd sequence. caps2c lacks two exons, exon encoding a c-terminal part of the ph domain, and exon in contrast to these three long isoforms, caps2d, 2e and 2f have large c-terminal large truncations from exon and respectively; thus, these isoforms have neither the mhd nor the c-tail domain, which mediates the association of caps with dcvs. these three short isoforms have an additional unique exon at their 3' end. the shortest isoform, caps2f, has only the first four authentic exons and none of the functional domains identified so far. all isoforms have exon which contains the domain interacting with p150glued. the mouse caps exon coding sequence is identical to the human caps exon coding sequence, which is absent in some autistic patients. as shown in figure 3a, no exon skipping was observed during the development of the cerebellum, from e to p provided there were sufficient pcr cycles. moreover, no exon skipping was observed in whole brain, thymus, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, or testis from p or p mice. these results suggest that exon skipping does not normally occur in mouse caps we examined the patterns of caps splicing during cerebellar development, by rt-pcr using specific primer sets for each isoform. caps2b is the only isoform that contains exon therefore, rt-pcr with a primer pair spanning exon 21-exon resulted in a longer band for caps2b in addition to a shorter band for caps2a and 2c. interestingly, there was a peak in the expression of caps2a and/or 2c at p whereas caps2b was up-regulated throughout development. the expression of caps2d reached a peak at p and decreased thereafter, whereas that of both caps2e and 2f reached a peak between p and p among the eight mouse tissues tested, the brain, lung, kidney, and testis showed expression of all isoforms except for caps2b. interestingly, expression of caps2b was detectable only in the brain. among these isoforms, the expression level of caps2f was the lowest as shown by its requiring the highest cycle number of pcr cycles to detect it. we next examined the cellular distribution of caps isoform mrnas in p and p mouse brains by in situ hybridization analyses. exon which contains a part of the ph-domain coding sequence, is skipped in caps2c, but is included in caps2a, 2b, 2d, and 2e. the probe for exon showed expression in the hippocampal formation, neocortex, midbrain, and cerebellar granule cells. exon which contains a part of the mhd coding sequence, is skipped in caps2a and 2c, but is included in caps2b. the probe for exon showed an expression pattern with the most prominent level in cerebellar granule cells. expression of caps2d, 2e and 2f was also observed mainly in cerebellar granule cells. moreover, there was no apparent difference in the expression patterns of these isoforms in the p cerebellar cortex, as shown in figure 4k. caps family proteins are essentially soluble proteins, but a fraction of them is capable of being associated with membrane. therefore, we next examined the subcellular fractionation patterns of these splicing variant proteins, exogenously expressed in pc cells. all isoforms were stably expressed in transfected pc cells. caps isoforms containing an intact ph domain were recovered from the membrane fraction, although a major portion of each isoform was included in the soluble fraction. on the other hand, caps isoforms lacking a part of the ph domain or the entire ph domain were not detectable in the membrane fraction, suggesting that the ph domain has a role in the membrane association of caps protein, as previously shown. we next examined the expression of the endogenous proteins produced from these splice isoform mrnas in the mouse brain. immunoreactive bands corresponding to short isoforms were observed at low to undetectable protein levels in the mouse cerebellum. in addition, the previous report showed that in non-neural tissue such as pituitary, lung, pancreas and kidney, only a kda band immunoreactive for caps was detected. at the mrna level, more reaction cycles and time were needed for the amplification of transcripts encoding the short isoforms by rt-pcr and for the colorimetric detection of transcripts by in situ hybridization, respectively, indicating that the expression levels of the genes encoding the short isoforms are very low. these results indicate that the function of caps in vivo is apparently due to the long isoforms rather than the short isoforms. however, the functional role of the short isoforms remain to be studied. to analyze functional differences between splicing variants, we carried out a bdnf secretion assay. to investigate the effect of these isoforms on bdnf releasing activity, we exogenously expressed the three long isoforms together with bdnf in pc cells. short isoforms were not analyzed because of their large c-terminal truncation and very low expression levels in mouse brain. as shown in figure the levels of bdnf released into the culture medium in response to high-kcl stimulation were increased approximately two-fold by the expression of caps2a or 2b compared with cells without exogenous caps expression. caps2c-expressing cells showed lower bdnf-releasing activity than caps2a- or 2b-expressing cells; however, caps2c-expressing cells also showed an increase in bdnf release in response to high-kcl stimulation. moreover, there was no significant difference in basal bdnf release between caps2c-expressing cells and cells expressing either of the other two isoforms. there was a partial deletion of the ph domain in caps2c. the partial ph domain of plc-gamma is known to interact with a complementary partial ph-like domain of another protein and elicit its function. therefore, it is possible that caps2c has some bdnf-releasing activity, although its activity is lower than that of intact ph domain-containing isoforms. interestingly, expression of the exon 22-containing isoform was up-regulated in the developing mouse cerebellum, whereas exon 22-skipped isoforms were expressed transiently, peaking at p moreover, the exon 22-containing isoform showed higher bdnf-releasing activity than other long isoforms. on the other hand, as described in our previous report, caps immunoreactivities are detected in both the soma and axon of cerebellar granule cells at p but almost exclusively in the axon at p. these results suggest that the exon splicing patterns are related to high releasing activity and axonal localization in cerebellar granule cells. caps2-mediated regulation of neurotrophin actions in terms of their releasing dose and subcellular localization may be important for normal cerebellar development. the splicing of exon is interesting for reasons other than the developmental differences in expression; that is, the exon 22-containing isoform was detectable only in the brain, whereas exon 22-skipped isoforms were widely expressed in various tissues. exon encodes part of the mhd, specifically a proline-rich domain. proline-rich motifs occurred often in many protein-protein interaction sites, including one recognized by the src homology domain. our preliminary screening of protein candidates that interact with the exon 22-encoded region, by yeast two-hybrid, isolated five candidates; however, none of these had an sh domain. future analyses of caps proline-rich domain-interacting proteins will clarify the significance of the alternative splicing of exon  we explored the alternative splicing diversity of caps and identified six caps isoforms. the alternative splicing of exon was associated with a difference in tissue distribution and a developmental expression pattern. our study showed that an intact ph domain is required for the association of caps with the membrane and efficient bdnf release activity. on the other hand, exon 3-skipping, found in autistic patients, was not observed in the mouse tissues tested. "," ca2+-dependent activator protein is a secretory vesicle-associated protein involved in the release of neurotrophin. we recently reported that an aberrant, alternatively spliced caps mrna that lacks exon is detected in some patients with autism. splicing variations in mouse caps and their expression and functions remain unclear.  in this study, we defined exons in the mouse caps gene and identified six alternative splicing variants, caps2a-f. caps2a is an isoform lacking exons and which encode part of the munc13-1-homologous domain. caps2b lacks exon caps2c lacks exons and caps2d, 2e, and 2f have c-terminal deletions from exon exon and exon respectively. on the other hand, a mouse counterpart of caps2Δexon was not detected in the mouse tissues tested. caps2b was expressed exclusively in the brain, and the other isoforms were highly expressed in the brain, but also in some non-neural tissues. in the brain, all isoforms showed predominant expression patterns in the cerebellum. in the developing cerebellum, caps2b showed an up-regulated expression pattern, whereas the other isoforms exhibited transiently peaked expression patterns. caps proteins were mostly recovered in soluble fractions, but some were present in membrane fractions, except for caps2c and 2f, both of which lack the ph domain, suggesting that the ph domain is important for membrane association. in contrast to caps2a and 2b, caps2c showed slightly decreased bdnf-releasing activity, which is likely due to the c-terminal truncation of the ph domain in caps2c.  this study indicates that, in mouse, there are six splicing variants of caps, and that these are subdivided into two groups: a long form containing the c-terminal mhd and a short form lacking the c-terminal mhd. these results demonstrate that the splicing variations correlate with their expression patterns and intracellular distribution, and affect bdnf release; however, whether or not the short forms possess activities other than bdnf release, for example as natural dominant-negative isoforms, remains to be determined.

171," postpartum endometritis in cattle is a multifactorial disease with high economic impact. inflammation of the bovine uterus has been demonstrated to decrease reproductive performance. both, clinical and subclinical endometritis were associated with increased days to first service as well as decreased conception and pregnancy rates resulting in an increased risk of culling. bacteriological contaminations of the uterus after parturition and metabolic changes in the transition period are important etiological factors. negative energy balance, is known to influence the number and functional properties of polymorphonuclear cells. there is evidence that periparturient depression of functional properties and number of pmn is of great importance for the pathogenesis of endometritis, as recently reviewed. the identification of risk factors for endometritis will contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of endometritis. an early identification of cows at risk for endometritis could provide new targets for intervention and the basis for changes in management practices to prevent this disease. decreased dry matter intake prior to parturition is associated with mobilization of lipids, which are released as non-esterified fatty acids from adipose tissue. decreased dmi and increased nefa levels are associated with periparturient suppression of the immune function, resulting in a greater susceptibility of cows to infection. cows with clinical or subclinical ketosis have shown impaired phagocytic activity of pmn isolated from milk and blood. elevated serum bhba concentrations in the first two weeks postpartum were indicative of an increased risk of metritis, a common pre-stage for ce and sce, and decreased pregnancy risk. a reduction of probability of pregnancy of to 50% was found, depending on the magnitude and duration of elevated serum bhba. a relationship between the plasma concentration of bilirubin and the respiratory burst activity of bovine pmn in vitro was found. it was hypothesized by the authors that bilirubin has potential as a diagnostic marker of impaired neutrophil function and consequently for identification of cows at risk around parturition. furthermore, elevated urea concentrations had an effect of decreasing uterine ph during the luteal phase. bovine endometrial cells in culture responded directly to increasing urea concentrations with alteration in ph gradient. this effect might facilitate subsequent bacterial growth and lower local immune defense. few publications are available describing relationships between metabolic disorders and the prevalence of ce and sce under field conditions. hammon et al. reported significantly elevated concentrations of nefa and bhba around parturition for cows with ce and sce compared with healthy cows. decreased pmn function and elevated plasma levels of nefa prior to parturition and elevated plasma levels of bhba postpartum were associated with uterine disorders later in lactation. however, predictor cut points have not been determined yet. the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between elevated serum concentrations of nefa, bhba, bilirubin and urea in the periparturient period and the prevalence of ce and sce. specifically, we set out to determine sensitivity and specificity of these metabolic parameters for the detection of ce and sce, establishing optimal predictor cut points for daily practical use.  prevalence of endometritis overall prevalence of ce and sce was % and %, respectively. prevalence of ce and sce at wk + in pp cows was % and %, respectively and in mp cows % and %, respectively. primiparous cows serum concentrations of urea at wk + differed between health categories. all other metabolic parameters did not differ between health categories in pp cows. binary logistic regression revealed that in pp cows, higher concentrations of urea at wk + were associated with increased odds of ce at wk +. an optimal predictor cut point of mmol/l was determined. only combinations were a difference between median values for nefa, bhba, bilirubin and urea in the health categories was found by kruskal-wallis-h-test are shown. a relative to calving in weeks b health category: healthy, clinical endometritis and subclinical endometritis c odds ratios are based on the continuous variables of the logistic regression models with an mmol/l increase of metabolites as units. multiparous cows serum concentrations of nefa at wk - and wk + and of urea at wk + differed between health categories. all other metabolic parameters did not differ between health categories in mp cows. higher concentrations of nefa at wk - were associated with increased odds of ce and sce at wk + compared with healthy cows. an optimal predictor cut point of mmol/l for the discrimination between healthy and ce cows and healthy and sce cows was determined. higher concentrations of urea at wk + were associated with decreased odds of ce compared with healthy and sce cows. an optimal predictor cut point of mmol/l for the discrimination between healthy and ce cows was determined. for the discrimination between sce and ce cows an optimal predictor cut point of mmol/l was determined. discussion previous studies demonstrated negative impacts of elevated concentrations of nefa, bhba, bilirubin, and urea on pmn function, uterine environment and the prevalence of metritis. these findings led to our hypothesis that elevated concentrations of these metabolic parameters might serve as indicators for the presence of endometritis. differences between pp and mp cows in the regulation of fat tissue mobilization and the dmi around parturition have been described. therefore, in our study metabolic profiles were analyzed separately for mp and pp cows. in mp cows, nefa concentrations measured at wk - were a significant predictor for cows at higher risk of ce or sce with lower concentrations in healthy cows. sensitivities were low, but specificities were fairly high. yet, our data generated in the field support evidence from earlier in vitro studies showing that high concentrations of nefa can affect functions of bovine blood pmn. also this study confirms previous findings on an association between energy status prior to calving and uterine health in the postpartum dairy cow utilizing a different diagnostic technique for sce that has been described as more reliable than the uterine lavage. to our knowledge this is the first study to describe an exact predictor cut point for nefa to discriminate between healthy and diseased cows. elevated concentrations of bhba and other ketone bodies have been shown to impair the proliferation of bone marrow cells, the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro, the in vitro chemotactic differentials of leukocytes and the respiratory burst activity of pmn in cattle. field studies found elevated concentrations of bhba during early lactation in cows with ce and sce compared to healthy cows and elevated bhba concentrations in the first week postpartum indicative of an increased risk of subsequent metritis. surprisingly, our data do not confirm the diagnostic value of bhba concentrations to predict endometritis. differences in experimental designs, methodologies and disease definitions might have contributed to this discrepancy. in the field studies cited metritis or endometritis was diagnosed earlier in lactation than in the current study. furthermore, sce was diagnosed by uterine lavage and a higher threshold of pmn was used. alterations of uterine ph caused by elevated concentrations of urea have been demonstrated to affect the viability of embryos. this study investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of urea and uterine health. multiparous cows with ce had lower plasma concentrations of urea at wk + this could be explained by a possible lower feed intake of cows with ce. a recent study showed that cows with uterine disease occurring in the weeks postpartum consumed less dry matter during the transition period compared to healthy cows. huzzey et al., however, diagnosed metritis, not endometritis, so criteria for uterine disease were not similar to the present study. also, it is not clear whether the reduction in dmi is the reason for uterine disease or a consequence. information concerning the effect of a lower urea concentration, as found in cows with ce in this study, on the uterine environment or on pmn function is to our knowledge not available. on the other side, pp cows with ce had higher serum concentrations of urea at wk + we can only speculate about the reason for the opposing results concerning urea concentrations in pp and mp cows with ce in this study. in cows with a ruminal flora not adapted to lactational rations, the dietary protein supply exceeds the energy availability in the bovine rumen, which results in higher urea concentrations. it is possible that in our study pp cows faced a more abrupt diet transition than mp cows due to the change in ration. but our study does not provide sufficient data to prove this hypothesis. the body condition score is used to appraise body fat in dairy cattle. the change in bcs is an indirect measurement of the fat metabolism and thereby related to the tested metabolic parameters, particularly nefa and bhba. measurement of the chosen metabolites, however, is more objective, repeatable, and subtle than the bcs. furthermore, the parameters offer information about the actual differences between cows. therefore, bsc was not included in the study. we are aware, however, that the inclusion of the bcs could have added another semi-quantifiable factor of potential influence on ce and sce. for the determination of the optimal predictor cut points the statistical software medcalc utilizes the youden's index. the index balances sensitivity and specificity equally. it is important to note that depending on the goals of diagnosing cows with ce or sce one could use a different approach such as choosing a threshold based on high sensitivity or high specificity.  the combinations of sensitivity and specificity for the predictors cut points determined in this study were low and unsatisfactory for practical use. therefore, the serum concentrations of nefa, bhba, bilirubin or urea at wk - wk + or wk+ relative to calving are unsatisfactory for disease prediction. this study was designed as a first approach to establish predictor cut points for daily practical use. further research, with tighter sampling intervals around parturition, measurement of body weight, and monitoring of actual dmi, is required to better describe factors that contribute to the risk of postpartum uterine disease. "," postpartum endometritis in cattle is a multifactorial disease with high economic impact. both, clinical endometritis and subclinical endometritis result in decreased reproductive performance. results from in vitro studies led to the implication that non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, bilirubin, and urea could be used as predictors for endometritis in veterinary practice. in this field study, we set out to establish optimal predictor cut points of these metabolic parameters for the detection of ce and sce. serum samples were collected one week prior to parturition, in the first week postpartum and between and days postpartum from holstein-friesian cows. at wk + all cows were examined for signs of ce and sce.  higher concentrations of urea at wk + were associated with increased odds of ce in primiparous cows. a predictor cut point of mmol/l was determined. in multiparous cows, the logistic regression model revealed that higher concentrations of nefa at wk - were associated with increased odds of ce and sce. a predictor cut point of mmol/l was determined. increasing concentrations of urea at wk + were associated with decreased odds of ce. a predictor cut point of mmol/l was determined. for bhba and bilirubin relationships with ce or sce were not detected.  the corresponding combinations of sensitivity and specificity of the determined predictor cut points were not satisfactory for practical use. thus, the analysed parameters, i.e. nefa, bhba, bilirubin, and urea, at the chosen time points, i.e. at wk - at wk + and at wk + relative to calving, are unsatisfactory for disease prediction. further research is required to clarify the questions raised by the current study.

172," haplotypes can give useful information about patterns of inheritance for genomic regions. for each region, the probability of sharing founder genes through segregation in a recorded pedigree can be estimated based on the haplotypes, i.e. identity by descent probability based on linkage. the probability of sharing the genes from a common ancestor before the recorded pedigree can also be estimated based on the haplotypes, i.e. ibd probability based on linkage disequilibrium. those probabilities derived from the haplotypes are essential information for linkage mapping and association mapping. since haplotypes would not be directly observed from genotypic data, they need to be inferred based on observed pedigree information and marker genotypes. this would often result in a large state space of possible haplotype configurations especially with general pedigrees and incomplete genotypic data for multiple markers. exact likelihood methods using pedigree peeling, chromosome peeling or a combination of both algorithms often have problems dealing with the large state space and therefore have difficulties in finding the optimal haplotypes. alternatively, combinatorial optimization algorithms can be used. these are able to deal with problems that are hard to solve in polynomial time. one strategy used in such algorithms is to search for haplotype configurations that require a minimum number of recombination events or no recombination events. these approaches are rule-based and do not make any assumptions about genetic distances between markers. another approach is statistically based and would search for haplotype configurations with the highest likelihood, given all observed variables and known marker distances. a widely used statistical approach for haplotype reconstruction is simulated annealing which has been implemented in the linkage software, simwalk. simwalk uses a random walk approach to find candidates and an annealing process to develop the consecutive solutions to reach the optimal haplotypes. simwalk constitutes a flexible and efficient algorithm for haplotyping and probably the only one used for a general complex pedigree with incomplete genotypes. however, it needs a very large number of sequential evaluations and it is not always guaranteed that the most likely solutions are found within the arbitrarily determined number of evaluations. evolutionary algorithms constitute an efficient tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems. a number of parallel solutions are respectively updated by changing the variables within each solution, or recombining them from different solutions, and the most favorable solutions are selected. compared to sa, ea may be competitive in efficiently finding an optimal solution. an important advantage of ea is its potential to parallellise computations because the algorithm can be divided across multiple cpus. this would substantially reduce computing time. moreover, the search mechanism in ea can make it easier to diagnose convergence compared to that in simwalk it is well known that ea can be easily designed and parameterised for a specific problem, and standard values for ea-parameters usually give reasonably good results. in addition, jointly updating the set of dependent variables can increase the computational efficiency although not all sets of dependent variables may be found. it is noted that simwalk attempts to update multiple variables together, but the set that is updated is randomly chosen. because dependent variables are not necessarily within the same set, the acceptance rates are generally low. an evolutionary algorithm has not been implemented before in statistical approaches for haplotyping. the aim of this study is to investigate the use of an evolutionary algorithm and joint updating strategy for haplotyping, and compare its efficiency with simwalk  likelihood pattern with simulated data ‡number of evaluations of the likelihood function, * is from the default annealing schedule of simwalk2 ¶computing time for simwalk ea and ea when using incomplete genotypic data, the likelihood values are not yet converged after evaluations. after evaluations, the likelihood values appear to be fairly close to the global maximum where the value for ea is the highest among the three methods. after, evaluations, the likelihood reaches stable values with apparent convergence where the value for ea is the highest and the value for simwalk is the worst. it is noted that the convergence patterns and the evaluation numbers are different between complete and incomplete genotypes. likelihood pattern with real data ¶computing time for simwalk ea and ea computing time for a fixed number of evaluations with processors the relative computing time between simwalk ea and ea with processors varies depending on data structure. when using simulated data with complete genotypes, the computing time completing, evaluations for ea and ea was times and times faster than simwalk. however, when using simulated data with incomplete genotypes, the relative computing efficiency for ea was decreased; ea was times and ea was times faster than simwalk. when using the real data, the computing time completing, evaluations for ea and ea was times and times faster than simwalk. the larger advantage for ea for a larger data set is probably due to the fact that the proportion of transferring time over whole computing time increases when using a data set of small size with a few genotypes, e.g. simulated data with incomplete genotypes. convergence diagnosis and computational efficiency discussion the ea and ea reach the global or nearly global maximum quicker than simwalk both with simulated and real data. this was probably due to the fact that ea and ea used a number of parallel configurations which apparently is a more efficient searching mechanism, resulting in a wider range of variables updated during the cycles. using an efficient joint updating strategy combined with the random walk, ea significantly outperformed simwalk with a simultaneous use of multiple processors. convergence for ea or simwalk can be assessed by comparison of the likelihood values between different parts to check if the likelihood reaches a stable value. when the likelihood value is not converged, simwalk as currently implemented, requires another complete run with a new annealing schedule which would need to be longer than the previous run. therefore, simwalk may need multiple runs with a large number of evaluations. however, in the ea, the convergence of the likelihood value can be checked at any time and any point during the run without any rescheduling or rerun. for convergence diagnosis shown in figure simwalk needed to run more than times because of rescheduling of the annealing process for each point. however, ea and ea needed only a single run for the same convergence assessment. the ea population size was arbitrarily set at n = the chance of operating ea-recombination or ea-mutation was randomly equal, i.e. the probability of ea-recombination was ~. different ea-parameters did not dramatically affect the results unless the values were extreme, e.g. outside the range – for n or outside the range ~ for the probability of ea-recombination. if there are hundreds of cpus available, then n should not be less than the number of cpus used, to maximize the efficiency of parallel computing. such large values for n for large scale parallel computing should be tested with regard to optimal performance. however, it is possible to set n considerably higher than optimal, and computational efficiency is still increased. in the real data, we used microsatellites on the same chromosome positioned at cm intervals on average. however, a much larger number of markers is expected to be used soon, e.g. thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms at << ~ cm intervals on a single chromosome. the ea with hundreds of cpus may be able to parallelize and solve the increased size of the problem within a reasonable time. haplotypes for dense markers might be resolved using population ld without pedigree information. however, when population ld is not significant over the average marker distance, the methods may perform poorly. therefore, when ld is not sufficient or one may not be sure whether there is enough ld, our approach will be an efficient tool for haplotyping for most types of data. when using multiple cpus and multiple machines, data transfer between machines took a large part of the overall computing time. therefore, the ea was slightly modified in order to save on transfer time. there were n nodes for ea-members parallelised between machines. we made each node have two ea-members. ea-mutation and ea-recombination were carried out in each node, and the solutions were evolved. one set of solutions in each node was moved to the next node every n cycles, therefore a complete evolutionary mechanism was performed with periodic isolation of islands. the number for n was chosen as n = total number of iterations/k, which resulted in k transfers between nodes in an analysis. it is noted that n should be a sufficient number for ea-mutation and ea-recombination within each node, and k should be a sufficient number for communicating between the nodes. in this study, we chose a large number k = which would be sufficient for n as well because we usually used the total number of iterations ≥ number of meiosis × number of markers × such a strategy becomes more important when using many different machines. we used data sets having complex relationships with incomplete genotypes. such data sets are quite common in natural and outbred populations. complex pedigrees with incomplete genotypes will generally generate a too large state space for haplotying, which cannot be handled by exact methods. however, simwalk has been successfully and widely used for such data sets although the size of data should be small or moderate. we showed that our approach could handle such data sets, and the computational efficiency for our approach was much higher than that for simwalk  the difference between ea and sa is mainly determined by the parameters used in their search mechanism, which affect the number of configurations considered in the cycles and updating strategies, and how information from different solutions is used to generate new candidate solutions. the ea algorithm has a substantial advantage in convergence assessment and parallel computing, which would much increase the efficiency of haplotype reconstruction. moreover, with the joint updating scheme, ea significantly outperformed simwalk. with more cpu, the computational efficiency of ea would be increased. in addition, our implementation of ea and ea for this application is likely to leave much room for increased performance, given the wide range of structural and parameterization strategies that could be invoked. further study would be required to investigate such potential. "," haplotype reconstruction is important in linkage mapping and association mapping of quantitative trait loci. one widely used statistical approach for haplotype reconstruction is simulated annealing, implemented in simwalk however, the algorithm needs a very large number of sequential iterations, and it does not clearly show if convergence of the likelihood is obtained.  an evolutionary algorithm is a good alternative whose convergence can be easily assessed during the process. it is feasible to use a powerful parallel-computing strategy with the ea, increasing the computational efficiency. it is shown that the ea can be ~ times faster and gives more reliable estimates than simwalk when using processors. in addition, jointly updating dependent variables can increase the computational efficiency up to ~ times. overall, the proposed method with processors increases the computational efficiency up to ~ times compared to simwalk the efficiency will increase more with a larger number of processors.  the use of the evolutionary algorithm and the joint updating method can be a promising tool for haplotype reconstruction in linkage and association mapping of qtl.

173," natural products are small molecules synthesized by bacteria, algae, fungi and plants, as part of their biotic and abiotic interactions with the environment. they provide a valuable source of pharmaceuticals, with 45% of the most popular drugs derived from natural products. however, the identification of molecular targets for natural compounds with pharmacological activity remains a significant bottleneck in the process of drug validation. plants provide a formidable source of natural products with pharmacological activity. over phytochemicals have already been identified from the small fraction of the plant kingdom that has so far been surveyed. these phytochemicals can be classified into large groups that include the alkaloids, the terpenoids, and the phenylpropanoids. flavonoids, derived from phenylpropanoids, are widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom and are abundantly present in many fruits and leaves. they are characterized by the presence of two benzene rings linked by a pyrane or pyrone ring. based on the position and modifications of the a, b and c rings, the + flavonoids so far known can be classified into several sub-classes including the flavonols, the flavones, the isoflavones and the red/purple anthocyanin pigments. flavonoids are potent antioxidants and have important activities as dietary anti-carcinogens and anti-inflammatory compounds. flavonoids are also significant to plants, serving as signal molecules in various developmental processes. several studies have investigated the effect of flavonoids on the activity of various enzymes. for example, flavonoids possess protein kinase and p-glycoprotein inhibitory activities. however, with a few exceptions, in vivo animal and plant cellular targets for flavonoids are largely unknown. few methods are currently available for identifying proteins that bind to small molecules of plant origin, for example flavonoids. the development of high-throughput methods for the identification of flavonoid-binding proteins could significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which flavonoids modulate plant hormone transport, contribute to plant male fertility, serve as allelochemicals and facilitate the identification of missing metabolic enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. one promising approach is the generation of flavonoid derivatives that contain a benzophenone chromophore for use as a photoaffinity reagent. while benzophenone-modified flavonoids can potentially permit the identification of flavonoid-binding proteins, they are inadequate for the isolation of significant quantities of proteins, necessary for their mass spectrometry identification. the isolation of flavonoid-binding proteins would be simplified by the availability of flavonoids covalently-linked to solid supports that would permit the affinity-purification of flavonoid-binding proteins from complex protein mixtures or protein libraries. few methods are currently available that explore the possibility of linking select flavonoids to solid supports. here, we describe the efficient coupling of the flavanone naringenin, a central intermediate in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, to small ceramic and glass beads. the method developed can be easily adapted for the coupling of other related flavonoids to beads. the naringenin-coupled beads provide a powerful chemical genetic tool to probe biological systems.  ceramic and glass beads provide high-capacity solid supports many beaded solid supports are available, primarily developed towards combinatorial chemistry efforts. the possibility to use small ceramic and hollow glass beads for the conjugation of small molecules was investigated here, because of their low cost, reduced size and compatibility with most organic and inorganic solvents. scanning electron microscopy experiments showed that the ceramic beads have an average particle volume of μm and a diameter of approximately μm, about times smaller than the glass beads. these dimensions make them much smaller than the usual solid supports utilized in solid phase synthesis. the sem analyses also confirmed that both the ceramic and glass beads are not porous. this is an important property to consider given the ultimate goal to use the beads to identify proteins that bind to the small molecule, which requires a minimal hindrance of the small molecule by the bead matrix. the presence of si-oh groups on the surface of the beads allows the rapid conjugation of bifunctional organosilanes. to investigate the capacity of the loading of functional groups onto the surface of the ceramic and glass beads, silanisation of the beads was performed using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. after washing and drying completely, the amino-modified beads were stored at 4°c until use. in order to determine the effective loading of amino groups on the beads, both naïve and amino-modified glass and ceramic beads were incubated with nhs-fluorescein in the dark at 4°c for hrs. after completion of the reaction, the beads were washed with water and dried. naïve glass or ceramic beads displayed no fluorescence, nor did they fluoresce after incubation with nhs-fluorescein, while amino-modified glass and ceramic beads fluoresced after reaction with fluorescein. to quantitatively analyze the loading of amino groups on the surface of the beads, fluorescein was cleaved off by treatment with 1n hydrochloric acid. after the solution was neutralized to ph the released fluorescence was quantified by fluorometry. for the ceramic beads, the loading of fluorescein, which represents the number of amino groups on the beads available for reaction, was established to be μmol/g, which is the minimum possible loading of amino groups on the beads. since the density of ceramic beads is g/cc and the average diameter of bead is μm, it was estimated that there is one amino group every approximately Å of surface area, with a loading capacity of around × amino groups per ceramic bead. similar calculations estimated the capacity of the glass beads at × amino-groups per bead. to further investigate the distribution of the amino loading on the ceramic and glass beads, facs flow cytometry was utilized. after the reaction with nhs-fluorescein, over 90% of the ceramic and glass beads displayed fluorescence. thus, not only were the beads efficiently loaded with amino groups, but this loading was also uniformly distributed among the beads. together, these results indicate that both the ceramic and the glass beads met the desired requirements for serving as solid supports for the coupling of flavonoids, and the amino-modified beads have further potential for solid phase synthesis. modification and coupling of naringenin to the solid support initially, it was envisioned that the amino-loaded ceramic beads could be used for the direct coupling of naringenin, in the presence of a convenient linker such as dimethyl suberimidate. this approach, however, resulted to be impractical because technical limitations prevented the quantification of the amount of naringenin coupled to the beads, and it was feared that non-reacted amino groups on the beads or imidoester groups on the dms linker would react with components of the biological system that were intended to be probed. therefore, a different strategy was utilized, where the linker was first linked to the organosilane group on one end and naringenin on the other, followed by the coupling of the entire moiety to the beads. one equivalent of -dibromobutane was first reacted with naringenin, resulting in the formation of 7-naringenin with little amount of'-di naringenin as a by-product. after separation by chromatography on a silica column and structural elucidation by nmr, the 7-naringenin was reacted with aminopropyltriethoxysilane, to give compound. the compound was purified by chromatography on silica gel and confirmed to be 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin by nmr. once the identity of compound was confirmed, its coupling to sodium hydroxide-treated ceramic beads in 95% methanol was performed overnight. separation of the beads from non-conjugated compound was accomplished by filtration and washing. to ensure that compound was coupled to the beads, advantage was taken from the reactivity of nhs-fluorescein with the -nh- group present in 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin. the fluorescence detected is indicative of the coupling of the 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin to the ceramic and glass beads. to further quantify the amount of 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin coupled to the beads, the molar extinction coefficient of compound was first calculated at nm, corresponding to one of the absorption peaks of this compound. the ε value of cm-1m- was used to calculate the amount of compound that remained in solution after a coupling reaction was carried with a slight molar excess of 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin. the loading of compound was established to be μmol per gram of beads, corresponding to approximately × molecules of 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin per ceramic bead. using a similar approach, the coupling of 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin to the glass beads was established to be μmol/g, corresponding to × molecules per glass bead.  the development of a simple and reliable method to link flavonoids to solid supports, in this particular case, small glass and ceramic beads, is described here. interestingly, ceramic beads provided a much more robust solid support for coupling naringenin than the glass beads. these naringenin-coupled ceramic beads provide a convenient tool for the identification and isolation of naringenin-binding proteins. although these studies describe only the coupling of naringenin to the beads through the 7-oh group in ring a, the possibility to selectively protect the various -oh groups offers opportunities for presenting the different groups in naringenin for recognition by proteins. "," natural products have numerous medicinal applications and play important roles in the biology of the organisms that accumulate them. few methods are currently available for identifying proteins that bind to small molecules, therefore the discovery of cellular targets for natural products with pharmacological activity continues to pose a significant challenge in drug validation. similarly, the identification of enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis or modification of natural products remains a formidable bottleneck for metabolic engineering. flavonoids are one large group of natural products with a diverse number of functions in plants and in human health. the coupling of flavonoids to small ceramic and glass beads provides a first step in the development of high-throughput, solid-support base approaches to screen complex libraries to identify proteins that bind natural products.  the utilization of small glass and ceramic beads as solid supports for the coupling of small molecules was explored. initial characterization of the beads indicated uniform and high capacity loading of amino groups. once the beads were deemed adequate for the linking of small molecules by the coupling of nhs-fluorescein followed by microscopy, chemical hydrolysis and fluorometry, the flavonoid naringenin was modified with -dibromobutane, followed by the attachment of aminopropyltriethoxysilane. after nmr structural confirmation, the resulting 7-propylamino)butoxy) naringenin was attached to the ceramic beads.  our results demonstrate that ceramic and glass beads provide convenient solid supports for the efficient and facile coupling of small molecules. we succeeded in generating naringenin-coupled ceramic and glass beads. we also developed a convenient series of steps that can be applied for the solid-support coupling of other related flavonoids. the availability of solid-support coupled naringenin opens up new opportunities for the identification of flavonoid-binding proteins.

174," ischemic stroke is a major cause of neurological disability and a big burden on the family and society. regaining function can significantly reduce dependence and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors. ischemic stroke has a very complex pathophysiology. in addition to irreversible neuronal damage, ischemia also triggers cellular processes for neuronal repair involving remaining neurons. apoptosis and necrosis are two vital types of cell death in ischemic brain injury. recently, autophagic cell death has been reported as a third type of cell death in ischemic tissue. autophagy is a lysosomal pathway for recycling of organelles and long-lived proteins. in the course of autophagy, autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles, are formed to sequester cytoplasmic constituents. the autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to digest the contents for recycling. physiologically, autophagy plays a key role in adapting to nutritional deprivation and eliminating aggregated proteins. however, inappropriate activation of autophagy may lead to cell death in cerebral ischemia. although it is unclear whether autophagy prevents or contributes to apoptotic cell death, the interaction between autophagy-related and apoptosis-related proteins, suggests an interplay between apoptosis and autophagy. on the other hand, stroke also induces neurogenesis. it has been reported that newborn neurons can contribute to functional recovery after stroke. interestingly, down-regulation of either autophagy or apoptosis can increase neurogenesis after stroke. therefore, the functional outcome may be resulted from a complex interplay among autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis following cerebral ischemia. previously, we and others have demonstrated that physical exercise can improve functional recovery after stroke. the protective effects of physical exercise are partially associated with enhancement of neurogenesis and attenuation of apoptosis. it is necessary to investigate the effects of physical exercise on neuronal proliferation and death. although it has been proved that physical exercise can mitigate autophagy and enhance functional recovery after myocardial infarction in animals, the role of autophagy in exercise-induced functional recovery after stroke remains elusive. growth factors such as igf- also have benefitial effects on exercise-induced functional recovery in cerebral ischemia. it is also reported that up-regulation of igf- expression mitigates autophagy in some conditions. consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of physical exercise on ischemia-induced autophagy, apoptosis, neurogenesis and igf- in the peri-infarct region after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. in this study, we demonstrated that physical exercise could mitigate autophagosome accumulation, attenuate apoptosis, promote neurogenesis and igf- expression in the peri-infarct region, thus improving the functional recovery.  physical exercise improved functional recovery the effects of physical exercise on neurological function were evaluated using modified neurological severity score scale. the mnss were ±, ± and ± at and days in the exercise groups after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the mnss were ±, ±, ± and ± at and days in the control group after mcao, respectively. the repeated measures anova revealed a significant main effect of mnss at and days, an significant interaction between treatment effects and time effects at and days and a significant time effect at and days. but there was no significant difference between two groups at days after mcao. non-parametric analysis revealed that the mnss values at or days were much lower than those in control group at days, indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao. there was no significant difference in mean arterial pressure, rectal temperature, arterial blood gas values, glucose levels and body weight. physical exercise reduced the volume of the infarct area the relative infarct volumes were %± % at days in basal control group after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were %± % and %± % in physical exercise and control group at days after mcao. the relative infarct volumes were %± % and %± % at and days in the physical exercise group after mcao, respectively. in contrast, the relative infarct volumes were %± % and % ± % at and days in the control group after mcao, respectively. in control group, the infarct volumes were significantly smaller at and days than those at days after mcao, indicating a spontaneous recovery after mcao. compared with control group, physical exercise significantly reduced the infarct volumes at and days but not at days after mcao. interestingly, the attenuation of mnss was positively correlated with the reduction of infarct volumes. these findings suggest that physical exercise reduces brain damage and improves neurological function. physical exercise mitigated autophagosomes accumulation and attenuated apoptosis in the peri-infarct region to examine the involvement of autophagosomes, immunostaining was performed using an antibody against lc there are two forms of lc3—the cytosolic and membrane-bound forms. upon induction of autophagy, the cytosolic lc3-i is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form lc3-ii and the latter then translocates to the newly formed autophagosome membrane. therefore, lc staining shows a change from diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to intense punctate labelling when autophagosome formation is induced. lc staining remained diffuse within the cytoplasm in sham-operated rats or contra-lateral hemisphere. in contrast, lc staining displayed numerous punctate dots within the cytoplasm after transient mcao. lc3-immunopositive cells reached the peak in the peri-infarct region at days after mcao and decreased thereafter. there were significant differences in the number of lc3-punctate cells between control and physical exercise groups at and days, but not at days. compared with control group, physical exercise alleviated autophagy. furthermore, the number of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with both neurological function scores and relative infarct volumes, suggesting that activity of autophagy is associated with ischemic cellular injury. therefore, physical exercise improves functional recovery may, at least partially, through inhibition of autophagy. the tunel-positive cells were rare in the contra-lateral hemisphere and sham-operated group after mcao. in contrast, the tunel-positive cells were evident in peri-infarct region at days and then decreased gradually from to days. there were significant differences in the number of tunel-positive cells between physical exercise group and control group at and days, suggesting that physical exercise reduces apoptotic cell death. to further investigate the demise of lc3-positive cells, double-labeled immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies against lc and tunel. notably, double staining showed that % of lc3-positive cells were also stained with tunel. lc3/tunel double-positive cells were significantly lower in physical exercise groups than in control group. moreover, the induction of lc3-punctate cells was positively correlated with the number of tunel-positive cells. physical exercise increased the expression of igf- and promoted neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region igf-1-positive cells were evident on ischemic side but were rarely detected on the contra-lateral hemisphere. there was no co-localization between igf- and lc3-ii. compared with control group, physical exercise increased the expression of igf- at all the observed time points. ki a proliferative marker, was used to evaluate neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region. at days after mcao, ki67-positive cells were obvious in the peri-infarct region, but were barely visible in the contra-lateral cerebrum and sham-operated group. the number of ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region reached the peak at days and decreased thereafter. physical exercise significantly increased ki67-immunopositive cells in the peri-infarct region at, and days after mcao. discussion in the present study, we investigated the effects of physical exercise on autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis. we found that ischemia-induced autophagy was associated with apoptotic cell death but not with neurogenesis, suggesting a deleterious role of autophagy in brain ischemic injury. in addition to attenuating autophagy and apoptotic cell death, physical exercise also promoted igf- expression and cell proliferation, thereby improving functional recovery. the function of autophagy in exercise-mediated protection against ischemia still remains controversial. for example, in myocardial infarction, prior exercise maintains basal autophagy and protects against cardiac ischemic injury. on the other hand, post-ischemic exercise reduces the ratio of lc3ii/lc3i and improves functional recovery. it is generally believed that imbalance or excessive autophagy promotes cellular pathology and ultimately leads to cell death in cerebral ischemia. however, the relationship between autophagy and exercise-mediated neuroprotection is not clear. consistently, we found that autophagosomes were accumulated after focal cerebral ischemia. in contrast, physical exercise attenuated ischemia-induced autophagosome accumulation. the suppression of autophagy by exercise was positively associated with the recovery of neurological function and reduction of brain damage, suggesting that physical exercise may improve functional recovery from ischemic stroke, at least in part, through inhibition of autophagy. cell death, especially apoptosis, is a major contributor to neuronal damage in cerebral ischemia. the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis is very complex. autophagy can either promote or inhibit apoptosis under different conditions. interestingly, we found that tunel-positive and lc3-punctate cells were pronounced in the peri-infarct region and the number of tunel-positive cells was positively correlated with the number of lc3-punctate cells. physical exercise significantly reduced both autophagic and apoptotic cell death. given that autophagy and apoptosis can share many common death pathways. our findings suggest that autophagy may play a pathologic role in ischemic cell death whereas physical exercise may attenuate ischemia-induced brain damage through inhibition of common upstream signals for cell death. neurogenesis, particularly igf-1-mediated neurogenesis, is a major mechanism underlying beneficial effects of exercise on ischemic stroke. post-ischemic neurogenesis is a complex process involving coordination of multiple signaling pathways. it has been reported that autophagy can play opposite roles in regulating neurogenesis depending on different conditions. for example, activation of autophagy can modulate cell proliferation during neuronal development and regeneration. on the other hand, reducing autophagic activity has been shown to promote neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. in addition, igf- is also thought to have significant inhibitory actions on autophagy through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex. consistently, exercise significantly increased the numbers of igf-1- positive cells and ki67-labeled proliferation cells. however, lc was not co-localized with either igf- or ki- indicating that autophagy may not be directly involved in ischemia-induced neurogenesis. whether igf- plays a role in exercise-induced mitigation of atuophagy needs further investigation.  altogether, our results suggest that the benefit of physical exercise on functional recovery is associated with mitigation of autophagy, attenuation of apoptosis and enhancement of neurogenesis as evidenced by igf- expression and cell proliferation in the peri-infarct region after stroke. "," physical exercise improves functional recovery after stroke through a complex mechanism that is not fully understood. transient focal cerebral ischemia induces autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region. this study is aimed to examine the effects of physical exercise on autophagy, apoptosis and neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.  we found that autophagosomes, as labeled by microtubule-associated protein 1a light chain 3-ii, were evident in the peri-infarct region at days after 90-minute mcao. moreover, % of lc3-positive cells were also stained with tunel. the number of lc positive cells was significantly lower in physical exercise group than in control group at and days after mcao. suppression of autophagosomes by physical exercise was positively associated with improvement of neurological function. in addition, physical exercise significantly decreased the number of tunel-positive cells and increased the numbers of ki67-positive, a proliferative marker, and insulin-like growth factor- positive cells at and days after mcao.  the present results demonstrate that physical exercise enhances neurological function possibly by reduction of autophagosome accumulation, attenuation of apoptosis and enhancement of neurogenesis in the peri-infarct region after transient mcao in rats. physical exerciseautophagyapoptosisigf-1neurogenesismcao ",32a6aca3-63d4-491b-810e-31fdcb20d87a,pubmed
175," real-time pcr is a sensitive method for expression analysis widely used for both cell culture and complex tissues. relative quantification of mrna levels using real-time pcr data is commonly done using the 2^ method. a central idea of this method is the use of an endogenous control for normalization, a so-called housekeeping gene. the aim of this normalization is to correct for different amounts of starting material of rna or differences in the cdna synthesis efficiency. commonly used selection criteria for housekeeping genes are genes with the least amount of variance across all samples and genes that show no trends of change in relation to sample parameters of interest. however, because of lack of methods to determine low variance - other than real-time pcr itself - the selection of endogenous controls often comes precariously close to circular reasoning. vandesompele and coworkers have suggested methods to circumvent this, through the iterative calculation of pairwise correlations with other potential endogenous control genes and removal of the most deviating candidates. to investigate the merit of these endogenous control selection methods, we analyzed gene expression using different real-time pcr normalization setups and compared it with gene expression obtained using the fundamentally different approach of expression microarray measurements. the method of real-time pcr is often used as a gold standard with which to validate findings from expression microarray experiments. this view, that real-time pcr is a gold standard, might be true when looking at individual genes. however, the specific question of between-sample normalization is usually covered by measuring one or a few supposedly constant endogenous control genes. with microarrays, on the other hand, the large number of measured genes in microarrays gives a much broader base from which to address sample variation and normalization issues. we therefore propose to investigate the specific issue of real-time pcr normalization, using correlation to microarray data as our primary metric. herein, we present an analysis of human carotid plaque samples, for which gene expression data have been obtained with affymetrix hg-u plus arrays and for target genes using taqman real-time pcr. the plaque tissue is typically of a heterogeneous character, containing diverse populations of leukocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in various proportions. finding and validating a set of control genes that are stable across samples under these conditions is therefore essential for accurate measurement of gene expression levels.  selection of endogenous control genes we made a definition of established endogenous controls as genes available commercially, such as from applied biosystems. at the time of the analysis, they were: actb, b m, gapdh, gusb, hprt pgk ppia, rplp tbp, and tfrc. from these, gapdh, b m, ppia, rplp and tbp were selected as endogenous control candidates. they were selected, as described in methods. the ct value of each of these genes was submitted to the genorm plugin for investigation of the stability index. the most stable gene pair was gapdh and rplp in order of decreasing stability, they were followed by tbp, ppia, and b m. the exact definition of this method of classification is further described by vandesompele et al.. briefly, the two most stable genes are identified by calculating expression ratios, over all samples, for all pairwise combinations of genes. for each pair of genes, the standard deviation over all samples is calculated, and for each gene, the mean of all standard deviations is calculated. genes for which this value is highest are iteratively eliminated--in other words, the algorithm searches for genes that show the same expression profiles across all samples. comparison of real-time pcr expression data with microarray expression data real-time pcr data were obtained for different genes of interest in addition to the candidate endogenous controls. we compared the measurement of gene expression using these two methods of quantification. for each gene, this was done by creating a scatter plot, such as the example shown in figure scatter plots for all combinations of genes, probe sets, and endogenous control combinations are found in additional file pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for all of these combinations, and a summary can be seen in figure this figure prompts two discussions: a row-wise discussion of the differences in correlations between different genes and a column-wise discussion of the differences in correlations between different choices of endogenous controls. differences in correlations between genes some genes show good correlation between real-time pcr measurements and microarray measurements, and others do not. these differences can be explained biologically and technically. it was investigated whether there was any systematic technical bias of the real-time pcr-to-microarray correlation. this was done by comparing the correlation metric to the mean absolute expression level and the standard deviation, both for microarray values and real-time pcr values. this is shown as scatter plots in additional file and no patterns could be identified. technical imprecision in individual measurements can also be a problem. all microarray scans were subjected to standard quality control measures, as detailed in the methods section, in order to exclude problematic samples. for real-time pcr, replicate measurements can clarify if deviance is a result of technical imprecision. a technical variation threshold is described in methods. for most genes, there were only a few measurements with technical variation above this threshold. the exception was alox which had samples with coefficients of variance above this threshold. alox was present in very low quantities, with a mean ct of. the discrepancy between measurements of this gene is therefore concluded to be due to technical imprecision in real-time pcr, as it is reflected in the lack of correlation between microarray and real-time pcr data. the data are included in the analysis to show the effects of technical imprecision, but its removal does not change the final conclusion, as specified in the sensitivity analysis in the methods section. in addition to the threshold values in the bottom of additional file we have included the raw data from the real-time pcr measurements as additional file this threshold could possibly be used as a measure of comparison for use in other experiments that do not have microarray data to compare with. because of alternative splicing and the difference in probe location for the two measurements, biological variability can also explain differences in measurement techniques for some genes. it is therefore not necessarily sufficient to talk about measuring a particular gene with two methods; the measurements should also be performed on the same part of the gene. the locations of real-time pcr probes and primers and of microarray probe sets are shown for the examples of igf and ednra in figure for all other genes, the same plots are available in additional file endra shows a high degree of correlation, even though different sections of the gene are measured with the two techniques - the opposite is true for igf for igf alternative splicing is unlikely to be the reason behind the lack of correlation, but unfortunately, for almost all other genes, the real-time pcr primers and microarray probe locations are not in the same exon. without specific real-time pcr measurements of relevant regions, it is therefore difficult to make a decisive conclusion on the gene-wise differences in correlation between microarray and real-time pcr. focus shall therefore be on the column-wise discussion, as follows. differences in correlations between micorarray data and different real-time pcr normalizations in figure the differences in correlations between different choices of endogenous controls can be read in each column. as demonstrated, the best correlation between microarray and real-time pcr is, on average, obtained when no endogenous control is used. the results obtained by using the genorm method of vandesompele et al. ranks 13th and 17th among all possible combinations of one or more of endogenous control genes. this is an unexpected result, and it prompts a thorough discussion of the assumptions behind normalizations of pcr gene expression data. a functional definition of gene expression should be expressed in units of mrna per cell or nucleic mrna concentration or a similar measure, because this is the level at which changes will affect the biology of the cell. in effect, the methods we compare here all rely on one of three assumptions to get to this functional definition: 1) that there exist one or more genes for which the expression is at a sufficiently constant level to be proportional to the amount of cells across all samples; this is the assumption behind the concept of endogenous control in ΔΔct analysis; 2) that the overall distribution of the expression levels of all genes is the same in all cells, across all samples; this is the assumption behind the quantile normalization, which is the normalization part of the rma pre-processing algorithm used for microarray analysis; and 3) that the total concentration of rna is the same in all cells across all samples; this is the assumption behind the ""no endogenous control"" calculation of gene expression for real-time pcr data. this assumption stems from the fact that equal amounts of rna were used in the sample preparation for the real-time pcr measurements, and it could as well be labeled ""normalization to total rna mass."" it carries the further assumption that the reverse transcription of the rna to cdna does not introduce a bias.  we here present gene expression measurements, obtained with different methods, on the same set of rna samples. we analyze disagreements, which are of biological and technical origin: technical imprecision will surely obstruct data collection, but biological variation can also be thought to interfere through alternative splicing mechanisms. one finding is that introduction of housekeeping genes in the calculation perturbs the data without improving measurements. it has previously been speculated that normalizing to total rna mass will produce better results in complex tissue, and these results support that notion. the strength in our study is the high number of samples for which transcript analysis has been made with both real-time pcr and microarray. this in turns allow us to do the analysis on a detailed level. we see clear advantages with array analysis, because it has the total gene expression profile to normalize against. therefore, the obtained data seem more robust normalization-wise, compared with real-time pcr. the advantages with real-time pcr are the sensitivity and usually a more optimal and up-to-date design of probe-primer pairs. the data, however, seem to be distorted while going through an endogenous control normalization procedure, either by a single housekeeping gene used out of tradition by the research team or by the geometric mean method, suggested by others. while the bulk of the mass of total rna is ribosomal rna, our results show that it might nonetheless carry fewer perturbations to use this value as is. this conclusion is of course limited by the circumstances in which we measure. one factor that is likely to be crucial is the highly heterogeneous tissue in question. the plaque-derived samples contain varying compositions of different cell types, and this can cause problems when assuming constant expression level of any gene across many different cell types of highly varying transcriptomic composition. the risk that cell composition changes in a way that affects the rrna-to-mrna ratio is of course also present, but the data show that at least in this data set, this not the case. another factor that could be of interest to the conclusion is the methods with which the cdna for real-time pcr is prepared. the rna quality of all samples is carefully controlled, and degraded samples are excluded. furthermore, the quantification system in use could possibly provide for better precision than previously used spectrophotometers. "," gene expression microarrays and real-time pcr are common methods used to measure mrna levels. each method has a fundamentally different approach of normalization between samples. relative quantification of gene expression using real-time pcr is often done using the 2^ method, in which the normalization is performed using one or more endogenous control genes. the choice of endogenous control gene is often arbitrary or bound by tradition. we here present an analysis of the differences in expression results obtained with microarray and real-time pcr, dependent on different choices of endogenous control genes.  in complex tissue, microarray data and real-time pcr data show the best correlation when endogenous control genes are omitted and the normalization is done relative to total rna mass, as measured before reverse transcription.  we have found that for real-time pcr in heterogeneous tissue samples, it may be a better choice to normalize real-time pcr ct values to the carefully measured mass of total rna than to use endogenous control genes. we base this conclusion on the fact that total rna mass normalization of real-time pcr data shows better correlation to microarray data. because microarray data use a different normalization approach based on a larger part of the transcriptome, we conclude that omitting endogenous control genes will give measurements more in accordance with actual concentrations.

176," symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia leads to the development of specialized root organs, called nodules, in which nitrogen-fixing bacteria are accommodated intracellularly and are able to efficiently convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia and transfer it to the host plants. the legume nodule symbiosis is a one of the most efficient systems for plants to acquire nitrogen from the atmosphere. legumes have the unique ability to carry out symbiotic nitrogen fixation with rhizobial bacteria in root nodules. many efforts are underway to identify nodulation-related genes and their functions in lotus japonicas, medicago truncatula, and glycine max, long-established models for the study of legume biology. however, owing to the complexity of the transcriptional regulation of root nodule symbiosis, not all nodulation-related genes have been identified. more importantly, the functions of nodulation-related genes and how they interact with each other are even less well understood. thus, it is necessary to study nodulation using gene network analysis that can help to reveal many, or even most, of the underlying gene interactions and functions. gene networks or pathways can be computationally predicted using biological data, e.g. trancriptomes, protein-protein interactions, gene ontology similarities and text mining. these computational methods often suffer from high rates of false discovery. for example, very few systematic or genome-wide studies of nodulation gene interactions, other than co-expression, have been done. it is difficult to accurately identify the direct interactions using gene co-expression. second, most of the nodulation genes have orthologs in other plants, including arabidopsis thaliana, and go annotations of legume genes are often based on the go terms of their orthologs in a. thaliana. since nodulation is peculiar to legumes and a very few other species, the function of many nodulation genes may differ from their orthologs in non-nodulating species such as arabidopsis. therefore, the use of go annotations from orthologous genes may be misleading. third, text mining can automatically search the scientific literature and extract information for potential gene interactions. many tools have been developed to reconstruct gene networks from text mining. however, the complexity of natural language and the inconsistent use of gene names make text mining error-prone. we would like to create a user-curated, highly accurate database that would serve as a knowledge base for experimentally verified nodulation genes and their interactions. furthermore, this resource can also be used as highly accurate prior information in order to increase the power of gene network predictions. manual curation from peer-reviewed literature is the most accurate, but is time-consuming. in order to increase the efficiency of manual curation, we propose an alternative solution for creating a nodulation gene association database: crowdsourcing. crowdsourcing is an online activity in which an undefined, but generally large, group of people voluntarily undertake a task via an open call. the most extraordinary example of crowdsourcing is probably wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. the number of wikipedia articles quickly increased to over four million in the first five years since it was established, and the quality of articles in science was close to those in encyclopaedia britannica. the continuously updated, collaboratively written, and community-reviewed wiki model has been applied for both biology and bioinformatics. for example, wikigenes is a wiki-based platform for the scientific community to collect, communicate and evaluate knowledge about genes, chemicals, diseases and other biomedical concepts. gene wiki and lncrnawiki are similar platforms, but focused on human genes and long non-coding rnas, respectively. wikipathways is a wiki-based pathway curation resource, coupled with an graphical pathway editing tool. we present here an online platform for crowdsourcing nodulation gene network reconstruction with three goals: to i) comprehensively integrate knowledge of all known nodulation-related genes and gene interactions in legumes, ii) provide a user-friendly tool for interactively visualizing gene interactions and gene annotations, and iii) utilize the wiki model for collaborative editing. implementation the platform is open access and open source under mit license. the web server is a ubuntu. virtual machine image pre-built by bitnami, and is hosted on a t micro instance on amazon cloud. the image has pre-installed software packages for basic web development, including apache. mysql. and php. the platform has been tested on firefox chrome safari and all features should work in these browsers with equal or higher versions. the platform was written in javascipt and php, and the source code is hosted on github. with only a few configurations, the source code can be used to build similar platforms for other biological processes. researchers are welcome and encouraged to modify and improve the source code via github pull requests.  visualization the interface of the platform is a web page that displays the l. japonicas nodulation gene network using vis.js, a javascript library for dynamic and interactive data visualization. the gene network consists of a list of known nodulation-related genes and interactions between these genes, that were manually retrieved from literature. for example, the symbiosis receptor-like kinase gene, required for nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis of legumes, participates in a symbiotic signal transduction pathway during nodulation. thus, a node labeled ‘symrk’ is shown in the network. directed and unweighted edges represent gene interactions, e.g. receptor-binding, phosphorylation reactions and protein complexes. for example, cyclops is phosphorylated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, and the phosphorylated cyclops becomes an active transcription factor that transactivates the nodule inception gene. these interactions are represented by two solid directed edges that point from ccamk to cyclops, and from cyclops to nin, respectively. the lists of nodulation related genes and gene interactions currently included in the gene network can be found at http://crowd.bioops.info/mediawiki/index.php/nodes and http://crowd.bioops.info/mediawiki/index.php/edges, respectively. the gene network can also be downloaded as a json format file.fig. screenshots of crowdnodnet. a the main page, displaying the nodulation gene network in lotus japonicas. b once a gene is selected, the gene and its edges are highlighted and the gene’s annotation document appears. c the mediawiki page of a gene users can hover over a gene to see the gene’s full name, and the gene and its edges are highlighted. users can further click on the gene and a document containing the gene’s annotation information, retrieved from the mediawiki page, will appear on the left part of the same page ensuring that users can easily access the annotation information for a gene. editing new nodes and edges can be added by point-and-click on the main page. under the editing mode, users can click a blank region to add a new node. a dialog window with a form will appear for users to enter the new gene’s information, including symbol, full name and id. in order to ensure unique gene ids and maintain flexibility of editing at the same time, we implemented autosuggestion and autocompletion features for the input form. thus, users can type in a gene symbol, full name or a uniprot id, and a list of possible genes will appear for the user to choose from. in this case, the added gene is automatically assigned a uniprot id. users may manually input new genes without uniprot ids via entering a gene id, symbol, and full name. a new edge can be added in the same way as a new gene. users can manually connect two genes under the editing mode. in the dialog window, they will then select the direction and the type of interaction. different lines represent different types of interactions: solid line with arrow indicates activation; a dashed line with arrow indicates inhibition; and a solid line without arrow indicates other or unknown interactions type. users can hover over an edge to see the interaction type. mediawiki, the open-source software originally developed for wikipedia, can be easily used to create wiki-like websites. crowdnodnet has some mediawiki webpages containing information about the gene network: genes, gene interactions and gene annotations. a php script parses these webpages and displays the annotation in the main page. once the mediawiki pages are modified, the gene annotation shown in the main page is updated accordingly. therefore, users can edit the gene annotation by modifying mediawiki pages, much in the same way as editing wikipedia pages. each gene usually has its own mediawiki page containing the annotation information. from the main page, the gene’s document appears once a user clicks that gene node. an “edit” link is shown at the top of the document, which allows the user to edit the gene’s mediawiki page. when a new gene is added and a user wants to annotate that gene, they can create a page using the “create annotation” link in the gene’s document. currently, editing is open to everyone and users can edit after registering an account. annotations a gene’s mediawiki page is expected to contain the following annotation information: the full gene name, mrna and protein sequences, mutants, biological functions, gene expression, interactions with other genes, gene evolution, etc. a description for each component is listed in table  for example, symrk’s uniprot id is q8lkx and it is mapped to microarray probeset gi21622627_at on the affymetrix lotus genechip®. three symrk mutant alleles with nonsense mutation or large insertions cause the absence of root hair curling, infection thread and nodule primordia. symrk, containing a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular protein kinase domain, is required for both nodule and arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. although one study showed that transcriptional regulation of symrk, nod factor receptor and nod factor receptor is mutually independent, symrk is able to form a complex with nfr after the extracytoplasmic region is cleaved. a symrk-interacting protein was also found to form a protein complex with symrk. the symrk kinase domain is highly conserved between legumes and actinorhizal plants, but its extracellular regions are highly variable. all the above annotation information for symrk is available at http://crowd.bioops.info/mediawiki/index.php?title=symrk. users can add refernces following the mediawiki format. other annotation information can be added, and users are encouraged to annotate the gene in as much detail as possible. once a user creates a new annotation page, a structured template, including all the necessary annotation sections, is automatically loaded in the editing area so that the user can easily fill in content following detailed guidelines for each section.table gene annotation information in crowdnodnet  the online platform, crowdnodnet, was created for crowdsourcing nodulation gene networks. researchers can use the platform to interactively visualize and easily edit this, or just about any, gene network. it is expected that this will become a comprehensive and collaborative knowledge base of nodulation-related genes and pathways which should help researchers access integrated information and share new discoveries in legume-rhizobial symbiosis. the platform allows users to interactively visualize and edit the gene network in a dynamic and interactive manner, and easily access information about the network. moreover, all the gene annotation information is written on mediawiki pages. the network can be edited by by point-and-click on the main page and editing gene information is the same as editing a wikipedia page, so the learning process is relatively short or even negligible. the platform we constructed is focused on a single pathway. as compared with existing pathway and network databases that include all biological processes and many species, the decentralized and single pathway-based database is easy to circulate within a relatively small community. all these features make it easier to attract experts for continued contribution and development. abbreviations ccamk, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase; nfr nod factor receptor 1; nfr nod factor receptor 5; nin, nodule

"," the legumes are an economically and ecologically important group of plant species with the conspicuous capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules, specialized plant organs containing symbiotic microbes. with the aim of understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to nodulation, many efforts are underway to identify nodulation-related genes and determine how these genes interact with each other. in order to accurately and efficiently reconstruct nodulation gene network, a crowdsourcing platform, crowdnodnet, was created.  the platform implements the jquery and vis.js javascript libraries, so that users are able to interactively visualize and edit the gene network, and easily access the information about the network, e.g. gene lists, gene interactions and gene functional annotations. in addition, all the gene information is written on mediawiki pages, enabling users to edit and contribute to the network curation.  utilizing the continuously updated, collaboratively written, and community-reviewed wikipedia model, the platform could, in a short time, become a comprehensive knowledge base of nodulation-related pathways. the platform could also be used for other biological processes, and thus has great potential for integrating and advancing our understanding of the functional genomics and systems biology of any process for any species. the platform is available at http://crowd.bioops.info/, and the source code can be openly accessed at https://github.com/bioops/crowdnodnet under mit license. keywords gene networkcrowdsourcingnodule symbiosishttp://dx.doi.org/ /100000001national science foundationmcb 1339194issue-copyright-statement© the author 2016 ",e2525afd-7b8a-44f8-bbc7-09444b6d27ae,pubmed
177," treatment of lactating cows with recombinant bovine somatotropin can increase milk yield in thermoneutral and heat-stress environments. the consequences of bst treatment for fertility are not clear. in early studies, cows treated with bst had an increased calving to conception interval that was attributed, at least in part, to increased anestrus. in contrast, bst either increased or had no effect on pregnancy rate per insemination when cows were inseminated using a timed artificial insemination protocol. treatment with bst increased pregnancy rate per insemination for repeat-breeder cows bred at estrus. bovine st might be particularly effective at increasing fertility during periods of heat stress. this is because insulin-like growth factor-, whose secretion is stimulated by bst, has thermoprotective properties and can reduce the effect of elevated temperature on development and apoptosis of cultured bovine embryos. indeed, the proportion of heat-stressed lactating cows receiving an in vitro produced embryo that became pregnant was higher when embryos were cultured in igf- before transfer. this effect of igf- was not seen for cows in cool weather. despite the promise of using bst in the summer to increase igf- and improve embryonic resistance to heat stress, there was no effect of bst on pregnancy rate in the one experiment that examined bst effects on fertility during heat stress. in this experiment, cows received bst every days beginning days before tai. the failure to observe an increase in fertility caused by bst may have been because bst also increased body temperature. the hypothesis of the current study was that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bst during the preovulatory period could improve fertility of lactating cows. the rationale for the hypothesis was that bst, directly or through an increase in igf- secretion, would increase fertility by exerting beneficial effects on follicular function, oocyte function and embryonic development. in heat–stressed cows, bst would also be thermoprotective towards the embryo through actions of igf-. treatment with bst was limited to a single injection around the time of ovulation to exert effects on late follicular development, ovulation, and early embryonic development while avoiding milk yield responses during the peri-ovulatory period that could enhance hyperthermia or otherwise limit the possible beneficial effect of bst on fertility.  effects of bst at insemination in cows in a temperate climate as shown in table there was no effect of bst on the proportion of cows that were pregnant following insemination. in addition, there was no significant effect of breeding at estrus vs tai, parity or days in milk on pregnancy rate per insemination. a abbreviations are bst; bovine somatotropin; aor, adjusted odds ratio; ci, 95% confidence interval. b data are the number of cows pregnant/total cows inseminated and, in parentheses, percent pregnant. effects of bst in cows exposed to heat stress the 24-h pattern of vaginal temperatures is shown in fig. time of day affected vaginal temperature. the peak temperature for both groups was °c and occurred at 23: h for control cows and 18: h for bst-treated cows. the nadir, °c for both control and bst-treated cows, occurred at 08: and 09: h, respectively. vaginal temperature was not affected by bst treatment, day relative to tai, or interactions between these main effects and other variables. body condition score at tai was not different between control and bst-treated cows. cows were considered to be successfully synchronized if progesterone concentration on the day of tai was < ng/ml and progesterone concentration on day after tai was ≥ ng/ml. using this criterion, there was a tendency for a lower percent of control cows to be synchronized than bst-treated cows. further examination of progesterone concentrations revealed that, regardless of treatment, over 90% of cows had low progesterone concentrations at day however, there was a tendency for a smaller percent of control cows to have high progesterone at day than for bst-treated cows. thus, a smaller percent of cows ovulated in response to tai for control cows than for bst-treated cows. a abbreviations are bst; bovine somatotropin; aor, adjusted odds ratio; ci, 95% confidence interval; ns, non-significant b data are the number of cows with that classification/total cows inseminated and, in parentheses, percent. body condition score at tai also affected the successful synchronization rate. cows with bcs ≥ were more likely to have been successfully synchronized than cows with bcs <. results for pregnancy following tai are presented in table among all cows, the percent of cows pregnant following tai was not statistically affected by treatment. numerically, the percent of inseminated cows that was pregnant was lower for control cows than for cows treated with bst. this nonsignificant difference between groups was diminished in magnitude when the percent of inseminated cows that were pregnant was calculated for the subset of cows that were successfully synchronized. a abbreviations are bst; bovine somatotropin; aor, adjusted odds ratio; ci, confidence interval; ns, non-significant b data are the number of cows pregnant/total cows inseminated and, in parentheses, percent pregnant. ccows where progesterone concentration on the day of timed artificial insemination was < ng/ml and progesterone concentration on day after tai was ≥ ng/ml. discussion results from the present study failed to support the hypothesis that administration of a sustained-release form of bst near the time of insemination improves fertility of lactating dairy cows. the hypothesis that bst improves fertility was tested independently at two different locations, with two different commercial bst preparations and using different breeding procedures. in the first experiment, conducted in the absence of heat stress and with most cows bred at natural estrus, there was no significant effect of bst on the percent of cows pregnant following first service. the preparation of bst used in the first experiment also contained vitamin e. administration of vitamin e at insemination was without effect on pregnancy rate in lactating cows. in the second experiment, where cows were heat-stressed and where tai was the sole method for breeding cows, there was a numerical increase in the percent of cows pregnant following insemination for cows treated with bst as compared to control cows. however, this difference was not statistically different. moreover, the numerical increase associated with bst was associated with effects on the response to ovulation synchronization rather than to effects on fertilization rate or embryonic survival. specifically, bst tended to improve the percent of cows that ovulated after the ovulation synchronization protocol. the difference in percent of cows pregnant after tai between control and bst-treated cows was reduced when only successfully-synchronized cows were considered. experiments to evaluate the beneficial effects of bst on ability of cattle to establish and maintain pregnancy after insemination in cattle have yielded variable results. administration of a single injection of bst at insemination did not improve pregnancy rate per insemination in cows or beef heifers. however, a single injection of bst at estrus increased the percent of repeat-breeder dairy cows pregnant following insemination. injections of bst increased pregnancy success in dairy cows bred to tai in some studies but not in others. differences in treatment regimens, product formulation, reproductive management, cow type and issues related to sample size could explain some of this variation. for example, bst improved pregnancy success for cows subjected to a presynch-ovsynch synchronization protocol but did not cause improvement for cows receiving an ovsynch protocol without presynchronization. taken together, the lack of a consistent fertility-promoting effect of bst would contraindicate broad use of bst to improve fertility in lactating cows. additional work is needed to confirm its efficacy in selected populations of cows, for example in repeat-breeder cows. it was hypothesized that cows exposed to heat stress would be particularly likely to benefit from administration of bst because igf- which is released in response to bst, can protect bovine preimplantation embryos from the deleterious effects of elevated temperature on development. nonetheless, bst did not improve fertility in experiment despite the fact that cows experienced vaginal temperatures characteristic of hyperthermia throughout most of the day. there are several explanations for the lack of effect of bst during heat stress. for instance, it is possible that bst was not administered until damage to the oocyte had already occurred. heat stress can compromise the follicle somewhere between 20– days before ovulation and administration of bst three days before ovulation, as performed here, would probably not reverse oocyte damage occurring earlier in follicular development. the bst was not administered earlier relative to ovulation in experiment because of the desire to avoid the effect of bst on milk yield that could possibly result in increased body temperature. in fact, the bst treatment did not increase vaginal temperature. another possibility is that early embryos are refractory to the thermoprotective actions of igf- the only stage of development at which igf- has been shown to reduce negative effects of elevated temperature on embryos is at day after insemination. finally, it is possible that treatment with bst may not change the bioavailable igf- in the follicular, oviductal or uterine environment sufficiently to protect oocytes or embryos from elevated temperature. treatment of lactating cows with bst increased amounts of igf- in follicular fluid but not in uterine flushings. in experiment the proportion of cows that ovulated following the ovulation synchronization protocol tended to be greater for cows treated with bst. this possible effect of bst did not reflect a difference in luteolysis following administration of pgf2α because there was no difference between control and bst-treated cows in the proportion of cows with low progesterone concentrations on the putative day of ovulation. perhaps bst increased luteinizing hormone release in response to gnrh or increased the rate of follicular development so that preovulatory follicles were more likely to respond to lh. the literature is equivocal as to whether bst affects lh secretion but it is well established that bst can enhance follicular growth.  results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bst treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows. "," results regarding the use of bovine somatotropin for enhancing fertility in dairy cattle are variable. here, the hypothesis was tested that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bovine somatotropin during the preovulatory period would improve pregnancy success of lactating dairy cows at first service.  the first experiment was conducted in a temperate region of mexico. cows inseminated following natural estrus or timed artificial insemination were given a single injection of bst or a placebo injection at insemination. there was no significant difference between bst and control groups in the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant. the second experiment was performed during heat stress in florida. cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization regimen for first insemination. cows treated with bst received a single injection at days before insemination. controls received no additional treatment. as expected, bst did not increase vaginal temperature. treatment with bst did not significantly increase the proportion of inseminated cows diagnosed pregnant although it was numerically greater for the bst group. there was a tendency for a smaller percent of control cows to have high plasma progesterone concentrations at day after insemination than for bst-treated cows. when only cows that were successfully synchronized were considered, the magnitude of the absolute difference in the percentage of inseminated cows that were diagnosed pregnant between bst and control cows was reduced.  results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bst treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows.

178," a multitude of assays have been developed to measure t cell responses to a variety of antigens. there is little agreement as to which method is the most superior for detecting immune responses. antigen specific t cell proliferation as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation and ifn-gamma elispot are two of the most commonly used methods to measure t cell immunity. we questioned if there was a difference in the ability of these assays to measure a broad range of t cell responses. in this study we utilized t cells from cancer patients that had been immunized with both a her-2/neu protein based vaccine as well as a tetanus toxoid vaccine. both vaccines were successful in generating antigen specific antibody immunity, an indicator of immunization. evaluating three immunogenic proteins, her-2/neu, tt, and cmv in these patients as representative of low, intermediate, and robust responses we determined that the proliferation assay was a better discriminator of low level immune responses than elispot. these data highlight the need for immunologic monitoring core laboratories to define the performance characteristics of the methods chosen to assess the development of a t cell immune response.  antibody immunity to both foreign and tumor antigens is an indicator of a concomitant t cell response a standard measure of successful immunization is the development of antigen specific humoral immunity. furthermore, the presence of humoral immunity may serve as a marker for the presence of antigen specific cd4+ t cells. breast cancer patients were immunized against the her-2/neu icd protein and tt, and humoral immunity to these antigens measured by elisa. antibody responses to cmv, a viral antigen presumed to stimulate a robust immune reaction, were also measured by elisa. successful immunization against her-2/neu, as indicated by the presence of her-2/neu specific antibodies, was achieved in 89% of patients. successful immunization against tt, as indicated by the presence of tt specific antibodies, was achieved in 100% of patients. forty-four percent of the patients were cmv seropositive. linear regression analysis of all results was performed to determine the correlation of antibody immunity to a detectable t cell response. antibody response predicted t cell response when t cell response was assessed by either proliferation assay or elispot assay. humoral immunity significantly predicted cd4+ t cell proliferation with an r of, and humoral immunity significantly predicted ifn-gamma secretion with an r of. thus, humoral immunity and t cell immunity correlated in both foreign and tumor antigen systems. the magnitude of the t cell response differed significantly between antigens. the range of t cell immunity to her-2/neu was low to moderate with a mean si of and a mean precursor frequency of precursors/ pbmc. responses to tt were moderate to robust with a mean si of and mean precursor frequency of precursors/ pbmc. responses to cmv were robust with a mean si of and a mean precursor frequency of precursors/ pbmc. mean antibody responses to her-2/neu, tt and cmv were ug/ml, ug/ml and ug/ml, respectively. we questioned the sensitivity of these two assays, cd4+ proliferation and ifn-gamma elispot, in detecting this wide range of responses. t cell proliferation will detect t cell immunity whether the immune response is low, moderate or robust roc curves were plotted to assess sensitivity and specificity of the proliferation assay, using presence of antigen specific antibodies as a marker of successful immunization. results show that si is a significant predictor of immunity to the her-2/neu icd protein with an auc of. this yielded a sensitivity of 83%. a subset of these patients was assessed by proliferation assay for cellular immunity to antigens tt and cmv. results show that si is a significant indicator of moderate cellular immunity to tt with a sensitivity of 100%, and cmv with a sensitivity of 100%. only cmv seronegative patient had a positive cmv specific si. thus, the proliferation assay is capable of accurately detecting low, moderate, and robust t cell immunity. ifn-gamma secretion as measured by elispot accurately detects robust t cell immunity roc curves were plotted to assess sensitivity and specificity of the elispot assay, using presence of antigen specific antibodies as a marker of successful immunization. results show that elispot did not significantly detect low level immunity to her-2/neu or tt. precursor frequency is not a significant indicator of immunity to the her-2/neu icd protein with an auc of and sensitivity of 64%. a subset of these patients was assessed by elispot assay for cellular immunity to antigens tt and cmv. results show that precursor frequency is not a significant indicator of moderate level cellular immunity to tt, but that elispot will significantly predict robust t cell immunity to cmv with an auc of. the sensitivity for the elispot tt and cmv assays were 67% and 88%, respectively. thus, the elispot assay is most accurate when assessing robust t cell immunity. there were few false positives in this population. that is, patients without an antibody response usually lacked a t cell response as well, by either t cell assay method. a cutoff of for si for the proliferation assay for her-2/neu specific cd4+ t cells accurately identified 78% of seropositive and seronegative samples, with false positives and false negatives. the her-2/neu elispot accurately identified 56% of seropositive and seronegative samples, with false positives and false negatives. the tt proliferation assay correctly identified all samples, and the tt elispot 67%, with false negatives. the cmv proliferation assay correctly identified 88% with false positive samples, and the cmv elispot correctly identified 92% of samples, with false negative. discussion while infectious disease antigens, in general, stimulate a very robust t cell immune response that can easily be detected using a variety of assays, immunity to tumor antigens is generally low level. for this reason, to evaluate the immune response against cancer antigens, assays are needed that can detect a broad range of t cell responses i.e. from innate to induced immunity. we focused on evaluating the sensitivity of two commonly used methods for assessing tumor specific immunity; the proliferation of t cells after antigen exposure measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine and ifn-gamma elispot. compared to other methods of t cell assessment, such as flow cytometry or tetramer analysis, these assays are technically simple, easy to perform for all levels of lab personnel, require smaller numbers of cells, and reagents which are readily available and inexpensive. very few studies have attempted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of assays that measure cellular immune responses after vaccination. a major problem preventing such an analysis is the definition of a parameter that predicts that immunity has been successfully elicited. we used the development of humoral immunity to indicate that tumor antigen and foreign antigen vaccinations were effective in stimulating a detectable immune response. humoral immunity has long been used as an accepted measure of successful immunization. presence of antigen specific antibodies indicates exposure to antigen and as such is considered proof of immunity to common infectious diseases such as measles and influenza. vaccine development for infectious disease continues to rely on antibody presence as an indicator not only of exposure to antigen, but as a surrogate of protection against disease. indeed, antigen specific humoral immunity is an indicator for the development of an antigen specific t cell response. in one study, t cell responses measured by ifn-gamma elispot were significantly associated with antibody responses induced by vaccination against p. falciparum protein. a recent population-based analysis of immune responses to mmr vaccination found that an antigen specific antibody response was significantly associated with antigen specific t cell proliferation, and that lymphoproliferation was in turn associated with production of ifn-gamma as measured by cytokine elisa. thus, although not a perfect measure or ""gold standard"", humoral immunity can be used as a meaningful determinate of effective immunization by which the t cell assays could be assessed and compared. antibody responses to tumor associated antigen demonstrate exposure to tumor, and may be significantly associated with antigen specific cellular responses. however, the relationship between presence of antigen specific antibodies, presence of antigen specific t cells, and clinical response in cancer is not as well characterized as the relationship between antibody and t cell responses, and clinical response in infectious diseases such as malaria. recently, the presence of tumor-infiltrating t cells has recently been associated with clinical response in various cancers, and antigen specific t cells have been shown necessary for tumor destruction. thus, direct assay of t cell responses, both in terms of measuring quantities and frequencies of t cells and in terms of characterizing t cell function, remains an essential component in elucidating the relationship between immune responses and clinical outcome, and in the immunologic monitoring of clinical trials. due to the large number of cells required to perform the proliferation and elispot assays, not all of the samples contained sufficient quantity to perform both assays. it is interesting to note that although the elispot assay for response to cmv tested only samples, compared to the samples tested for cmv responses by proliferation assay, both methods produced results which predicted positive humoral immunity to cmv. in contrast, all samples were tested for her-2/neu specific responses using both elispot and proliferation assays, and only the proliferation assay produced results which were a significant predictor of antibody immunity. it is possible that the lack of concordance between tt specific results by elispot and tt specific antibody immunity is due to the difference in samples size between t cell assays, as only samples were of sufficient quantity to obtain results by elispot, compared to the available for testing by proliferation assay. similarly, cell quantities limited the elispot assay to measurement of only ifn-gamma. this may in part explain the elispot's lack of sensitivity in determining low level responses. although increasing the breadth of cytokine analysis to include measurement of other cytokine responses such as il- or il- may lead to greater sensitivity, the measurement of ifn-gamma alone is standard for most clinical trials.  the antigens we chose to evaluate, her-2/neu, tt, and cmv, represented a broad range of responses, from low level to robust. as the majority of patients developed humoral immunity to both her-2/neu and tt we were able to evaluate the two cell based analytic methods for the ability to detect low level t cell immunity. antigen specific t cell proliferation discriminated a broader range of responses than elispot. there have been few studies directly comparing t cell assays. one recent study, karlsson et al in compared elispot to cytokine flow cytometry and found a lack of association between results when considering low level responses, and that the elispot assay performed better in detecting such responses. other groups compared thymidine incorporation proliferation assays to brdu elisa or cfse proliferation assay. the first study found the brdu elisa performance superior to traditional proliferation assay in detecting low level responses; however, the study involved only cells obtained from rat lymph nodes, not human pbmc. the second study specifically looked at rare antigen specific t cells in human pbmc and found the cfse assay had superior sensitivity within a small sample set. the only study available which evaluates elispot and proliferation assays found that the proliferation assay was not sensitive enough to detect ca- specific t cells in healthy controls or patients with ovarian cancer. data presented here, on a much larger number of individuals who have documented evidence of successful immunization, would suggest that there are marked differences in the ability of two of the most common cellular immunologic monitoring methods in measuring different levels of t cell immunity. these considerations should be taken into account when choosing analytic methods for assessing the development of t cell immunity, particularly when evaluating tumor specific immune responses which are, for the most part, of low to moderate magnitude. "," standardization of cell-based immunologic monitoring is becoming increasingly important as methods for measuring cellular immunity become more complex. we assessed the ability of two commonly used cell-based assays, tritiated thymidine incorporation and ifn-gamma elispot, to predict t cell responses to her-2/neu, tetanus toxoid, and cytomegalovirus antigens. these antigens were determined to be low, moderate, and robustly immunogenic proteins. samples from stage ii, iii, and iv her-2/neu positive breast cancer patients, vaccinated against the her-2/neu protein and tt, were analyzed by tritiated thymidine incorporation and ifn-gamma elispot for t cell response.  linear regression analysis indicates that both stimulation index and ifn-gamma secreting precursor frequency are significant indicators of antigen specific immunity. roc curves plotted to assess the performance of tritiated thymidine incorporation and the elispot assay indicate that si is a significant indicator of low t cell response to the her-2/neu vaccine, and of moderate and robust responses to tt and cmv, respectively. ifn-gamma precursor frequency is a significant indicator of a robust t cell response to cmv, but not of moderate tt, or low her-2/neu t cell responses.  these data underscore the importance of taking into consideration the performance characteristics of assays used to measure t cell immunity. this consideration is particularly necessary when determining which method to utilize for assessing responses to immunotherapeutic manipulations in cancer patients.

179," the escherichia coli uropathogenic-specific protein has been shown to be associated with e. coli strains that provoke pyelonephritis, prostatitis and bacteraemia, and with increased virulence and fitness of pathogenic strains of e. coli. nucleotide sequence analysis has shown approximately 45% sequence identity of the usp c-terminal region with that of the e. coli bacteriocin colicin e which has nuclease activity, while the usp n-terminal region is similar to the type vi protein secretion system component. it has been proposed that usp acts as a bacteriocin against competing e. coli strains and that it also enhances infectivity in the urinary tract. recently, we demonstrated the genotoxic activity of usp against mammalian cells. to protect the colicin-producing cell from its own toxin, colicin-encoding operons generally harbour one cognate immunity gene. colicins and their immunity proteins have some of the strongest protein-protein affinities, which result in the formation of stable colicin–immunity protein complexes. in contrast, downstream of the usp gene, there are three short open reading frames designated orfu1-, that are believed to be involved in the protection of the usp-producing cell from its own nuclease activity. the immunity proteins coded by the usp gene operon have a characteristic two-histidine region which appears to enable the inactivation of the usp dnase activity. however, usp-encoding strains that do not have all three orfu immunity protein genes have been described. all three immunity proteins are thus not essential for the protection of the usp producers, although usp is lethal when it is expressed alone in e. coli. it has been postulated that none of the three proteins is exclusively required for usp protein synthesis. as protection of the usp-producing bacterial cell might be provided by a mechanism that is different from that of the colicins, we have investigated the e. coli usp-associated immunity protein imu previously designated orfu our study indicates that imu has protective non specific dna-binding abilities that could have possible biotechnological potential.  isolation of immunity protein with ni-nta affinity chromatography provided protein fractions with appropriate purity;. dna binding ability was not affected by the presence or absence of the his-tag, as both precipitated linear dna. the theoretical and actual mass of the purified imu differed by  da, indicating that imu is not post-translationally modified. parret and demot previously described an approximately 45% sequence identity of the c-terminal region of the usp protein with known nuclease colicins, such as colicins e and e although it has been shown that colicin e and its immunity protein form a high-affinity complex, we were not able to confirm the formation of a high affinity complex between usp and any of the three smaller proteins encoded downstream of the usp gene which were previously proposed to protect the usp-producing cell against its endonucleolytic activity. nevertheless, our results showed that imu protects isolated dna from digestion by the nuclease colicin e indicating a nonspecific protection mechanism that is distinct from that of the colicin immunity proteins. induction of the cloned usp gene was either lethal or resulted in severely diminished growth. of the three potential immunity proteins, when cloned separately downstream of the usp gene, imu showed the greatest degree of protection as the number of transformants obtained was repeatedly higher, with larger colonies than for the other two. we therefore focused our further investigation on imu e. coli by the individual imu proteins usp + usp + usp + usp + relative numbers of transformants obtained with plasmids carrying the usp gene without and with the individual imu genes. imu dimerisation and usp binding imu has fairly high sequence similarity to the colicin e immunity protein cei, approximately 66% sequence identity as established with the mega program package, which was previously reported to form monomers. we investigated potential dimer formation by imu using the cross-linking glutaraldehyde assay, native page electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. native page as well as hplc experiments clearly showed that, imu does not form dimers or multimers since a single peak of size between and 13 kda was observed regardless of the presence or absence of dna. cross-linking studies of equimolar mixtures of imu and usp also showed no complex formation. dna/rna binding our data thus indicate that the usp-producing cell is protected from the dnase activity of its own usp by a mechanism that is distinct from that of colicin-producing cells. surprisingly, emsa showed that imu binds linear and circular dna as well as rna molecules. when imu reached a critical concentration, it repeatedly precipitated the dna, which resulted in total retardation/precipitation of dna in the electrophoresis. when imu was subjected to treatment with increasing concentrations of ions, the effects of dna retardation were decreased. incubations at higher temperatures also reduced the gel shift effects of imu on dna. the emsa studies with dna or e. coli total rna clearly showed that imu has dna-binding as well as rna-binding abilities. no such activity was observed with imu or imu. furthermore, thermal denaturation curves showed a stabilising effect of imu on the linear double-stranded dna molecule. the melting temperature of dna alone was 73°c, which increased by 3°c when an aliquot of  μg imu was added in the emsa studies. the dna melting temperature was further raised by an additional 13°c when a 1 μg aliquot of imu was added. this concentration of imu saturated the dna, and the melting curve revealed a two-phase thermal transition. one transition showed a stabilisation effect, whereas the other transition was shown to be destabilising, most probably due to partial dna precipitation. minimal dna length for imu binding binding of short dna fragments to imu occupied all its free dna binding sites, and therefore prevented subsequent binding of imu to indicator dna. these emsa tests showed that free imu starts to bind to oligonucleotides longer than base pairs, observed as the reappearance of unbound indicator dna. these results indicate that base pairs is the minimal dna length required for imu binding. emsa tests with short double stranded dna fragments were also performed however, the results were inconclusive since we repeatedly observed the recurring effect of unbound imu that re-/dis-appeared every 3- nucleotides of the oligonucleotide length; however, the underlying basis of this phenomena is unclear. separation of imu from dna and subsequent dna integrity analysis separation of the dna-imu complex, was examined under different conditions. exposure of the dna–imu complex to ph values between ph  and ph  showed separation at values between ph  and ph  however, at ph values higher than ph , dna degradation was also observed. when the dna–imu complex was heated to 100°c for 5 min in the presence of different nacl concentrations, separation of imu from dna was observed at  m nacl or higher. incubation of imu3-dna complexes with proteinase k resulted in unbound dna due to degradation of imu to determine whether dna exposed to imu could subsequently be used for molecular biological manipulations, linear plasmid pbr dna that had been previously complexed with imu was purified with the qiagen commercial kit. this dna could be re-ligated, transformed into e. coli, and again subjected to restriction enzyme activity. the integrity of precipitated and religated plasmid dna was confirmed on the basis of expression of the ampicillin resistance gene among analysed transformants. all procedures were also performed with dna that had not been previously complexed as a control, and no apparent losses in quantity or quality of dna were observed. further, we found that imu precipitated dna from highly diluted solutions, where 1 μl of linear plasmid dna was diluted in 15 ml. this procedure yielded less dna as the control but could without doubt be optimised with appropriate protocol modification. the colicin dnases and their cognate immunity proteins are known to form high affinity complexes with the dnase domain. in the present study, despite its two preserved histidines, as nuclease inactivation motifs that are present throughout the dnase immunity protein family, imu showed no coupling with the usp protein, and imu alone was shown to be sufficient for protection of usp-producing cells. not unexpectedly due to the sequence similarity of imu with the colicin e immunity protein, which was shown by dennis et al. to be monomeric, we demonstrated, on the basis of different experiments that imu does not undergo dimerisation or multimerisation. to the best of our knowledge, no known functions have been described yet for the protein products of orfu orfu and orfu. although all three immunity proteins of the usp cluster share a high degree of sequence similarity, the present study shows that imu has a distinct rna- and dna-binding ability. nevertheless, additional as of yet unresolved mechanisms could be involved in protection of usp producing cells by its cognate immunity proteins. interestingly, protein-mediated dna precipitation has been reported in studies describing eukaryotic histones and the e. coli global regulator, protein hu, a known dna-binding protein. operons, such as those of colicins, that encode proteins that can be detrimental to the producing cell are regulated precisely to ensure appropriate timing of synthesis and avoid untimely death of the producer. we can thus speculate that synthesis of usp and its associated imu1- proteins could also be tightly regulated, limiting their production to avoid overt degradation and masking of the producers’ genome. indeed high expression levels of imu are toxic for producing cells. dna-binding proteins usually have an overall positive charge that facilitates their binding to dna. the imu protein, has a theoretical isoelectric point of ca., which implies that the dna-binding region must be localised only on part of the tertiary structure of the molecule. different online dna-binding motif search tools were used to identify a potential imu dna binding motif. the results imply that the dna-binding ability of imu probably originates from the helix-turn-helix motif.  in conclusion, our study shows that imu like the colicin e immunity protein cei, does not form dimers and in addition, does not form a tight complex with the usp protein. however, in contrast to the two other small proteins of the usp pathogenicity island, imu and imu does bind dna and rna. we propose that usp producing cells are protected from genome fragmentation by imu dna masking. further, as imu precipitates but does not damage dna we believe that could have biotechnological potential. "," the escherichia coli uropathogenic-specific protein is a bacteriocin-like genotoxin, active against mammalian cells and associated with e. coli strains that provoke pyelonephritis, prostatitis and bacteraemia. usp is encoded by a small pathogenicity island with three downstream small open reading frames that are believed to provide immunity to the producer. to prevent host suicide, colicins, bacteriocins of e. coli, form tight complexes with their cognate immunity proteins. colicin – immunity protein complexes are among the strongest protein complexes known. here, the usp associated immunity protein was partially characterized to gain insight into its role and mechanism of activity.  isolation and partial characterisation of the usp-associated immunity protein- revealed that, while usp and imu do not form a high affinity complex, imu exhibits dna and rna binding activity. imu was also shown to protect dna against degradation by colicin e  our data infer that nonspecific dna binding of the imu immunity protein, prevents suicide of e. coli producing the genotoxin usp. escherichia coliimu3immunity proteinuropathogenic-specific protein dna/rna binding ",c3238ae3-a3c4-4a7e-90bd-bcc74e391924,pubmed
180," degradation of natural habitats has become a major threat to biodiversity, questioning the survival of a vast number of species. in addition to impoverishment of environment, the loss of species may compromise our own well-being as degradation of habitats may hamper ecosystem function, resulting even in ecosystem collapse. in order to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services international targets have been set not only for slowing down the rate of degradation but also for restoring already degraded ecosystems. in general, ecological restoration aims at reversing the degradation by partial or complete restoration of the original structure and function of the ecosystem. ecosystems with an urgent need for restoration are peatlands which have been, and still are, a subject for different human impacts, such as forestry, peat extraction and agriculture. peatlands cover approximately 3% of the earth’s surface from which a majority, nearly 90%, is found in the northern hemisphere. in finland peatlands have been extensively drained, mainly for forestry purposes: over half of the original peatland area is currently drained. this drastic diminishing of the natural peatland area has resulted in species confined to peatlands classified as threatened. drainage leads to major and rapid changes in the hydrology and chemistry of peatland. water level drops immediately by 20–60 cm resulting in complex changes in the amount and availability of different nutrients, and in decrease of peat ph. consequently, these changes in abiotic conditions have their impact on the vegetation: peatland species confined to wet conditions are replaced by peatland species inhabiting hummocks and species colonizing from the nearby forests. peatland restoration aims at reversing these changes by damming or filling in the ditches with peat and by removing the trees grown after drainage. although studies concerning the long-term effects of these restoration efforts are still scarce reported short-term effects occurring within a few years after restoration are promising: a rapid rise of the water-table and subsequent changes in peat chemistry, and also vegetation community seems to start recovering. however, little is known how other species groups in addition to vascular plants and bryophytes respond to restoration of drained peatlands. odonata are widely used as bioindicators of different freshwater systems as they are sensitive to both local abiotic conditions and surrounding terrestrial landscape. particularly, odonata have been used successfully in some restoration monitoring studies. in finland, there are altogether species of odonata and a handful of these species are restricted to peatlands. in addition, peatlands are habitats also for generalists such as sympetrum danae and libellulla quadrimaculata occupying almost any kind of water. here we studied whether odonata abundance and species richness is influences by drainage and whether they respond to peatland restoration already after three years. since drainage is a severe disturbance that transforms the peatland habitat, it may be expected that drainage has had a negative impact on both the abundance and species richness of odonata. at the short term, restoration may also be considered to be a disturbance and thus the short term impact of the restoration may be expected to be negative as well.  we found altogether individual larvae representing species. the number of individuals found from a site ranged from zero to, and species richness from zero to five. both abundance and species richness was higher in pristine sites than in drained sites. when considering also the first and the third year after restoration, interaction of treatment and year was statistically significant for both abundance and species richness: abundance and species richness of restored sites increases in the third year after restoration. these results were consistent when analysing the data from the areas that had already been visited during the third year after restoration. the effect was due to three of the seven sites visited with relatively high species richness whilst no individuals was found from the rest of the sites.table odonata species found and the mean number of individuals of each species in different sites restored drained pristine before year after

tend to reach an asymptote. moreover, there was variation between the curves between the years in some sites. thus, the sampling could not be taken as exhaustive. in cases where an asymptote seems to be reached the samples represent leucorrhinia dubia which is commonly found in high abundance among the sphagnum mosses. comparing sacs among restored, drained and pristine sites was hindered by the fact that no individuals were found in many of the restored and drained sites. however, in the restored sites where individuals were found sacs lay above the curves of pristine sites suggesting that more species with the same number of individuals was found from the restored sites. discussion our results showed that as expected odonata clearly suffered from peatland drainage as both abundance and species richness of odonata were lower in drained than in pristine sites. the reason for lower abundance and species richness in drained sites may be due to multiple factors: peatland drainage may change either the larval habitat or the surrounding landscape, and the effect may be direct or indirect via their prey. the simplest and the most probable cause for lower odonata abundance in drained sites is the reduction of the available breeding habitat. adult odonata find suitable habitat by visual cues. thus, transformation from bog pools to a ditch with an approximately meter wide water surface may significantly diminish the changes for finding the site or simply reduce its attractiveness. moreover, due to their small size drifts are also susceptible for drying and they may also sustain smaller amount of other invertebrates, lowering the amount of prey for odonata. drainage also changes water quality which may affect odonata, either directly or indirectly via decreasing their prey. particularly, drainage may result in decrease of ph. indeed, ph has been shown to be an important factor affecting odonata community composition. however, the suggested causality has been an indirect effect due to fish predation, and fish are unlikely to occur in bog pools. although odonata in general are relatively tolerant to low ph it may affect survival of some species. in addition to water quality drainage results in inevitable changes in vegetation patterns. this may affect odonata as they use vegetation for multiple purposes such as for hunting or shelter, and a positive relationship between odonata and plant species richness have been found at multiple spatial scales. however, the fact that in some sites odonata species respond rapidly to restoration suggests that vegetation patterns are not at least the main reason for diminished abundance in drained sites as the response of vegetation to restoration are generally rather slow. as expected, during the first summer after restoration no larvae were found from the restored sites. this confirms that the increased abundance and species richness during the third year after restoration are due to new colonizations. thus, odonata are able to rapidly colonize the newly formed pools and seem to benefit from peatland restoration. however, increase of abundance and species richness was found only in three of the seven sites. by contrast, no individuals were found in four of the sites. this may be because just by chance the adults have not yet been able to find the pools. this may be unlikely however, because although landscape structure influences the movements of odonata, the study was conducted on natura sites and the set-up included large areas of pristine peatland very close in the same mire complex acting as a source pool. the other possible reasons that no individuals were found from some restored sites are that either the adults do not find the newly formed pools suitable for egg laying or larvae may still be in so low abundance that they were not detected. in general the odonata larvae were found in very low abundances from the studied peatlands. as the number of species increases with increasing number of individuals and species accumulation curves representing this relationship failed to reach asymptotes, the sampling was not exhaustive enough to reveal the true odonata species richness of the study sites. thus, in order to have a better estimate of absolute species richness of the sites, sampling should have been enhanced. however, our main results are about the relative species richness and abundance among the pristine, drained and restored sites and for this comparison the sampling is robust enough.  to conclude, odonata showed decreased abundance and species richness in drained peatlands compared to pristine ones. thus, drainage cause changes in hydrological and nutrient regimes in peatlands that have consequences not only to vegetation but also to other species groups. as the odonata are top predators in many bog pools, their diminishing may cause cascading effects in other water invertebrates also. fortunately, our results also showed that peatland restoration have potential to lead a relatively rapid recovery of odonata abundance and species richness. "," restoration aims at reversing the trend of habitat degradation, the major threat to biodiversity. in finland, more than half of the original peatland area has been drained, and during recent years, restoration of some of the drained peatlands has been accomplished. short-term effects of the restoration on peatland hydrology, chemistry and vegetation are promising but little is known about how other species groups apart from vascular plants and bryophytes respond to restoration efforts.  here, we studied how abundance and species richness of odonata respond to restoration. we sampled larvae in three sites on each of different study areas. we sampled odonata larvae before restoration, during the first and the third year after restoration and used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effect of restoration. drained sites had lower abundance and species richness than pristine sites. during the third year after restoration both abundance and species richness had risen in restored sites.  our results show that odonata suffer from drainage, but seem to benefit from peatland restoration and are able to colonize newly formed water pools already within three years after restoration. electronic supplementary material the online version of this article contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. keywords ecological restorationdisturbancemiredragonflybiodiversityissue-copyright-statement© the author 2015 ",30b03ed4-7e3d-4a8d-9ab7-9a74d9598658,pubmed
181," novel disease genes remain difficult to identify in most genetic diseases, and in particular, in highly polygenic disorders. currently, not all genes have yet been detected even for those diseases whose molecular mechanisms are partially known, for instance, breast cancer. breast cancer is a common cancer and a major cause of cancer death among females around the world, which makes up 23% of total cancer cases and 14% of cancer deaths. mining breast cancer genes is conducive to understand its pathogenic mechanism and search for effective treatments. with rapid growth of disease-related genomic and functional data, computational approaches can be utilized to mine for new cancer genes. in the past two decades, a number of computational methods had been developed to mine potential disease related genes. most of those methods rank candidate genes based on the idea that proteins similar to each other tend to cause similar or same diseases. they involve setting up a candidate gene set to be compared with a known disease gene set on their physical or functional attributes. on one hand, physical attribute-based methods include screening direct neighbors of known disease genes in the ppi network, comparing shortest path length between candidate genes and known disease genes, clustering or graph partitioning to uncover disease modules in the interaction network. some approaches also used global network features to find genes similar with known disease genes. on the other hand, several methods rely on functional similarities between candidate and disease genes, for example, some methods measured similarity between genes by their functional annotations ). methods using other data sources had also been developed, such as gene expression, biological pathways and sequence features. cancers such as breast cancer are complex and heterogeneous in nature, cancer-related genes often do not function in isolation but interact with one another. integrating multiple data types was found to be effective for gene mining in alleviating problems caused by incomplete information. for instance, endeavour is an online tool based on using multiple data sources. it integrated candidate gene rankings from different data sources into a final ranking with the order statistic algorithm. however, different data categories usually contain inherent noise or systematic errors. for instance, data from computational predictions will no doubt contain some amount of uncertainty. experimental data obtained from different labs or experimental platforms can contain appreciable amount of noise. noise in source data can push computed results away from their true values, lead to erroneous reporting. a better method must be able to tolerate certain amount of noise, which makes the integration of different data sources more applicable to real-life scenarios. despite the fact that some approaches can work with precision when presented with highly accurate data, few studies have shown that those methods worked robustly when faced with increasingly noisy data. a number of papers had discussed the task of balancing noise and precision when using multiple data sources for cancer gene mining, however, hardly anyone had analyzed the noise problem quantitatively. it is important to calibrate how robust a method works with respect to noise, namely, how fast a method deteriorates when percentage of noise in source data goes up. with that knowledge, users can then be confident about the method’s effectiveness when it is applied to real life data sets. to tackle the data noise problem, a novel noise tolerant data fusion approach was proposed here for breast cancer gene mining, which integrated information from ppi network with gene expression data to rank genes based on their probabilities of being breast cancer related. satisfactory results were obtained even when noise level was high. to demonstrate advantages of the proposed method, its performance was compared with that of the random walk method, which utilized a node’s global neighborhood in a network to rank genes. random walk based methods had been shown to produce good performance in gene ranking. results showed the proposed method exhibited better robustness when faced with increasingly noisy data, as compared to the random walk approach.  an effective data integration method was developed to mine breast cancer genes from four major data sources: protein-protein interactions, gene expression data, go annotations, and known breast cancer genes. * for the known breast cancer gene set, three tools were used to perform the enrichment analyses of go terms in the bp sub-ontology: david, goeast, and gostats. david and goeast are web tools; gostats is an r package from bioconductor. cancer-hallmark go terms were extracted from table  of. after removing redundancy, a comprehensive human ppi network was constructed with data obtained from multiple interactions databases. the resultant network contained a total of ppis with genes. a noise tolerant method was designed to rank potential breast cancer genes. rationale for data integration a network-based score and an expression-based score were respectively derived for each gene, which were then integrated into a final score by weighting them with a coefficient λ. a p-score was computed to represent performance of the proposed method when λ was changed from to p-score was the average ranking of known breast cancer genes in top 10% of the final gene ranking list. smaller p-score meant better performance. as shown in figure  better performance was achieved when λ= compared with λ=; the best performance was obtained when λ=, which suggested that utilizing genes’ complex relations in the ppi network can help cancer gene mining tasks. it also confirmed that multiple data sources can complement each other in ranking cancer genes. final ranking results were listed in additional file 1: table s evaluation of performance in ranking known cancer genes known cancer genes were derived from the omim and cgc databases. known breast cancer genes derived from omim was called omimset, those from cgc called cgcset. omimset was used to train the proposed method, and cgcset was used for evaluation. table  showed that the proposed method achieved better performance in ranking known breast cancer genes. counting only genes ranked in top 10%, the proposed method achieved an average ranking of compared with by random walk. counting all genes in cgcset, the proposed method achieved an average ranking of compared with by random walk. robustness with respect to realistic data noise in general, a method based on multiple types of knowledge is more objective than those utilizing singular information; combining independent data sources can alleviate effects of biases inherent in single data types. most data sets, especially genome wide data, tend to contain appreciable amount of noise. for instance, go is a powerful tool which provides a controlled vocabulary to describe biological functions on multiple levels. it was also widely used on cancer research. however, not all go annotations are equally credible. as of october there were over million go annotations for homo sapiens genes. each go annotation includes an evidence code to indicate how the annotation was inferred. all evidence codes are manually assigned. they can be divided into four categories: experimental, computational analysis, author statements, and curatorial statements. for homo sapiens, evidence codes were used to describe go annotations. the vast majority of go annotations were found to be computationally derived and not manually curated. go annotations therefore contain appreciable amount of noise within themselves. approaches that exhibit robust performance with regard to noise are needed if they are to prove useful in cancer gene hunting endeavours. nevertheless, as mentioned before, few projects had specifically analysed data noise effects quantitatively. a network based noise tolerant method was proposed here to mine breast cancer genes. its performance was compared with that of the well performing random walk approach by five-fold cross-validation. the results confirmed the proposed method’s robust performance with respect to data noise. the set of known breast cancer genes was enlarged by including genes sharing go annotations with those in the knownset. the enlarged set was called the goset, which was adopted as a noisy set of likely breast cancer genes. the goset was utilized to check an algorithm’s robustness with respect to data noise. data were sampled from the goset, and combined with the knowset to generate a noisy set of training data. this way of synthesizing noisy data set is unique in that it doesn’t simply using random data as noise, which is too artificial. the goset contains enriched but still imperfect data, which can better mimic data noise in real life scenarios. an algorithm’s ability to retain its performance was checked when fraction of noisy data in the training set went up. the proposed method did not work quite as well as random walk approach when input data was 100% accurate, however, when noise level in input data increased, we observed the following phenomena. random walk approach exhibited a sharp decrease in its performance, while our method was able to maintain a relatively stable performance. when noise increased to a large extent, the proposed method was able to perform about twice as well as random walk approach did. it can thus be stated that the proposed method was more robust with respect to noise in input data, compared to the state-of-art random walk based approach. the results also confirmed the power of data integration, which was able to let different data sets complementing each other. robustness with respect to completely random noise goset tried to simulate realistic data noise. however, it might be suspected that goset was biased toward the proposed method in one way or another. to make sure the comparison between the proposed method and the random walk approach was not done unfairly, randomly picked genes were added to the knownset, and performances of the proposed method and random walk approach were then compared. figure  again showed that random walk approach showed linear performance decline when noise increased in the source data, while the proposed method was able to maintain stable performance.  cancers are highly complex processes, the majority of cancer genes are yet to be mapped. currently available data are too limited to be really effective for cancer gene searching purpose. broadening the scope of input data should enable better use of available data to mine for new cancer genes. approaches that work robustly against data noise are needed. a novel noise tolerant breast cancer gene mining method was presented here, which integrated a comprehensive ppi network, gene expression data, prior knowledge of breast cancer and go annotations to rank potential breast cancer genes. from each data source, a ranked list for each candidate gene was computed, and they were then combined into a final ranking order. influence of data noise was quantitatively evaluated. random walk approach performed better than the proposed method using 100% accurate input data. however, the proposed method showed much greater noise tolerance. to our best knowledge, this is the first effort to quantitatively analyse noise tolerance between different cancer gene mining methods. the framework of the proposed mining method and the quantitative way of appraising noise effects are flexible enough to be useful for other data sources, and hopefully, lead to more discussions on data noise issue for different computational methods in cancer gene mining field. "," mining novel breast cancer genes is an important task in breast cancer research. many approaches prioritize candidate genes based on their similarity to known cancer genes, usually by integrating multiple data sources. however, different types of data often contain varying degrees of noise. for effective data integration, it’s important to design methods that work robustly with respect to noise.  gene ontology annotations were often utilized in cancer gene mining works. however, the vast majority of go annotations were computationally derived, thus not completely accurate. a set of genes annotated with breast cancer enriched go terms was adopted here as a set of source data with realistic noise. a novel noise tolerant approach was proposed to rank candidate breast cancer genes using noisy source data within the framework of a comprehensive human protein-protein interaction network. performance of the proposed method was quantitatively evaluated by comparing it with the more established random walk approach. results showed that the proposed method exhibited better performance in ranking known breast cancer genes and higher robustness against data noise than the random walk approach. when noise started to increase, the proposed method was able to maintained relatively stable performance, while the random walk approach showed drastic performance decline; when noise increased to a large extent, the proposed method was still able to achieve better performance than random walk did.  a novel noise tolerant method was proposed to mine breast cancer genes. compared to the well established random walk approach, it showed better performance in correctly ranking cancer genes and worked robustly with respect to noise within source data. to the best of our knowledge, it’s the first such effort to quantitatively analyze noise tolerance between different breast cancer gene mining methods. the sorted gene list can be valuable for breast cancer research. the proposed quantitative noise analysis method may also prove useful for other data integration efforts. it is hoped that the current work can lead to more discussions about influence of data noise on different computational methods for mining disease genes. networkbreast cancerdata noisenoise tolerance ",30d76025-58ec-4e33-8e77-78d31ee83173,pubmed
182," this paper introduces a flexible and loosely coupled data management system for high throughput sequencing experiments. the system is designed to face the challenges of research, and is required as the versatility and applicability of high throughput sequencing experiments is growing rapidly. the system can be overlaid on top of existing software, and can be used to integrate different specialized algorithms. there already exist a number of commercial solutions, and non-commercial solutions for the management and analysis of high throughput sequencing information. the main drawback to these solutions is that they focus on providing static ""one stop shop"" solutions, which are designed to fit known markets, using well-established methods. while these static systems are useful for non-technical researchers in a production science environment, they lack flexibility for the research scientist who wishes to use cutting edge methods and tools. the existing systems tend to focus on well-established applications for high throughput sequencing: experiments where the technology is seen as a more accurate ""digital"" equivalent to microarrays, experiments to determine protein binding, or large scale genome assembly projects. however, high throughput sequencing has the potential of becoming ubiquitous across many avenues of investigation. this potential is due to both an increase in our understanding of systems biology and the capabilities of the new generation of instruments. as the field is constantly evolving new discoveries are continually being made, including new medically related functionality of small rnas, new families of rna, and signaling through extra-cellular rnas. new techniques and instruments are also being developed that provide insight into these new facets, due to an increase in throughput and sophistication. for these reasons, any sequencing software infrastructure used in the research environment must be easily adaptable. by this we mean it must have the ability to be readily changed for new usage. for example, we can expect each research area to require different mechanisms for normalization and replication strategies, sample and experiment vocabularies, and analysis algorithms. generally within research each project requires a large amount of de novo analysis development and customization to support: new technology strategies such as allowing for multiplexing or integrating with new instrumentation; informatics strategies, to allow for data and system integration; and new computational strategies, to support analysis and data-mining tasks. additionally, each laboratory will have their own demands in terms of experiment qa, annotations and integration with processes and integration with other data types. therefore, it is important that the research community have access to a system that is: • open. the system must be distributed as an open software project as many users will need to modify the system to meet their specific needs. • standardized. the system should follow widely used standards for both software development and data exchange. this will ensure that the code base will be easier to maintain and have greater connectivity with external systems and tools. • adaptable. the system must be easily adaptable without requiring a detailed understanding of the aspects of the internal software architecture. in this way, significant modifications can be implemented efficiently and quickly. • deployable. the system must be easy to rapidly deploy and modify. a system that is cumbersome or overly complex wastes the end user's development time with unnecessary setup and technical details. seqadapt follows these principles, and provides a standardized and modular architecture which is easy to use, adapt and maintain. the underlying enterprise architecture, addama has been designed to provide the adaptability required to enable the rapid development needed within research driven science. implementation to meet the demands of researchers we have developed seqadapt, a solution that is able to: scale to meet the requirements of the research environment, use best practices for mainstay applications, and be readily adapted to new usage. the system is built using a general software infrastructure to support adaptable data management. seqadapt integrates external sample tracking software, workflows for executing analyses and robust data management to provide a modular and adaptable system for high throughput sequencing experiments. due to the data volumes involved with high throughput sequencing a software infrastructure is often required to facilitate storage, management and analysis. we have used the addama system to provide the necessary support for the creation of a workflow encompassing the entire process that is complete, lightweight and easily adapted to changing requirements. this solution allows for changes in the underlying sequencing technology while still providing the ability to plug in new processing methods. a pluggable architecture is important as the technology, data formats, and processing methods are changing rapidly in the field of sequencing. performance and the ability to scale up as datasets grow in size is also a requirement with the management of sequencing data. to allow for flexible deployment, we use a service oriented architecture, where distributed services provide the required functions. as these services grow, they can be deployed on the appropriate computational infrastructure.  the seqadapt default download consists of a preconfigured bundle of services. each of these services can be interchanged with alternative implementations. additionally the underlying system makes it possible to develop custom applications, and to rapidly integrate new analysis tools. the software infrastructure is comprised of three main services: a sample tracking system, a data management system and a process management system. the sample tracking system's functionality includes sample submission, annotation with controlled vocabularies and file management. the data management system uses addama to organize the data and to trigger new analyses. the process management system is a lightweight and generic system for executing processing pipelines and persisting inputs and outputs. the addama robot allows for analyses to be run directly on a dedicated machine which has been configured for a specific analysis. typically the analyses are run on either a server machine or, if the analysis is still under in-house development, on the specific developers computer. the robot is responsible for monitoring jobs and the transparent transportation of required data between the repository and the analysis environment. the data management system uses standard open technologies including: content repositories which are used to generically store all experimental information; information indexing services, which provide for search capabilities across all data and metadata stored; and service registries, which allow for run-time discovery of different content repositories and associated services. addama also provides an abstraction so that a set of interlinked content repositories can be accessed through a single web application layer. this layer is exposed with a json based restful web service. the process management system coordinates jobs using a java message service. with this configuration, the system can scale from a single computer to a distributed set of execution agents on multiple servers to listening to a jms message queue. all components of the seqadapt system are loosely coupled to allow for easy replacement with alternative systems. these alternative systems could include different sample tracking systems different persistence stores and different analysis tools. this system allows for rapid integration of scientific algorithms using the standardized addama framework. the integration system is designed to be flexible, and allows for any command line analysis tools to be ""plugged in"". the framework is suited for developing small-scale analyses as well as for large scale processing that requires scaled-up distribution. further, all components needed for this system are provided in an easy-to-install package. the default download for seqadapt has been set up for chip-seq analysis, and will process data from the illumina genome analyzer ii using the macs algorithm. the default install allows the user to submit an analysis, monitor its progress, and then view the result files. integrating new analyses as discussed above, the enterprise system can be extended in a number of ways. as the system is based upon distributed loosely coupled services, these services can be replaced with ones offering the same interface. each of the major components are built against technology standards. new analysis pipelines can be added by writing a mapping module and then registering the analysis with addama. a benefit of the addama systems is that a script can execute in a preexisting development environment, eliminating the time consuming task of replicating software installations on a processing server. when algorithms have reached a mature state and are used widely, the system scales up to have the execution agent installed on many servers. a key benefit of this system is that it manages all of the non-scientific functionality needed in this type of processing. this freedom from writing boilerplate infrastructure code allows the computational biologist to focus on developing the needed scientific software. the addama robot allows for the rapid integration of these tools in a relatively short period of time. integration of these tools requires that the developer has a rudimentary understanding of addama, and also understands how the specific analysis tool works. by way of example we have integrated the erange rna-seq analysis tool. once erange was installed the integration work was completed in less than a day. any analysis script that can be run from the command line can be integrated in the same manner. the steps involved in such integration are: define input location. this is done by providing a command-line executable wrapper script. this script will define all of the inputs to the erange analysis and execute it. it will read the inputs from a local json file downloaded from the addama service by the robot. control outputs by configuring the wrapper script to write all results to an ""/outputs"" directory. this directly will be in the same location as the script, the creation of the directory will be handled by the robot as well. similarly any log information should be written to a ""/log"" directory. register the script by configuring the addama robot. the robot uses a properties file that defines the wrapper script that is to be executed, and a local path where each run will be output. update these properties to reflect the locations of the erange script and the directory where it write inputs, outputs and log messages. enable user submissions. to make submitting simple for the user, an optional web application may be developed. this application will take the expected inputs and send them to the addama system via the rest interface. this same page can also be used to query addama for the results of the robot analysis and display those for the user as well. the robot automates the tasks that are required to integrate the analysis with the enterprise system. when the analysis is triggered the robot is responsible for the delivery of the inputs to the analysis, starting the analysis and monitoring the outputs. when completed the outputs, and any associated logs are loaded back, into addama. walkthrough a walk-through showing the default workflow for seqadapt is given in figures, and this walk-through shows how the system can be used to capture information about a chip-seq experiment, store the results and then analyze the reads using macs.  the default system can be used ""as-is"" to support chip-seq analysis, however it can also be rapidly customized to suit new usage. the requirement for such flexibility is due to the fact that it is rarely possible to foresee all the usages with which a new instrument technology, such as high throughput sequencing, will be applied. to be able to meet the requirements of a rapidly evolving research environment, as is found in most scientific institutions, an adaptable data management system is required. the modular framework described in this article is designed to provide such adaptability. the major advantage of the seqadapt/addama system is that ""ad hoc"" tools can be rapidly integrated. in this instance ""ad hoc"" means tools that do not adhere to predefined standards and have been built without integration in mind. the system is available from the institute for systems biology's informatics web site, as: a demonstration system running as a web application, a preconfigured install for quick deployment and as a full download containing

"," high throughput sequencing has become an increasingly important tool for biological research. however, the existing software systems for managing and processing these data have not provided the flexible infrastructure that research requires.  existing software solutions provide static and well-established algorithms in a restrictive package. however as high throughput sequencing is a rapidly evolving field, such static approaches lack the ability to readily adopt the latest advances and techniques which are often required by researchers. we have used a loosely coupled, service-oriented infrastructure to develop seqadapt. this system streamlines data management and allows for rapid integration of novel algorithms. our approach also allows computational biologists to focus on developing and applying new methods instead of writing boilerplate infrastructure code.  the system is based around the addama service architecture and is available at our website as a demonstration web application, an installable single download and as a collection of individual customizable services.

183," streptococcus uberis is an important cause of mastitis in modern dairy herds. it is responsible for a significant proportion of clinical and subclinical infections in both lactating and nonlactating cows. s. uberis is considered as an environmental mastitis pathogen in that it has a ubiquitous and widespread distribution in the cow's environment. indeed, streptococcus uberis can be isolated from bedding and pasture, as well as intramammary and extramammary sites on the cow. this may contribute to the poor efficiency of recommended mastitis control measures toward this pathogen, such as teat dipping and intramammary antimicrobial therapy at the end of each lactation period. the main route of transmission appears to be from environmental sources but recent epidemiological studies suggest that cow-to-cow transmission is likely to be occurring. understanding the different sources, the dynamics of spread and transmission of s. uberis is a prerequisite for the development of mastitis control programs. in an attempt to differentiate s. uberis strains, a number of typing methods have been developed, among them restriction endonuclease fingerprinting, random amplified polymorphic dna, repetitive extragenic palindromic -pcrs and dna macrorestriction analysis by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. all these methods enlighted the high genomic diversity of s. uberis strains but most of them display limitations in terms of discriminatory power, standardization and reproducibility. pfge is reliable, reproducible and highly discriminatory but its use in large epidemiological studies and routine surveillance is limited because it is technically demanding, time-consuming, expensive and complex dna patterns may be difficult to interpret, especially for large collections of isolates. recently, two multilocus sequence typing systems were described for s. uberis subtyping. the first one, based on four housekeeping genes and two virulence genes, was evaluated with s. uberis isolates and compared to ribotyping and rapd typing. mlst was superior to the other techniques in terms of discriminatory power, concordance with epidemiological data, and quantitative information regarding relatedness of isolates. the other mlst system relies on the use of sequences from seven housekeeping gene fragments. it was used to study s. uberis isolates from united kingdom and new zealand. these two populations were shown to be distinct and three major clonal complexes with different geographic prevalences have been identified. this method is suitable for the analysis of s. uberis population structure and evolutionary relationships and a database has been constructed on a central mlst web site. however, mlst may not be suitable for routine surveillance and local epidemiological studies because of the high cost and the necessity of access to a high-throughput dna sequencing facility. polymorphic tandem repeat typing is a new generic technology which has been proved to be very efficient for bacterial pathogens such as b. anthracis, m. tuberculosis, p. aeruginosa, y. pestis and is compatible with the development of internet-based resources. it takes advantage of the release of genome sequence data for the identification of tandem repeats. the development of an assay then requires the evaluation of tandem repeats polymorphism, i.e. tandem repeats showing interindividual length polymorphism, on well-selected sets of isolates. by using different polymorphic tandem repeats, it is possible to discriminate strains for a low cost with ordinary molecular biology equipment and the data can be easily exchanged and compared. this method, called multiple locus vntr analysis, has been recently applied to several bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli o157:h. mlva can evolve with resources as fragment size, repetition number of tandem repeat can be determined by capillary electrophoresis with a dna analyzer, as well as nucleotidic sequence. the aim of the present study was to identify polymorphic tandem repeats in s. uberis genomes that could be included in a mlva procedure able to differentiate isolates and to contribute to the comprehension of s. uberis epidemiology and ecology in dairy herds.  the genome sequence of s.uberis strain 0140j was explored with the tandem repeats finder software using the advanced version with default parameters. in these conditions, twenty-seven tandem repeats with a maximal unit length of bp were detected around the chromosome. two tandem repeats displaying a period size smaller than bp were not considered in this study, although one of them is comprised in tr this choice was motivated by the relative ease with which allelic differences can be resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. among the trs studied, the lowest value of nucleotide sequence identity between individual repeat units was 72% and copy numbers of repeat units in s. uberis 0140j genome varied from to. twelve trs had a repeat unit length with multiples of and all of them, except tr were embedded in predicted open reading frames according to the current preliminary gene prediction and s. uberis blast server. trs and were partially contained in orfs and displayed the start and stop codons, respectively, while tr contained a putative small orf. other trs were localized in non-coding regions of the genome. a set of epidemiologically unrelated s. uberis isolates, i.e. collected at different times in herds from diverse french areas, were used to evaluate the size polymorphism of the trs by pcr with specific primers. overlapping or adjoining trs, namely trs and and and and and were co-amplified with a single set of primers. a total of trs were found to be polymorphic as diverse size amplicons were obtained but two of them were amplified for a minority of isolates. these trs were not investigated further. the seven polymorphic trs for which amplicons were obtained for all isolates were used to type the entire set of strains. these polymorphic trs are the followings: trs 11+ and with the exception of tr which may be part of an orf, all polymorphic trs were localized in intergenic regions. among the monomorphic trs, tr6+ and tr were not amplified in all isolates. the inability to amplify tr6+ tr tr16+ or tr for some strains may be due to a local genetic variability in the area annealing with primers or to the absence of the corresponding sequences in their genomes. mlva typing of the entire set of s. uberis isolates was performed with the seven selected trs. the set of alleles obtained with these trs is presented in figure a total of mlva types were obtained with types among the strains isolated from the milk of cows belonging to our experimental herd, and types for the epidemiologically unrelated strains, i.e. collected in different herds and areas. with the exception of the s. parauberis strain ncdo all the isolates used in the study were defined as s. uberis according to pcr amplification results using primers targeting species-specific parts of the 16s rrna gene as previously described. this confirmed that the occurence of s. parauberis as causative agent of bovine mastitis appears to be rare. the s. parauberis strain ncdo was the sole strain for which no amplification occurred with most of the trs. this result is probably the consequence of some genetic variability and it would be interesting to determine if this variability is specific to the ncdo strain or if it represents a general feature of s. parauberis genotype. concerning other major streptococcus species implicated in bovine mastitis, i.e.streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae, none of the polymorphic trs were amplified from the genomic dna preparations of the strains that we tested. moreover, no significant alignments of the trs sequences with available s. agalactiae genomic sequences were found when a blast analysis was performed. the mlva system described in this study displayed a satisfactory discriminatory power as it was able to distinguish most of the s. uberis isolates collected in different herds or from the cows belonging to our experimental herd. these results are in agreement with previous studies that showed, using diverse typing methods, the high genetic variability of s. uberis strains. the isolates collected from of the cows in our experimental herd were divided into mlva types with types represented by isolates collected from the milk of different cows. strains isolated simultaneously from different quarters of individual cows harboured different mlva types. these observations are congruent with previous reports stating that the environment rather than infected mammary glands was the likely source of s. uberis infections, even if cow to cow transmission could occur. overall, the s. uberis strains used in this study were classified in mlva types among them comprised strains that were isolated in different herds and years. even if some s. uberis strains isolated in different herds and countries have already been demonstrated to belong to the same type using methods such as pfge or mlst, the strains belonging to mlva types and may be distinguished with another typing method or additional trs. indeed, s. uberis strains harbouring the same alleles in a mlst study appeared to be different using pvuii ribotyping and some strains belonging to the same pvuii ribotype were considered different using mlst. the mlva system described here has already a high discriminatory power but, considering the variability of s. uberis genotype, it would be interesting to look for additional polymorphic trs to complete this set. among the trs used, tr11+ and tr were the most efficient with a simpsons diversity index of and, respectively. sequencing of amplicons corresponding to tr11+ showed that tr and tr are both polymorphic and that some strains may harbour only one of them. indeed, the sequence analysis of one representative of allele revealed that tr was not contained in the genome of the corresponding strain. tr tr and tr exhibited a simpsons diversity index value of, and, respectively. tr and tr were the less discriminatory. indeed, tr displayed only alleles with our strains and tr allowed us to define alleles but most of the strains possessed the allelic forms or  this investigation validates the usefulness of the mlva typing method for bovine s. uberis strains and a first set of markers. the proposed mlva system can be evaluated with collections of strains from diverse geographical origins, completed by additional polymorphic tandem repeats and compared with other typing methods. in contrast to pfge or mlst, the mlva method is easy and fast to perform, low cost and could constitute the method of choice for short-term epidemiological studies when population structure and evolutionary relationships are not a concern. investigations at the herd level such as analysis of outbreaks, strains implicated in persistent infections or demonstrating different antibiotic treatment susceptibilities, should be facilitated and allow the development of adapted herd management measures. "," streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis and recommended control measures, based on improved milking practice, teat dipping and antibiotic treatment at drying-off, are poorly efficient against this environmental pathogen. a simple and efficient typing method would be helpful in identifying s.uberis sources, virulent strains and cow to cow transmission. the potential of mlva for s. uberis mastitis isolates genotyping was investigated.  the genomic sequence of streptococcus uberis was analyzed for potential variable number tandem repeats. twenty-five tandem repeats were identified and amplified by pcr with dna samples from s. uberis strains. a set of seven trs were found to be polymorphic and used for mlva typing of s. uberis isolates. a total of mlva types were obtained with types among strains isolated from the milk of mastitic cows belonging to our experimental herd, and types for epidemiologically unrelated strains, i.e. collected in different herds and areas.  the mlva method can be applied to s. uberis genotyping and constitutes an interesting complement to existing typing methods. this method, which is easy to perform, low cost and can be used in routine, could facilitate investigations of the epidemiology of s. uberis mastitis in dairy cows.

184," the structural genomics consortium aims to populate protein fold space using high-throughput experimental technologies. as a result the number of known structures in the protein data bank is increasing rapidly every year and currently holds structures. this highlights the importance of the need for fast and reliable protein structure comparison methods. there are various methods which use detailed 3d structures for comparison; ssap uses a double dynamic programming method that takes into account several different features of protein structure including phi/psi angles, accessibility and inter-residue vectors to align two protein structures. other approaches include stamp, dali and the combinatorial extension method. on the other hand abstract level structural comparison methods are based on topological/vector models of secondary structure elements and their relationships. vast is a vector based protein structure comparison method. grath is a graph-based algorithm that compares the axial vectors of alpha helices and beta strands of two proteins, together with the distances, angles and chirality between these vectors. it is based on a method by grindley et al.. earlier work by koch et al. uses a graph method to find maximal common sses in a pair of proteins. tops is a graph-based method applied to the topological representation of the protein structures. although these methods perform very fast protein structure comparison in most cases the results have significantly less biological interpretation due to the abstract nature of the protein model. moreover, the functional annotation problem is made much more complex by the fact that the number of protein folds is limited while their range of functions is very diverse. for example, the current version of the scop database classified the tim barrels protein fold into distinct functional superfamilies. this motivated our research to develop a novel topological model for protein structures, enhanced with structural and biochemical features, such as ligand interaction information and amino acid sequence length of the secondary structures, in order to permit better, more biologically significant comparison methods. previously, we have discussed the basic mechanisms of our novel tops+ comparison method for novel topological models. we compute the edit distance between two proteins based on tops+ strings elements using a dynamic programming approach. we have benchmarked our method with an all-against-all pairwise comparison using a large dataset of non-redundant structures from the pdb and the results were validated using the standard scop superfamily classification numbers. we have also compared our method against other methods and showed that it is faster than ssap, fatcat, dali and tops and that it has a comparable performance against tops. recently we developed the tops++fatcat system that exploits the tops+ strings comparison method to speedup the fatcat protein structural alignment program for fast flexible structural alignment, while preserving the accuracy of the original fatcat method. these promising results have facilitated the introduction of further constraints on ligand-arc matching. in this paper, we show how the above results can be significantly improved using parameter optimization at two stages of the tops+ method: in the generation of the dynamic programming table and in the computation of the comparison score using a compression measure. the dynamic programming algorithm includes weight tables for matching tops+ strings elements, the match scores take into account not only the ssetype, orientation but in addition they include scores for total in/out/ligand arcs together with their arc types such as right and left chiralities, and parallel and anti-parallel hydrogen-bonds. this research work involved generating the tops descriptions enhanced with in/out/ligand arc information for a large set of proteins; designing the weight tables; optimization of weights in the table; designing a pairwise comparison metric based on a compression measure and optimizing different parameters to take into account the variability on both components of the topological and ligand interaction features. the optimization of our advanced tops+ comparison method was carried out on the pdb representative dataset. furthermore, we assess the biological significance of our method against existing protein structure comparison methods based on cluster analysis and validation using an f-measure calculation on the chew-kedem dataset.  analysis of results for the pdb dataset auc/f-measure values for all the comparison methods for the pdb dataset. in alpha+beta class our advtops+ method has a 90% accuracy, which is superior when compared with both tops and our basic tops+ method, which have only 84% accuracy. because these proteins are composed of segregated alpha and beta regions the structure-dependent ligand interactions and additional chiral, hydrogen bonds are also present. thus our parameter optimization can handle all arcs more efficiently. on the other hand, the alpha/beta class of proteins contains mixed alpha and beta secondary structures; more importantly although the protein domains from these classes have ligand interactions, they may not be structure-dependent ligand interactions. in these classes for most of the protein superfamilies the ligands have a tendency to bind the clefts or binding pocket which have appropriate physiochemical properties and the correct conformational geometry of the amino acids. furthermore it is important to note that in our tops+ and advtops+ comparison methods we have considered only the total number of ligand-arcs rather than the actual ligand property match, thus we have false positives in some scop classes. in the case of all-beta class proteins our advtops+ method has comparable performance against tops with 87% accuracy; in this class proteins contain a significant number of hydrogen bond and chiral arcs, and thus parameter optimization is performed more efficiently. from the f-measure statistical evaluation analysis we found that the advtops+ method appears to always do better than tops and tops+ except for the alpha/beta class of proteins. the overall results show that our advtops+ method exhibits substantial improvement compared to basic tops+. it has better performance for all-alpha and alpha+beta proteins compared to tops. on the other scop classes the performance is comparable with tops. since our method considers only the total number of ligand arcs rather than the actual ligand property this leads to false positives to some extent. our advtops+ method can efficiently recognize structure-dependent ligand interactions appropriately in the case of dna-binding proteins and metal binding proteins. analysis of results for the chew-kedem dataset our advanced tops+ comparison method outperforms all the other methods and groups representative proteins from five fold families into biologically significant clusters. in figure each protein domain is represented in the following format ""domainname_foldfamilies"". the tags of the ""foldfamilies"" represents protein structures from five different protein folds; where tb = tim barrel, g = globins, ab = alpha beta, b = all beta, and a = all alpha protein families. the clusters obtained from our advanced tops+ method show that all of the protein domains are grouped according to their structural fold and biological significance except d1ct9a. the basic tops+ method also groups most of the protein domains into correct fold families except for an all beta protein d1cdb__ and two protein domains d2hbg__, d1hlm__ from globins which are grouped together with all alpha proteins. in comparison both the tops and ssap methods produce clusters in which there are many wrongly grouped domains. the quantitative analysis using the f-measure calculation results in more than 98% accuracy for our advtops+ method, which is higher than ssap, tops and basic tops+. when we compare our advtops+ with our basic tops+ method we have achieved a 5% improvement based on parameter optimization. f-measure of the clusters obtained from different protein structure comparison methods. one interesting example from our cluster analysis is that of the asparagine synthetase b, c-terminal domain d1ct9a which is grouped by the advanced tops+ method with the tim barrel domains. table provides advanced tops+ comparison scores for d1ct9a against those protein domains belonging to alpha-beta and tim-barrel fold families, together with their sses length and lcs pattern length. interestingly, d1ct9a has a smaller distance score against all of the tim-barrel proteins compared to alpha-beta protein domains; specifically, for the xylose isomerase protein d6xia__. when we closely checked the 3d structure of d1ct9a we found that it has alpha helices in its n-terminal domain and it contains half tim-barrel like structures in its c-terminal domain. this suggests that a sub-domain of the d1ct9a exhibits a structural drift between the alpha-beta fold and the tim-barrel fold. the structural drift is a special case of gregariousness as described by. since our tops+ method is based on an abstraction of protein structure in the form of sses and topological features without any geometrical properties it is able to perform matching at the fold level and to include most of the sses which are common to two protein structures. advtops+ comparison scores for alpha-beta and tim-barrel folds in the chew-kedem dataset.  in this paper we have reported the generation of tops+ and tops+ strings models for large datasets and have presented an improved tops+ comparison method using parameter optimization both for the computation of the dynamic programming table and the computation of the comparison score using a compression metric. through our evaluation analysis we have showed that our advanced tops+ comparison method has a substantial improvement on all the scop classes compared to our basic tops+ method. our advanced tops+ method has better performance compared to tops on alpha+beta and all-alpha and is comparable on all-beta and alpha/beta. on the chew-kedem dataset our advanced tops+ comparison outperforms all the other methods. this demonstrates that our tops+ and tops+ strings models can find more biologically significant results and has led to interesting new directions to incorporate ligand-pattern discovery in tops+ comparison. our method is faster than tops and ssap because it has time complexity o, where n represents the number of sses in the protein domains. this research opens new doors to an exciting improvement to our tops+ models and advanced tops+ comparison method by the addition of features such as amino-acid sequences, biochemical properties of the protein-ligand interaction at atomic level, and arc scores for each sse. moreover we can improve the comparison process with additional statistical scoring values for each tops+ strings element match both at the micro and the macro level. furthermore our novel tops+ models, tops+ strings and comparison approaches could be applicable to different problem areas such as rna secondary structure comparison and prediction. most of the drug-discovery process starts with in-silico chemical compound screening which is computationally expensive. our tops+ comparison approach could be applied as an initial step to prune the search space and filter the proteins into same folds interacting with similar or different ligands and different folds interacting with similar or different ligands. "," although methods based on highly abstract descriptions of protein structures, such as vast and tops, can perform very fast protein structure comparison, the results can lack a high degree of biological significance. previously we have discussed the basic mechanisms of our novel method for structure comparison based on our tops+ model. in this paper we show how these results can be significantly improved using parameter optimization, and we call the resulting optimised tops+ method as advanced tops+ comparison method i.e. advtops+.  we have developed a tops+ string model as an improvement to the tops graph model by considering loops as secondary structure elements in addition to helices and strands, representing ligands as first class objects, and describing interactions between sses, and sses and ligands, by incoming and outgoing arcs, annotating sses with the interaction direction and type. benchmarking results of an all-against-all pairwise comparison using a large dataset of non-redundant structures from the pdb dataset demonstrate the biological significance, in terms of scop classification at the superfamily level, of our tops+ comparison method.  our advanced tops+ comparison shows better performance on the pdb dataset compared to our basic tops+ method, giving 90% accuracy for scop alpha+beta; a 6% increase in accuracy compared to the tops and basic tops+ methods. it also outperforms the tops, basic tops+ and ssap comparison methods on the chew-kedem dataset, achieving 98% accuracy. software availability the tops+ comparison server is available at http://balabio.dcs.gla.ac.uk/mallika/webtops/.

185," gene knock out technology is widely used to study gene function in vivo, however in some cases constitutive gene deletion is either lethal or deleterious for embryonic development precluding analysis of the adult organism. in these instances it is necessary to induce gene deletion in a tissue specific or time specific manner. tissue specific gene knock out models are most often constructed using the cre-lox recombination system. for this, the sequence of interest is flanked by loxp sites and conditional deletion is achieved by tissue specific expression of the cre recombinase enzyme. due to variability in cre recombinase expression however, deletion of the gene of interest is frequently incomplete. in such cases the tissue of interest would consist of a mixture of cells containing either the functional allele or the truncated allele. clearly, the ratio of 2lox containing cells to 1lox containing cells can have a profound impact on the outcome of the experiment. also, in many cases the ratio of these two cell types can change over time, particularly in regenerating tissues, causing additional variability in the phentotype. in the worst case the presence of cells with the functional 2lox allele can fully mask the effect of the gene deletion. for example if tumors are detected following the conditional deletion of a tumor relevant enzyme it is possible that such tumors are formed by residual 2lox cells. therefore to better understand the phenotype of such experiments it is imperative to accurately measure the relative presence of 1lox and 2lox alleles at various time points of the study. the conventional approach to determine the ratio of 1lox to 2lox alleles is southern blotting. this method however is time consuming, requires large amounts of dna and has a relatively low sensitivity and low dynamic range. therefore alternative methods such as competitive endpoint pcr and emlpa have also been used. however since many laboratories routinely use real-time pcr for quantitative rna or dna sequence analysis we decided to develop a real-time pcr based assay to measure 1lox/2lox allele ratios. we here present a universally applicable probe based real-time pcr protocol that allows accurate quantification of 1lox/2lox allele ratios in genomic dna. this assay is conveniently adaptable to all models using cre-lox mediated gene recombination. in addition we demonstrate and discuss potential pitfalls in particular when using sybr green based protocols.  to evaluate the role of dna methyltransferase 3a in tumorigenesis we induced conditional deletion of dnmt3a ) in intestinal epithelial cells of apc mice using a cre recombinase transgene under control of the modified fatty acid binding protein promoter ). as published previously, fabpl4× at -132-cre mediated gene deletion in epithelial cells of the intestinal tract is incomplete. it was therefore necessary to quantify the ratio of the functional dnmt3a 2lox allele and the truncated dnmt3a 1lox allele in the intestinal mucosa and in intestinal tumors of transgenic mice. to allow processing of large sample numbers with small amounts of dna we tested whether 1lox/2lox allele ratios could be measured using a real-time pcr based assay testing of sybr green based real-time pcr for analysis of conditional gene deletion to allow analysis of gene deletion using sybr green based real-time pcr we designed primers allowing specific amplification of the 1lox and 2lox allele repectively. as illustrated in figure 1a positioning of the 2lox specific primers is comparatively easy because they can be placed anywhere within the potentially deleted region. however it has to be considered that in some cases the excised gene fragment can persist, particularly in non-proliferating tissue after initiation of cre expression. therefore in such cases - in tissues with low mitotic activity and shortly after induction of cre expression - 2lox primer placement in analogy to figure 2a might be preferable. when designing 1lox specific primers, care has to be taken to place them within unique genomic sequences flanking the remaining loxp site of the truncated 1lox allele. however, when following this approach to quantify conditional dnmt3a deletion in our mice we noted the continuous presence of a double peak in the melting curve of the 1lox reaction. this double peak persisted even when choosing different annealing temperatures, multiple alternative primer pairs for the 1lox reaction, different primer concentrations and different dna concentrations. since the presence of two peaks in the melting curve of sybr green based real-time pcr assays frequently indicates the presence of two different amplicons we analyzed the resulting pcr product using both gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. surprisingly, although we had observed two peaks in the melting curve analysis, we could identify only one distinctive pcr product. furthermore when we size selected the pcr product using gel purification to exclude primers and alternative products and repeated the melting curve analysis we reproduced the same double peak, suggesting that the amplified sequence itself was responsible for this aberrant signal. a possible explanation for this observation is that the palindromic loxp sequence motif could serve as a core motif that promotes annealing of sense/sense and antisense/antisense strands or possibly the formation of hairpins. such hybridization products/hairpins would have a lower melting temperature than antisense/sense hybrids and therefore contribute to a second peak in melting curve analysis. since the melting curve is critical for quality control in sybr green assays, data with an aberrant double peak are frequently excluded from further analysis. our example illustrates that sybr green based assays are not only limited by possible amplification and measurement of nonspecific pcr products but are also potentially affected by alternate re-annealing or secondary structures of the specific pcr product itself. in agreement with our own data, difficulties with sybr green based analysis of 1lox/2lox allele ratios have also been reported independently. to resolve such potential difficulties of sybr green based analysis of loxp containing sequences we therefore developed an alternative assay to quantify 1lox/2lox allele ratios using a probe based real-time pcr approach. our aim was to establish a universal probe that could be used for all reactions and models of cre-lox mediated gene deletion such that only the flanking primer sequences need to be adapted. such an assay would combine the convenience of a sybr green based assay with the specificity of a probe based assay. testing of probe based real-time pcr for analysis of conditional gene deletion to establish a probe based assay for the 1lox and 2lox reaction respectively we selected a hydrolysis probe that specifically binds to the loxp site itself and designed primers flanking the loxp site as illustrated in figure 2a. the use of a probe covering the loxp site allowed us to use the same probe for both the 1lox and lox reaction. to generate allele specific standards that would allow us to validate the assay and test its accuracy we cloned 1lox and 2lox specific pcr products into a ta vector and verified resulting clones by sequencing. to generate standards for real-time pcr we then released allele specific fragments by restriction digest and mixed the fragments at variable molar ratios. the resulting 1lox/2lox standards were verified using capillary electrophoresis, which confirmed the expected ratios. to determine the relative efficiency of the 1lox and 2lox specific real-time pcr reaction and to detect possible interference between the two alleles we conducted real-time pcr using 1: dilutions of the above mentioned fragment mixtures. as illustrated in figure 2c we observed a linear correlation between the crossing point and log concentration data for both reactions, with all data points close to the curve, indicating that the efficiency of both reactions was not affected by variable admixtures of the other allele. to further test the accuracy of the real-time pcr assay we conducted quantitive pcr, using incremental standards ranging from 9/ to 1/ and calculated allele ratios from the measured data. as summarized in figure 3a the 1lox/2lox allele ratios as determined by the probe based real-time pcr assay closely reflected allele ratios measured by capillary electrophoresis and the expected allele ratios. testing of probe based real-time pcr for analysis of cre-lox recombination in fabpl4× at -132-cre transgenic mice after establishing the accuracy of the method we measured conditional deletion of dnmt3a in intestinal epithelial cells of fabpl4× at -132-cre transgenic mice. for this we harvested intestinal epithelial cells from the proximal, middle and distal third of the small intestine of dnmt3a, fabpl4× at -132-cre mice and measured 1lox/2lox allele ratios using real-time pcr. as shown in figure 3d we detected a low deletion efficiency in the proximal small intestine and increasing deletion efficiency in the distal small intestine, with the 1lox/2lox allele ratio varying from to approximately respectively. importantly the data of the two cre+ mice were highly similar and the variation within the sample replicates was very low, confirming the reproducibility of the method. also, these results are in good agreement with published data on the same fabpl4× at -132-cre strain using northern blotting and immunohistochemistry, which further confirms the utility of the assay. discussion real-time pcr is clearly preferable to southern blotting when attempting to quantify conditional gene deletion: real-time pcr offers a higher sensitivity, requires significantly smaller dna samples and requires much less processing time. this is particularly useful when allele ratios have to be measured in small samples at several time points, such as in conditional deletion experiments involving hematopoetic stem cells. surprisingly, only one study formally evaluated this technical approach, however without testing the ability of the method to detect small changes in allele ratios. in principle either sybr green based protocols or probe based protocols can be used for real-time pcr. sybr green based assays are very popular because of the relatively low cost and the convenient implementation requiring primer design only. however, as illustrated by our example, it appears that sybr green based protocols for quantification of conditional gene deletion, are potentially complicated by the palindromic sequence of the loxp site. we show that pcr products containing this sequence, such as the 1lox specific pcr product, can generate double peaks during melting curve analysis, likely due to alternate product hybridization, which can complicate quality control of the reaction. in such cases it is uncertain whether the double peak reflects the presence of an additional nonspecific pcr product or not. we therefore suggest that it is generally preferable to use a probe based real-time pcr approach, which avoids such erroneous signals and offers improved specificity. the hydrolysis probe established in our protocol, that is used for analysis of both alleles, recognizes the loxp site itself and is therefore universally applicable to any assay measuring 1lox/2lox allele ratios. to adapt the assay to other conditional alleles it is therefore only necessary to place primer pairs in the unique genomic sequence flanking the loxp sites. our data support the notion that such probe based real-time pcr analysis allows reproducible and accurate measurement of 1lox/2lox allele ratios with small amounts of dna and is therefore a highly attractive alternative to conventional southern blotting.  our results suggest that probe based real-time pcr can accurately detect small differences in 1lox/2lox allele ratios with improved specificity. our protocol requires the use of one probe only for all reactions. this probe is directed against the loxp site itself and is therefore universally applicable to any assay analyzing cre-lox recombination efficiency, such that only the primer sequences have to be adapted. our assay therefore combines the convenience of sybr green based analysis with the specificity of probe based analysis and is applicable to all models of cre-lox mediated conditional gene deletion. "," conditional gene deletion using cre-lox recombination is frequently used in mouse genetics; however recombination is frequently incomplete, resulting in a mixture of cells containing the functional allele and the truncated allele. conventional analysis of 1lox/2lox allele ratios using southern blotting is time consuming, requires relatively large amounts of dna and has a low sensitivity. we therefore evaluated the utility of real-time pcr to measure 1lox/2lox allele ratios.  we show that sybr green based real-time pcr analysis of 1lox/2lox allele ratios can generate erroneous peaks in the melting curve that are possibly caused by alternate hybridization products promoted by the palindromic loxp sequence motif. since abnormal melting curves frequently contribute to dismissal of sybr green based data, we developed a convenient method with improved specificity that avoids such erroneous signals. our data show that probe based real-time pcr, using a universal probe directed against the loxp site, can accurately detect small differences in 1lox/2lox allele ratios. we also validated this method in fabpl4× at -132-cre transgenic mice, measuring 1lox/2lox allele ratios that are in agreement with published data. our real-time pcr protocol requires the use of one probe only for all reactions. also the universal probe established in our assay is generally applicable to any experiment analyzing cre-lox recombination efficiency, such that only primer sequences have to be adapted.  our data show that 1lox/2lox allele ratios are detected with high accuracy and high sensitivity with real-time pcr analysis using a probe directed against the loxp site. due to the generally applicable probe the assay is conveniently adapted to all models of cre-lox mediated gene deletion.

186," the roseobacter lineage, representing a group of alphaproteobacteria, is found in various marine habitats where it is present in high abundance, comprising up to 25% of the total bacterial community. overall, the diverse metabolic properties of the roseobacter clade and its ubiquitous occurrence in marine ecosystems suggest that members of this clade play an important role in global biogeochemical processes such as cycling of carbon or sulphur. members of the roseobacter clade participate in dmsp demethylation, the oxidation of carbon monoxide and degradation of aromatic compounds. typically, they use external organic substrates as carbon sources. of outstanding interest is the fact that they are able to generate energy from light and thus contribute significantly to phototrophic energy generation. all these important traits are linked to the core part of central carbon metabolism involved in the breakdown of nutrients and the supply of metabolites and energy for various cellular requirements. recent efforts in genome sequencing and annotation of roseobacter members have provided a first insight into the repertoire of underlying metabolic reactions available and have led to different suggestions for possible pathways that might be involved in important physiological functions. as an example, a mixotrophic co assimilation pathway has been proposed for r. denitrificans, in which co is fixed either via the combined action of pyruvate-orthophosphate dikinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase or via pyruvate carboxylase. for glucose catabolism, up to three alternative routes are encoded in the genome: glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the entner-doudoroff pathway. at this point, it seems highly relevant to study the contribution of these potential pathways to the metabolism of bacteria in the roseobacter clade to improve our understanding of their physiology. our current knowledge of the in vivo fluxes through intracellular pathways among the roseobacter lineage is still very limited. to address this issue, we applied metabolic flux analysis using 13c labelled isotopes to gain a first insight into the central catabolic pathways of dinoroseobacter shibae dfl and phaeobacter gallaeciensis dsm. these species represent two prominent members of the roseobacter clade. p. gallaeciensis has received strong interest due to its ability to produce the antibiotic tropodithietic acid. d. shibae was isolated as a novel species from marine dinoflagellates and lives in a symbiotic relationship with eukaryotic algae. metabolic flux analysis using 13c labelled isotopes has proven a key technology in the unravelling of metabolic pathways and has recently been used to study different microorganisms mainly linked to biotechnological production processes. no such study has yet been performed for members of the roseobacter clade.  cultivation profile the cultivation profile of d. shibae on defined medium with glucose as the sole carbon source is displayed in figure after an initial adaptation phase, cells grew exponentially with a constant specific growth rate of h- after hours of cultivation the carbon source was depleted and cells entered a stationary phase. the biomass yield was g cell dry mass per g glucose consumed, indicating efficient utilisation of the carbon source for growth. a similar growth profile was determined for p. gallaeciensis. pathways for glucose catabolism the carbon core metabolism of d. shibae and p. gallaeciensis consists of three potential routes for glucose catabolism. glucose can be alternatively catabolised via glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the entner-doudoroff pathway. the use of glucose by each individual pathway leads to a different labelling pattern in specific fragments of alanine and serine, which can be taken as a clear differentiation of flux. for d. shibae the corresponding fragment of serine did not show any enrichment of 13c but rather reflected the pattern resulting from the natural abundance of 13c only. any contribution of glycolysis to formation of this metabolite and its precursor 3-phosphoglycerate can therefore be excluded as this would lead to enrichment of 13c at the c position, yielding a higher fraction of m+ labelled molecules of ser. thus glycolytic flux obviously was not present. the two remaining possibilities, the ppp and the ed pathway, can be differentiated by the labelling pattern of alanine, which represents the pyruvate pool in the cell. the high enrichment of 13c label in the fragment of alanine indicates a large contribution of the ed pathway, since formation via the ppp would lead to non-labelled alanine. the fragment of alanine, comprising only the carbon atoms c and c of pyruvate, was not enriched in 13c, showing that pyruvate was labelled only at its c position. this perfectly matches the isotope pattern expected for the ed pathway, whereas glycolytic flux would have resulted in label enrichment at the c position, and further confirms the flux distribution. a tert-butyldimethylsilyl; fragmentation patterns are described elsewhere interestingly, p. gallaeciensis showed almost identical characteristics and obviously also uses mainly the ed pathway during growth on glucose. the quantification of relative flux revealed that the use of the ed pathway amounts to >99%, whereas glycolysis and ppp contribute only <1%. compared to other microorganisms such as e. coli, b. subtilis, b. megaterium or c. glutamicum grown on glucose, this is a rather unusual flux pattern. most organisms use glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway concomitantly but at varying ratios. exclusive utilisation of the ed pathway, as found here, has been previously observed in selected species of pseudomonas or arthrobacter where this behaviour was attributed to a lack of phosphofructokinase. among the two microorganisms studied, d. shibae does contain a gene encoding for this enzyme, whereas p. gallaeciensis does not. for both roseobacter species, in contrast to e. coli as positive control, phosphofructokinase activity could not be detected, clearly explaining the lack of glycolytic flux. while this matches with the genomic repertoire of p. gallaeciensis, we conclude at this stage that the phosphofructokinase in d. shibae is either not expressed, might have another function or even is a non-functional protein. the flux pattern for both organisms is supported by enzymatic assays showing high in vitro activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase, the two key enzymes in the entner-doudoroff pathway. athis study n.a. = not available in the organism pathways for pep synthesis - contribution of pyruvate-orthophosphate dikinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase based on the labelling data given above, the formation of pep from pyruvate by pyruvate-orthophosphate dikinase or via pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase would result in the presence of pep with13c enrichment at position c however, the fragments of phe and tyr, each corresponding to the carbon atoms c and c of pep, do not show significant enrichment of 13c. the same holds for the fragment, which corresponds to the entire carbon skeleton of phe and tyr and thus all precursors, that is, pep and e4p. flux quantification using equations and confirms that pep is solely synthesised by the reactions of lower glycolysis. this is an interesting finding with respect to the recently suggested mixotrophic co assimilation pathway for some members of the roseobacter clade, which also involves the potential contribution of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. despite the putative gene for this protein also being annotated for the species investigated here, we could clearly demonstrate that the formation of pep from pyr is not active in vivo under the conditions studied. pathways for oxaloacetate synthesis - contribution of co assimilation and oxidative tca cycle oxaloacetate as a central metabolite can be formed by two major pathways, that is, carboxylation involving pyruvate carboxylase or via pyruvate dehydrogenase and the energy-generating reactions of the tca cycle. the following data clearly suggest that both pathways are active simultaneously in the two roseobacters. for the experimental setup chosen and carbon transfer in the underlying metabolic reactions, the carboxylation of pyruvate is the only reaction that leads to 13c labelled oxaloacetate. the label can be present in carbon positions c or c whereby single- or double-labelled molecules can be formed, depending on the incorporation of 12co or 13co in contrast, the alternative route via the cyclic respiratory mode of the tca cycle yields exclusively non-labelled oxaloacetate. in all possible cases the labelled carbon atoms from either pyruvate or oxaloacetate are released in the decarboxylation steps of the tca cycle as 13co inspection of the labelling pattern of aspartate, corresponding to the oxaloacetate backbone, immediately shows that single- and double-labelled mass isotopomers are present in significant amounts for d. shibae and p. gallaeciensis, indicating in vivo activity of pyruvate carboxylase in both strains. however, the relative fractions of these 13c enriched mass isotopomers are relatively small, excluding sole contribution of this reaction to oxaloacetate synthesis. the dominant fraction consists of non-labelled molecules, obviously derived via the oxidative tca cycle. we thus conclude that the cyclic respiratory mode of the tca cycle is active in vivo in both strains. for d. shibae, which possesses a photosystem for energy generation, this mode might display an important strategy to derive energy under conditions where the photosystem is not active, for example, during the night or in deeper water regions.  being one of the first metabolic studies of members of the roseobacter clade using the 13c labelling experimental approach, a deeper insight into the activity of the important metabolic routes of d. shibae and p. gallaeciensis was achieved. interestingly, the use of intracellular pathways is highly similar in the studied species d. shibae and p. gallaeciensis. this stands in surprising contrast to the overall differences in phenotypic behaviour exhibited by these two strains, since d. shibae is an algal-associated microorganism whereas p. gallaeciensis is free-living in marine habitats. however, this may be a first indication of more general key properties among members of the roseobacter clade that explain their enormous success in the marine realm. "," in the present work the central carbon metabolism of dinoroseobacter shibae and phaeobacter gallaeciensis was studied at the level of metabolic fluxes. these two strains belong to the marine roseobacter clade, a dominant bacterial group in various marine habitats, and represent surface-associated, biofilm-forming growth and symbiotic growth with eukaryotic algae. based on information from recently sequenced genomes, a rich repertoire of pathways has been identified in the carbon core metabolism of these organisms, but little is known about the actual contribution of the various reactions in vivo.  using 13c labelling techniques in specifically designed experiments, it could be shown that glucose-grown cells of d. shibae catabolise the carbon source exclusively via the entner-doudoroff pathway, whereas alternative routes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are obviously utilised for anabolic purposes only. enzyme assays confirmed this flux pattern and link the lack of glycolytic flux to the absence of phosphofructokinase activity. the previously suggested formation of phosphoenolpyruvate from pyruvate during mixotrophic co assimilation was found to be inactive under the conditions studied. moreover, it could be shown that pyruvate carboxylase is involved in co assimilation and that the cyclic respiratory mode of the tca cycle is utilised. interestingly, the use of intracellular pathways was highly similar for p. gallaeciensis.  the present study reveals the first insight into pathway utilisation within the roseobacter group. fluxes through major intracellular pathways of the central carbon metabolism, which are closely linked to the various important traits found for the roseobacter clade, could be determined. the close similarity of fluxes between the two physiologically rather different species might provide the first indication of more general key properties among members of the roseobacter clade which may explain their enormous success in the marine realm.

187," in autoimmune diabetes the autoantibodies have always been important for clinical interest due to their potential role in screening, diagnosis, monitoring treatment of effectiveness and prognosis. the gad65abs are often considered to be an epiphenomenon resulting from the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells in t1d. previous studies suggest that they are involved in antigen processing and presentation and thus modulate the immune response. because of the high diagnostic sensitivity for autoimmune diabetes, the presence of gad65ab is currently used to identify subjects at high risk for the disease. gad65abs are detected in about 60% of new-onset cases of type diabetes, and high levels of these autoantibodies were also reported in diabetic patients with secondary complications, thus leading cause of blindness and renal failure. the exact etiology behind these complications is not completely clear. in our recent study; ros modified gad was found to be more immunogenic in t1d than its native form. gad65abs in t1d are predominantly directed at conformational epitopes located in the middle region of the molecule, whereas they also recognize linear epitopes and epitopes located in the middle, cooh- and nh2-terminuses. shifts in gad epitopes were detected in a subgroup of newly diagnosed children within the first months after disease onset. moreover, epitope spreading has gained credence as a major driver underlying autoimmunity. growing evidence suggests that ros plays an important role in the initiation and progression of diabetes and its associated complications. these increased levels of free radicals pose a direct toxic effect on gad and increase its immunogenicity. specificity of autoantibodies for epitopes on gad and their levels may be a better indicator of impending or actual destruction of islet β-cells and increasing complications associated with diabetes. in the view of the above mentioned studies we hypothesized some possible link between diabetic associated complications and presence of ros-gad65abs. to prove this, binding characteristics of serum autoantibodies from uncomplicated and complicated t1d patients were assessed with n-gad and ros-gad by direct binding and competitive elisa. the avidity of modified gad was also evaluated by precipitate titration curve in different diabetic groups.  ros modification of gad65 ros directed modification of gad studied previously by our group showed marked structural changes. khan et al., demonstrated that hyperchromicity and tryptophan specific fluorescence for modified gad was found to be significantly higher than native gad and the spectral analysis also showed blue shift of nm in modified gad over native gad far-uv-cd spectropolarimetry of ros-gad exhibited significant changes in secondary structural elements compared to its unmodified form decrease in α-helix and an increase of in β-sheet, random coil and turns was observed. detection of autoantibodies against n-gad and ros-gad65 in a pilot study serum samples from uncomplicated and complicated t1d patients were screened for autoantibodies against n-gad and ros-gad using unmodified and ros-modified gad as antigens. from figure we observed that sera from normal human subjects showed very low level of reactivity towards n-gad or ros-gad. conversely, serum autoantibodies of uncomplicated t1d patients showed significant binding with ros-gad as compared to n-gad. moreover, sera from diabetic nephropathic and diabetic retinopathic patients exhibited statistically higher significant differences in the binding pattern of serum autoantibodies with ros-gad as compared to n-gad. od was considered as a direct measure of the concentrations of autoantibodies in the serum samples. in all the study groups there were higher levels of reactivity of modified antigen as compared to its native form. nh samples showed 14% increased and uncomplicated serum samples exhibited % increased reactivity towards ros-gad as compared to n-gad whereas, nephropathic and retinopathic t1d complicated subjects showed an increase of % and 100% respectively, in the reactivity with modified antigen when compared with unmodified antigen. the binding specificities of serum autoantibodies from uncomplicated and complicated t1d patients were evaluated by competitive elisa using n-gad and ros-gad as inhibitors. significantly higher recognition of modified antigen was observed by the serum autoantibodies from nephropathic and retinopathic patients. n-gad exhibited no marked difference in recognition of serum igg from both complicated and uncomplicated subjects of t1d, table normal humans showed very less or negligible percent inhibition with either of the antigens. n-gad and m-gad

constant the amount of antigen bound to antibody was also evaluated by quantitative precipitin titration curve. igg of uncomplicated and complicated subjects was purified by affinity chromatography on protein a-agarose column. the purified iggs were found to elute in a single symmetrical peak. varying amounts of modified gad were mixed with μg of patient's igg and incubated for h at 37°c and overnight at 4°c. microsurface adsorption-spectral correction technique showed the interaction of igg with modified protein. langmuir equation was used to estimate aac of complicated and uncomplicated t1d samples for ros-gad and was computed to be × 10- m and × 10- m for t1d nephropathic and retinopathic patients respectively. uncomplicated t1d showed × 10- m aac. a maximum of μg and μg of ros-gad was bound to μg and μg of igg from t1d nephropathic and retinopathic subjects respectively. however uncomplicated t1d patients exhibited μg of igg bound with μg of ros-gad no appreciable differences were observed in the aacs calculated for n-gad in same above mentioned serum samples of complicated and uncomplicated t1d patients as shown in figure discussion the levels of ros increase many folds during t1d via formation of sorbitol by polyol pathways, regeneration of cofactors nadph and nad+ by nadh oxidase and glycation reactions. long term association of proteins with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and free radical intermediates results in protein modification both at the amino acid and protein levels. this statement is supported by our previous findings based on the structural characterization of native and ros-gad. significant recognition of ros-gad by serum autoantibodies of complicated t1d patients was estimated when compared with autoantibodies from uncomplicated t1d subjects. n-gad did not show any marked differences in recognitions of circulatory autoantibodies from complicated and uncomplicated t1d subjects. the affinity of gad65abs was found to be higher in subjects who had developed t1d with neuropathy or autoimmune polyendocrine disorders. in control normal humans, negligible binding was observed with either of the antigens. from the cohort, twenty serum samples each from complicated and uncomplicated t1d patients were selected and binding affinities of circulating autoantibodies with n-gad and ros-gad were ascertained by competitive elisa. twenty serum samples from normal humans were taken under the same experimental condition as controls. a characteristic difference was observed in the pattern of inhibition elisa assays obtained from complicated and uncomplicated t1d subjects in respect to ros-gad antigen. this indicates that the ros-modified gad is an effective inhibitor showing substantial higher titres of circulating autoantibodies in complicated t1d subjects as compared to uncomplicated t1d. moreover; amongst the complicated patients, retinopathic showed highest recognition for ros gad as compared to nephropathic and uncomplicated patients. further the study also elucidates that with increased duration of disease and poor glycemic control leads to increased oxidative stress and hence the complications. the oxidative stress was further ascertained by the levels of protein bound carbonyl content in patients which is a biomarker of protein oxidation. type diabetes retinopathic patients had highest carbonyl content followed by nephropathic and uncomplicated respectively. possible this heightened state of oxidative stress leads to extensive in vivo gad antigen modifications. thus gad of complicated t1d patients presents more number of epitopes that resemble in vitro ros modified gad and conceivably generates significant number of autoantibodies. gad65ab titers are higher and more prevalent in patients with other associated autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis. the strong dependence of conformation of protein for autoantibody recognition, blocking experiments and recombinant fab using monoclonal antibodies has been useful for determining conformational gad65ab epitopes. during immune-pathophysiology significant amounts of circulating immune complexes are formed and deposited in kidneys leading to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and other tissues causing severe injury. as we discussed in this study continuous long durations of increased levels of ros cause increase in antigenic determinants on gad so, the avidity of gad became more complex and gain increased strength of binding because of interdependency of epitopes. figure and clearly indicate better recognition of ros-gad than n-gad by igg isolated from retinopathic t1d subjects followed by nephropathic and uncomplicated t1d patient. the enhanced recognition of ros-gad by retinopathic t1d patient igg showed the possible participation of oxidative stress and long duration of disease as given in table that might have role in in vivo modification of gad inducing the molecule to express its cryptic epitopes.  in conclusion, significantly high levels of circulating ros-gad65abs were detected in complicated as compared to uncomplicated t1d patients. this risk of the disease may be exemplified due to acceleration in the formation of free radicals with gradual increase in duration of disease. this leads to conformational alterations in n-gad protein which could increase or expose cryptic epitopes. dynamic changes in the gad65abs binding pattern suggest subsequent epitopes spreading with disease progression. this could be one of the etiologies of increased gad65ab immunogenicity that implicated in t1d complications. measurement of these autoantibodies could be shown to be useful in assisting the prediction for the development of t1d progression/or complications. reduction in the levels of ros may lead to decrease in in vivo gad molecules modification thus, leads to delay in the progression of complications. hence antioxidants may play important role in the treatment. "," autoantibodies against glutamate decarboxylase- are thought to be a major immunological tool involved in pathogenic autoimmunity development in various diseases. gad65abs are a sensitive and specific marker for type diabetes. these autoantibodies can also be found in 6-10% of patients classified with type diabetes, as well as in 1-2% of the healthy population. the latter individuals are at low risk of developing t1d because the prevalence rate of gad65abs is only about %. it has, therefore, been suggested that the antibody binding to gad in these three different gad65ab-positive phenotypes differ with respect to epitope specificity. the specificity of reactive oxygen species modified gad is already well established in the t1d. however, its association in secondary complications of t1d has not yet been ascertained. hence this study focuses on identification of autoantibodies against ros-gad and quantitative assays in t1d associated complications.  from the cohort of samples, serum autoantibodies from t1d retinopathic and nephropathic patients showed high recognition of ros-gad as compared to native gad. uncomplicated t1d subjects also exhibited reactivity towards ros-gad however, this was found to be less as compared to the binding recorded from complicated subjects. these results were further proven by competitive elisa estimations. the apparent association constants indicate greater affinity of igg from retinopathic t1d patients followed by nephropathic and uncomplicated t1d patients for ros-gad compared to n-gad  increased oxidative stress and blood glucose levels with extended duration of disease in complicated t1d could be responsible for the gradual formation and/or exposing cryptic epitopes on gad that induce increased production of ros-gad65abs. hence regulation of ros-gad65abs could offer novel tools for analysing and possibly treating t1d complications.

188," the gilthead sea bream is a member of the sparidae family widely and successfully cultured in the mediterranean region. during the last decade more than scientific papers have focused on gilthead sea bream nutrition, immune response, physiology and genetics. this high valuable fish for aquaculture industry becomes, thereby, an interesting animal model, and the development of molecular and genomic tools for research is highly desirable. previous attempts have been made in this way and the assembly and annotation of more than expressed sequence tags allowed the development of specific gilthead sea bream microarrays that have been used in transcriptomic studies of crowding stress and parasite and nutritional challenges. microarray approaches have also been done in this species to assess transcriptome differences between two early larval stages, to underline the liver transcriptomic response after cortisol administration or to identify the key genes involved in the re-epithelialization process after scale removal. nevertheless, genomic tools still remain relatively scarce in gilthead sea bream and need to be further improved in comparison to other cultured fish, such as atlantic salmon, common carp, nile tilapia or turbot, for which large ests collections generated by sanger sequencing of cdna libraries are currently available. with the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies, the gathering of large amounts of sequence data for a given organism at affordable costs is more feasible, and high-throughput pyrosequencing has been used to explore the transcriptome of rainbow trout, atlantic cod and turbot. in the case of gilthead sea bream, two deep sequencing studies have been reported from whole larval tissues and skeletal muscle, yielding and assembled sequences, respectively. nevertheless, the assembly of high-throughput sequences from one unique tissue usually results in relatively short sequences. as the annotation success of a sequencing project is highly dependent on the size of the assembled sequences, approaches conducted to obtain longer sequences become desirable. at this respect, it has been proved in some animal models, including rainbow trout, that the use of two or more tissues for sequencing and assembly increases the number of annotated genes. on this basis, the primary goal of the present study was to generate a large amount of gilthead sea bream transcriptomic reads from metabolically and immunologically relevant tissues by means of the construction of five pyrosequencing libraries, combining them with sanger sequences from public repositories and our own published data. it comprised nine previously constructed suppression subtractive hybridization libraries that were obtained from a variety of tissues from animals exposed to confinement stress, parasite infection or a nutritional stress. having this into account, tissues selected for the improvement of the current knowledge on gilthead sea bream transcriptome by means of high-throughput sequencing were related to animal growth, nutrient digestion and immune response. because of the importance of the development of non-lethal diagnostic methods, blood was also considered for sequencing. the second goal of this work was to build a reliable assembly database, with a high confidence of functional annotation by means of similarity searches, gene ontology terms and detailed insights on pathway analysis for its use as a practical tool by the scientific community. this will assist gene discovery and studies on functional genomics, as well as future genome projects of this important fish species.  five normalized cdna libraries from skeletal muscle, intestine, blood and head kidney were constructed and sequenced in separate half-runs using 454-titanium flx technology. table  summarizes the results for each one of the five normalized libraries. collectively, more than, high-quality reads averaging nt each were produced, representing gb of expressed sequence information. for each library, an independent assembly was performed with the newbler software, and the number of assembled contigs ranged within libraries from to with an average length of 831– nt. at this stage and regardless of the tissue library, the number of singletons that failed to assemble remained relatively high. as a result of this, the 67-77% of the information derived from each individual library was supported only by short singleton reads, which is particularly critical given that most assembly software programs include default steps that discard them to give more reliable results, with the unadvised loss of potentially valuable data. this is a complex issue and to solve it, we considered a unique global assembly with the already available mrna sequences and est collections in combination with all the unassembled high-quality reads derived from the five libraries. sequence characteristics of the five normalized libraries derived from skeletal muscle, intestine, blood and head kidney. as a result of the above integrative approach, the average number of reads composing each contig increased from - in the individual tissue assemblies to in the global assembly. this large improvement increased the reliability of the transcriptomic database, yielding assembled contigs with an average length of nt that cover the % of the consensus megabases. this finding agrees with the observation that the total number of assembled contigs increased from to when five skeletal muscle libraries of gilthead sea bream were globally and not individually assembled. both in that and the present study, the number of reads used for the assembly is of the same order of magnitude, but in our case they are derived from four different tissues and after combination with sanger reads from public repositories the final number of contigs was more than the double of that reported in. of a total number of sequences, the % were annotated using nucleotide and protein reference databases. this annotation ratio is quite higher than those reported in high-throughput sequencing studies conducted in other fish species of interest in aquaculture, such as turbot, blunt snout bream or silver carp. this annotation improvement can be explained by the high length of the contigs derived from the present study, which is also inferred when comparisons are made with previous studies in the same species, rendering a contig size of nt and nt in length for libraries of skeletal muscle and whole larvae, respectively. the contig depth was increased in parallel and the best blastx hits for the potentially transcribed proteins yielded different swissprot accessions. this finding suggests that our nucleotide database would contain more than the 75% of the protein coding transcripts of gilthead sea bream, assuming an average size of - genes in a fish with a non-recently duplicated genome. with independence of a high coverage of protein-coding transcripts, more than assemblies still remain without annotation. this relatively high number of unknown sequences could correspond to more divergently evolved genes through vertebrate evolution, though we cannot exclude that some of these sequences may result from assembly artifacts. alternatively, some of these sequences might correspond to long non-coding rnas, which are now emerging as an important class of regulatory transcripts with an extent that increases much more with organism complexity. otherwise, high-throughput sequencing is prone to sequencing errors at homopolymer regions, even when assembled at high coverage, which often give rise to a range of artificial sequences. to overcome this issue, an in silico correction step was introduced in the pipeline procedure, which allowed to obtain continuous open reading frames for annotated sequences avoiding frameshifting by edition of single nucleotides at homopolymer regions. with this newly developed tool, up to 34% of annotated sequences were detected to carry one or more frameshifts. among them, were satisfactorily corrected with the pipeline and only needed a manual curation. quality and reliability of the assembled gilthead sea bream database was assessed by blastx comparison of randomly chosen transcripts of the stickleback transcriptome. of note, the 71% of these stickleback transcripts were originally annotated by the stickleback consortium, and for 94% of them a positive result with the same annotation was found using our database as a transcriptome reference. besides, reliable annotations were found for sequences out of that were not previously annotated in the stickleback transcriptome. again this successful result can be explained by the high average length of the assembled gilthead sea bream sequences, obtained by de novo global assembly of sanger sequences and high-throughput sequences of four metabolically and immunologically relevant tissues. blast2go analysis of the different annotations reveals that the most abundant go terms related to biological processes were transport, protein modification process, response to stress, regulation of biological quality and negative regulation of cellular process. other highly represented terms are immune system process, haemopoiesis and coagulation, which is not surprising given that out of five libraries were derived from blood and head kidney. regarding skeletal muscle, tissue-specific biological processes like muscle structure development, muscle cell differentiation or muscle contraction were also highly represented in the annotated gilthead sea bream transcriptome. likewise, the intestine participates in nutrient digestion and absorption with also an important role in xenobiotic metabolism, and accordingly genes related to the molecular functions hydrolase activity and oxidoreductase activity were highly abundant in our database. go terms define gene sets, but the relevance of a given metabolic process or biological pathway in a dataset is determined not only by the number of identified genes, but also by their relative abundance ratio considering the total number of genes involved in each pathway. for this reason, precise mapping of metabolic pathways becomes necessary, and the usefulness of pathway analysis software is largely increasing. to date, the only fish metabolic network available, the public online tool metafishnet, is still far from completion, so pathway analysis of the gilthead sea bream annotated sequences was performed by means of the ingenuity pathway analysis software. conversion of the annotated gilthead sea bream sequences to ipa elements assumed that the functional classification of genes did not vary too much widely between teleostean fish and model species. in this scenario, from the initial list of annotated gilthead sea bream descriptions, the ipa software identified uniprot codes with model species equivalences, and of them were eligible for function/pathway analysis. these sequences were represented in ipa canonical pathways mapped from a total of which reinforces the idea that the present gilthead sea bream transcriptome is of high coverage and, thereby, very close to completion of the protein-coding transcriptome. the most representative high-level functional categories are listed in table  with precise information of statistic values and number of represented molecules. the top five canonical pathways were regulation of eif- and p70s6k signaling, purine metabolism, eif signaling, protein ubiquitination pathway, and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. as a corollary, the complete list of canonical pathways with the ratio of gilthead sea bream genes present in each one is provided as additional file and the graphical representation of representative canonical pathways of processes of interest are presented in additional file in order to construct a reliable database of protein-coding transcripts with a minimum of frameshift errors or redundancies, a strict filtering was applied to the annotated sequences after the in silico homopolymer correction step. sequences with a significant hit against swissprot were selected, and then sequences encoding for a same annotation regardless of the species were clustered. filtering selected for each annotation non-overlaping sequences and putative complete open reading frames, that made a total of sequences that were uploaded in our nucleotide database. this online resource is intended to become a dynamic and useful tool for scientific community. with this interface, data can be queried using different strategies, such as several blast options or direct word search for annotation or go terms. search results provide additional information for each sequence, like its length, depth or the related swissprot accession for the assigned annotation, among others.  a gilthead sea bream transcriptome database has been constructed by de novo assembly of five normalized libraries from metabolically and immunologically relevant tissues combined with public sequences that included nine ssh libraries. this approach yielded different sequences, and for a reliable annotation was found, resulting in different gene descriptions that comprised a vast array of functional categories and biological pathways. this constitutes the largest and most complete transcriptome reported to date for gilthead sea bream, having a size and depth equivalent to those reported in the ensembl genome database for atlantic cod and other cultured fish species. the information of annotated contigs has been semi-automatically corrected and filtered for redundancies, and is stored in a web database that has been provided with blast and other search options for the scientific community. this represents a valuable tool to assist fish phenotyping and the concomitant development of molecular biomarker panels of prognostic and diagnostic value to cope with developmental-, nutritional-, environmental- and disease-related stressors. "," the gilthead sea bream is the main fish species cultured in the mediterranean area and constitutes an interesting model of research. nevertheless, transcriptomic and genomic data are still scarce for this highly valuable species. a transcriptome database was constructed by de novo assembly of gilthead sea bream sequences derived from public repositories of mrna and collections of expressed sequence tags together with new high-quality reads from five cdna normalized libraries of skeletal muscle, intestine, head kidney and blood.  sequencing of the new normalized libraries produced, high-quality reads and the de novo global assembly yielded unique sequences with an average length of nt. blast analysis directed to protein and nucleotide databases annotated sequences encoding for gene descriptions, that were curated for redundancies and frameshifting at the homopolymer regions of open reading frames, and hosted at http://www.nutrigroup-iats.org/seabreamdb. among the annotated gene descriptions, were mapped in the ingenuity pathway analysis database, and were eligible for functional analysis with a representation in out of ipa canonical pathways. the high representation of randomly selected stickleback transcripts by blast search in the nucleotide gilthead sea bream database evidenced its high coverage of protein-coding transcripts.  the newly assembled gilthead sea bream transcriptome represents a progress in genomic resources for this species, as it probably contains more than 75% of actively transcribed genes, constituting a valuable tool to assist studies on functional genomics and future genome projects. sparus auratanext-generation sequencingde novo assemblytranscriptomedatabase ",9b963b1a-d151-4fee-bd91-90a59e1a6ab3,pubmed
189," genome sequencing projects are generating massive amounts of sequence data, and the functional annotation of these sequences became one of the most challenging tasks, especially for the many proteins whose functions remain unknown. traditional computational methods have utilized sequence features and machine learning algorithms to predict functions. in recent years, high-throughput technologies, such as yeast-two hybrid, have provided large scale protein-protein interaction data, making it possible to develop new function prediction methods based on protein-protein interaction networks. existing protein function prediction methods based on ppi can be categorized into two classes: direct methods based only on the protein interactions and module-assisted methods. direct methods directly infer protein functions from interactions in the ppi networks while module-assisted methods first try to find functional modules in the ppi networks and then assign protein functions based on the module functions. direct methods are based on the assumption that interacting proteins probably have identical or similar functions. this assumption is supported by previous studies which show that 70%-80% of proteins share at least one identical function with their interacting partners. schwikowski et al used a neighbor counting method to predict protein functions. they took up to three most frequent functions of interacting partners as indicators of the function of each protein, which turned out to cover over 70% of the known functions. hisigaki et al tried to predict protein functions by computing the chi-square statistics as an indicator of functions that were statistically significantly frequent among neighboring proteins. chua et al investigated the relationships between functional similarity and network distance. they utilized functional information from proteins within or neighborhoods of a protein by giving different weights to different network distances. vazquez et al assigned functions to proteins via an iterative algorithm by maximizing the number of edges that connect proteins with the same function. other graph-based methods include those of karaoz et al and nabieva et al. instead of predicting individual protein functions, module-assisted methods first identify functional modules in ppi networks and then assign functions to the proteins according to functions of the module members. these methods are based on previous observations that a group of cellular components and their interactions usually can be attributed to a specific function. the approaches of different module-assisted methods vary mainly on the methods for identifying functional modules, which divide the methods into those based on network topology only and those which integrate multiple data sources. network topology based methods include mcode, a module-assisted method based on clustering coefficients, the clustering method of rives et al and the hierarchical clustering method of spirin et al. ge et al showed that proteins having similar functions tend to have similar expression patterns, which can be used to predict protein functions. ideker et al developed a framework to identify active sub-networks by detecting significant changes in expression over a particular set of conditions. hanisch et al applied a co-clustering methodology that combined similarities in gene expression patterns and network topologies. hierarchical clustering was then used to define functional modules. although several existing methods have combined multiple information resources, such as gene expression information, gene regulatory networks and ppi networks, none of them have yet integrated protein domain information and ppi networks to predict protein functions. this paper presents a novel protein function prediction method that uses protein domain composition and ppi networks. this paper first demonstrates that proteins having similar functions are often in similar domain contexts in ppi networks and then develops the protein function prediction method based on this observation. the method gives satisfactory results compared to several existing methods. methods yeast ppi network data was obtained from dip database. proteins and protein-protein interactions were included in the network. the yeast ppi network was chosen because it is comparatively more complete with fewer missing interactions. nearly 70% of the orfs of yeast are covered by the yeast ppi network, which is the highest coverage ratio among ppi networks of all organisms. besides, the yeast ppi network is the most frequently used in previous protein function prediction studies, which allows accuracy comparison to other methods. the domain annotation information was retrieved from the pfam database. the hmmer software package was used to annotate domains in the yeast orfs. domains of domain types were obtained from proteins. the protein function annotation information was provided by the gene ontology database. domains are basic functional units in proteins. cellular functions are accomplished by the cooperation of many domains in proteins. therefore, the ppi network was decomposed into the domain level to investigate protein functions in terms of domain. figure shows a simplified model. protein a has neighbors in the ppi network, which all-together contain different domains, while protein b has neighbors with the same domains. domain shuffling or recombination during evolution may have changed the domain distribution among proteins. one possible situation is that domain is in the same protein with domain in one organism, while in another organism, it is combined with domain. despite the different domain distribution, similar domain compositions of neighbors of protein a and b in the ppi network may indicate both functional similarity and evolutionary relationship. thus proteins with similar domain contexts in the ppi network may share similar functions. the domain context similarity is defined as: where m is the number of domain types in the ppi network. given proteins a and b, sa and sb are the sets of domains included in a's neighbors and in b's neighbors. the number of domain types in sa is a, while the number of domain types in sb is b. the intersection of sa and sb is s, containing s types of domains. c denotes combinatorial numbers. the larger f indicates a greater probability that a and b share similar functions. for each go term, there is a positive data set composed of present proteins, and a negative data set including absent ones. for example, go: is used to describe yeast proteins, so these proteins were treated as positive samples. since some go terms contains only a few proteins and other go terms are too general, only go terms containing 10- proteins were considered. given a protein p with unknown function, in order to examine its function with regard to each particular go term, the domain context similarities, f, between p and each protein in both the positive and negative data sets were calculated. the function annotation of the protein with the highest f value was then assigned to p. the 7-fold cross validation, which has been widely implemented in previous researches, was used to evaluate the performance of our prediction. for every go term, both the positive and negative data sets were divided into seven equal parts randomly. every time six positive parts and six negative parts were used as the training data set while the remaining parts was used as the test data set. this procedure was repeated times to ensure that every part was used once as the test data set for one go term. then the whole procedure was repeated for every go term. the final accuracy was the average of the evaluations. four frequently used measurement indices, accuracy, precision, recall and mathew correlation coefficient, were used to evaluate the prediction performance. the mathew correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the prediction performance when the numbers of proteins in the positive and negative data sets differed significantly. mcc ranges from - to a larger mcc indicating better prediction performance. for data with positive predictions, the real positives are defined as true positives, while others are defined as false positives. for data with negative predictions, the real positives are defined as false negatives, while the others are defined as true negatives. then, the measurement indices are defined as:  the relationships between protein function similarity and domain context similarity in the ppi network were investigated based on the measurement indices. first, pairs of proteins were randomly extracted from one go term with the domain context similarity, f, then calculated for each pair. secondly, another random protein pairs were generated using pair of proteins from different go terms. their f values are also calculated. the two sets of similarities were then compared to demonstrate the positive significant relationship between functional similarity and domain context similarity. the results showed that set a has a mean similarity, f, of compared to for set b. kolmogorov-smirnov test showed that set a is significantly higher than set b with a p-value less than 10- the distributions of the similarity for sets a and b are shown in figures and there are many values between and in set a, while most values in set b are near hence, the domain context similarity can be a useful index to predict protein function similarity. the method was then used to predict protein functions in yeast. go terms were divided into groups according to the number of proteins in each go term. go terms containing less than proteins were excluded due to the lack of a satisfactory number of proteins for accurate predictions. go terms including more than proteins were also eliminated because the function annotations in these go terms are usually too general. the results are shown in table the prediction accuracies are between 63%-67%. the results show that the method has satisfactory robustness for various numbers of proteins within one go term. as number of proteins increases from 10- to 100- the accuracy only decreases slightly, by about 4%. the phenomenon that accuracies decrease as number of proteins in the go term increases can be attributed to the fact that functional annotations in larger go terms are not as specific as in smaller go terms. fuzzy, general annotation information may affect the prediction performance. further investigation is required to explain this observation. besides, the recall is higher than the precision, demonstrating that false positive predictions are more common than false negative predictions. this method was then compared with existing methods based on the roc curves. the three previously developed methods included in comparison are mrf, neighbor counting and chi-square method. the random prediction performance was also presented. the roc curves shown in figure indicate that the current method outperforms the other methods. discussion a new prediction method for protein function based on protein-protein interaction and domain context was presented in this research. domain context similarity in the protein-protein interaction network was defined and used as in index for prediction. the underling principle of this method was that proteins tend to interact with each other via domain-domain interaction. so the high quality domain-domain interaction information may improve the prediction accuracy. riley at al developed domain pair exclusion analysis to infer high-confidence domain interaction from protein interactions. besides, dima try to identify known and predicted domain interactions which may be helpful if this information was utilized in our method. this research also suggests several future directions of research. first, domain context similarity measurements or prediction systems can be improved to reduce false positive predictions and boost accuracy. for example, the cutoff value for domain context similarity can be introduced to improve the accuracy and to deal with multiple function problems. since the underlying rationale of this method is the domain-domain interaction, high-quality domain interactions can definitely contribute to the accuracy. as mentioned above, the newly developed domain interaction inferring method can be used in our future algorithm improvement. second, as shown by chua et al, functional similarities exist between neighbor proteins with distances equal to or larger than which may be useful information to be included in function prediction. third, other data resources, such as gene expression profiles and gene regulatory networks, could be combined with domain context information to prediction functions. different weight can be assigned to different types of information. machine learning methods, such as svm, can also be utilized to take the information listed above as input features. finally, since protein domains are conserved and can be easily detected in various organisms, this method should be promising in comparing protein functions across species.  the availability of large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to predict protein functions based on protein-protein interaction networks. several existing methods combine multiple information resources to predict protein functions. we present a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein domain composition information and ppi networks. performance evaluations show that this method outperforms existing methods. the results are used to analyze the relationships between domain context similarity and protein function similarity, while this research may have potential future research directions. competing interests the authors declare

190," the worldwide cosmetics market reached billion us dollars in which was a % increase compared to. there are many compounds used as cosmetic ingredients, such as phycobiliprotein from natural sources, which is used as a colorant, polysaccharides used as emulsifiers, and a polymer used for mascara. much research has been conducted to develop appropriate materials for cosmetic ingredients. in particular, these studies focused not only on beauty care, but also on functional aspects. many trials are underway that aim to find ingredients for functional cosmetics, which would have whitening, anti-oxidant or anti-ageing effects. any cosmetic ingredient has to satisfy several requirements, such as thermal stability, high dermal absorption rate, and perfume. gallic acid is a phenolic acid and a phytochemical derived from herbs. it is found in gallnuts, sumac, witch hazel, tea leaves, oak bark, and other plants, and has anti-fungal, anti-viral, and antioxidant properties, which are useful for a cosmetic ingredient. with the development of biotechnology, peptides can be now produced on a large scale massively produced, and are used in cosmetic industry as ingredients. peptides used in topical anti-ageing products are classified into categories: carrier peptides, signaling peptides, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter inhibitors. carrier peptides can deliver other components of cosmetic preparations when these are applied topically. in this study, we explored the possibility of synthesis of a phytochemical and a peptide for use as a cosmetic ingredient. we assessed aspects of the novel compound: its safety, stability, functionality as a cosmetic ingredient. to evaluate the safety of galloyl-rgd to the skin, we measured the viability of hacat keratinocytes. to assess its stability, we measured its thermal stability. we also analysed its free radical–scavenging effect, and its ability to inhibit l-dopa formation and l-dopa oxidation.  galloyl-rgd purification using a c preparative column we developed a method for synthetic peptide purification by high performance liquid chromatography on an analytical c column in a gradient using % trifluoroacetic acid in water and % trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as solvents. although the purity of synthetic galloyl-rgd was about 70%, it increased up to 95% after hplc purification. confirmation of galloyl-rgd structure by maldi-tof galloyl-rgd was synthesized to combine rgd as a peptide to support physiological activity and gallic acid as a phytochemical to scavenge free radicals. a maldi-tof mass spectrometry assay was conducted to confirm the molecular weight and chemical structure of galloyl-rgd. as shown in figure  the galloyl-rgd produced met the quality standards required for a cosmetic material. galloyl-rgd is stable for 60 days at alternating temperatures storage conditions of cosmetics may change from low temperature to room temperature, i.e. they may be subjected to temperature changes of ca. 20°c. for this reason, thermal stability is an important characteristic of cosmetic materials. both gallic acid and galloyl-rgd were stable at alternating temperatures, but their stabilities were different depending on the storage period. the amounts remaining after storage for 20 days, 40 days, or 60 days were 81 ± 4%, 74 ± 6%, and 66 ± 23%, respectively, for gallic acid, and 94 ± 4%, 92 ± 8%, and 87 ± 29% for galloyl-rgd. gallic acid was relatively unstable, and was degraded to 66 ± 2% on the end of the experiment, whereas galloyl-rgd was degraded by only 87 ± 2%. galloyl-rgd is safe to hacat keratinocytes human body is surrounded by keratinocytes, which protect it from various factors and prevent damage from chemicals, microbes and dehydration. thus, development of new cosmetics should include measurements of their effects on keratinocytes.after treatment for 48 h, the viability of hacat keratinocytes was %, %, %, %, and 80% in the presence of 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 500 ppm, and 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd, respectively. these results indicate that galloyl-rgd is safe to hacat keratinocytes at concentrations of up to 100 ppm. galloyl-rgd scavenges free radicals produced by dpph and reactive oxygen species by uv irradiation free radicals have both useful and harmful effects on organisms; they confer protection to host against harmful fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but may also induce host cell damage. in the case of cosmetics, damage to epithelial cells in the skin is more important than other effects because most cosmetics are directly applied to the skin. the levels of free radicals are controlled by the balance of their production and elimination in the cells. a reduction in elimination relative to production could destroy epithelial cells of the skin.we found that the free radical –scavenging effect of galloyl-rgd after 48 h incubation was % at 10 ppm, and the quantities of free radicals decreased with increasing galloyl-rgd concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. galloyl-rgd scavenged effectively free radical not only in the test tube but also efficiently eliminated ros which was generated by 60 min ultraviolet irradiation in hacat cells. the ros scavenging effect of galloyl-rgd both in 50 ppm and 100 ppm galloyl-rgd treatment groups was higher than in 20 ppm nac treatment. galloyl-rgd efficiently inhibits l-dopa formation and l-dopa oxidation tyrosinase converts tyrosine to -dihydroxyphenylalanine, and if l-dopa is oxidized it is converted into dopaquinone, which is a precursor of melanin biosynthesis. melanin is a pigment related to skin darkening. higher amounts of the above compounds result in larger black spots on the skin. the effect on melanin synthesis is one of the important parameters that need to be tested during development of new cosmetics.we measured l-dopa formation inhibition and suppression of l-dopa oxidation after incubation with galloyl-rgd for 48 h. the l-dopa formation inhibition rate was %, %, and % in the presence of 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd, respectively. as shown in figure 6b, galloyl-rgd suppressed l-dopa oxidation to %, %, and % at 50 ppm, 100 ppm or 1000 ppm concentrations, respectively, compared to the control group. discussion galloyl-rgd is a synthetic conjugate of gallic acid and a peptide, synthesized for intended use as a new cosmetic ingredient, purified using hplc and validated by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. thermal stability of galloyl-rgd was tested at alternating temperatures. it was relatively safe to hacat keratinocytes, as their viability after 48 h incubation was % in the presence of 500 ppm galloyl-rgd. in the 50 ppm galloyl-rgd–treated group, % of free radical was removed, ros was scavenged more effectively more than by 20 ppm nac-treated group in hacat cells, and treatment with 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd suppressed not only activation-dopa formation but also l-dopa oxidation. to pursue the beauty is a basic human instinct, and as people were looking for ways to make themselves more beautiful the cosmetic industry has significantly grown. recently, the number of trials aimed at finding more effective ingredients for cosmetics has increased, especially search for the functional ingredients effective for whitening, smoothing the creases, scavenging free radicals, or anti-ageing. for a long time, natural products have been used for multiple purposes such as remedies, cosmetics, culinary materials, or additives; these various functions are due to multiple phytochemicals in the natural products. a number of recent studies have found that the functions of natural products depend on constituent phytochemicals. gallic acid is a phytochemical, which has been isolated from several plants such as emblica officinalis gaertn, phaleria macrocarpa boerl, quercus robur, and castanea sativa l. and has anti-fungal, anti-viral, antioxidant properties. however, gallic acid is thermally unstable, which makes its use as cosmetic ingredient difficult. to overcome this weakness, we considered gallic acid conjugation with a peptide. recently, many peptides have been introduced, as they not only have important functions in specific fields, but are also able to improve something more effective. for example, peptides have been used in cosmetic industry to increase skin permeability and duration.  we conclude that galloyl-rgd is a promising candidate for a cosmetic ingredient. "," the cosmetics market has rapidly increased over the last years. for example, in it reached billion us dollars, which was a % increase compared to there have been many recent trials aimed at finding the functional ingredients for new cosmetics. gallic acid is a phytochemical derived from various herbs, and has anti-fungal, anti-viral, and antioxidant properties. although phytochemicals are useful as cosmetic ingredients, they have a number of drawbacks, such as thermal stability, residence time in the skin, and permeability through the dermal layer. to overcome these problems, we considered conjugation of gallic acid with a peptide.  we synthesized galloyl-rgd, which represents a conjugate of gallic acid and the peptide rgd, purified it by hplc and characterized by maldi-tof with the aim of using it as a new cosmetic ingredient. thermal stability of galloyl-rgd was tested at alternating temperatures on days and galloyl-rgd was relatively safe to hacat keratinocytes, as their viability after 48 h incubation with 500 ppm galloyl-rgd was %. in the group treated with 50 ppm galloyl-rgd, % of free radicals were removed, whereas 1000 ppm galloyl-rgd suppressed not only l-dopa formation but also l-dopa oxidation.  galloyl-rgd is a promising candidate for a cosmetic ingredient.

191," enteropathogenic escherichia coli are an important cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, particularly in brazil. epec strains produce a characteristic intestinal histopathology called the attaching-and-effacing lesion, which is characterized by microvilli effacement and intimate bacterial adherence to the epithelial membrane. the genes responsible for a/e lesion phenotype are encoded on -kb chromosomal pathogenicity island known as the locus of enterocyte effacement. the lee island comprises approximately genes and encodes the components of a type iii secretion system, various effector molecules, and the intimin adhesin which is encoded by the eae gene. epec strains are classified into typical and atypical based on the presence of the large virulence epec adherence factor plasmid. the eaf plasmid encodes a type iv fimbria known as the bundle-forming pilus that mediate localized adherence to epithelial cells. a 14-gene operon is necessary for bfp production, with bfpa encoding the major structural subunit. a second operon on the eaf plasmid is the plasmid-encoded regulator, consisting of three genes, which activates genes within the lee and the bfp operon. additional criteria for classifying isolates as epec include the detection of specific serogroups. classic epec o serogroups include o o o o o o o o o and o by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis of allelic differences among housekeeping genes, typical epec strains have been subtyped into two major lineages, previously designated epec and epec. the epec includes widespread serotypes such as o55:h and o119:h whereas epec consists of serotypes with more limited occurrence such as o111:h and o114:h based on a whole-genome phylogeny and analysis of type iii secretion system effectors, typical epec strains have been demonstrated to cluster in three main lineages, designated epec epec and epec. according to the phylogenomic analyses by hazen et al. the term atypical epec refers to a group of phylogenetically diverse isolates than often are more similar to e. coli of other pathovars than epec. however, although the term atypical epec may be considered misleading, atypical strains are identified by the presence of eae and the absence of the eaf probe sequence as well as the shiga toxin-encoded genes. a 1-kb cryptic region of eaf plasmid has been widely used as a genetic probe for epec detection. however, some epec strains, as demonstrated by bfp production, may in fact harbor an eaf plasmid lacking the eaf probe sequence, which makes the differentiation between typical and atypical complex. other epec strains harbor an eaf plasmid that shares a conserved backbone, and is in many ways similar to pmar plasmid of epec strain e2348/ and pb plasmid of epec strain b but with inactivating deletions in the bfp and per operons that are required for la. such strains are phenotypically “atypical”, since they do not produce a typical la pattern on epithelial cells, even though they carry probe-detectable eaf plasmids. in this study, we report the genetic analysis of the eaf plasmid-encoded genes in a collection of epec clinical isolates.  in this study, we analyzed a collection of epec clinical isolates, including strains of the classic and nonclassic epec serotypes, which were previously classified as typical or atypical by eaf probe reactivity. initially, all strains were screened for the eaf probe sequence by using a pcr with primers located nucleotides upstream and nucleotides downstream the eaf sequence of pmar. as shown in tables  and the majority of typical strains yielded the expected 1260-bp amplicon. interestingly no pcr product was obtained from a subset of typical strains, of which belonged to o serogroup. to verify this, a new primer located nucleotides upstream perb was designed to include the region between perbc and eaf sequence. all typical strains showed a pcr product approximately -kb smaller than the expected. dna sequencing revealed the presence of a pb deletion not previously reported, in the region between 1093-bp downstream perc and 616-bp of the eaf fragment. as expected all the atypical strains were pcr-negative.table results of pcr and hybridization for eaf-encoded genes among typical epec strains + + + + nm nonmotile;

192," it is well known that cytotoxic factors, such as lipopolysaccharides, derange nitrogen metabolism in hepatocytes and nitric oxide is involved among the other factors regulating this metabolic pathway. no is a free radical that is involved in many cellular events. in the biological systems no has an halflife long lasting few seconds. it is an oxidation intermediate, therefore is both an oxidant and a reducing agent of metabolic products. its biosynthesis is mainly performed by converting l-arginine to l-citrulline. l-arginine analogues, such as ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, act as false substrates and are selective inhibitors of no synthesis. no synthase is either a constitutive or inducible enzyme. the endothelial isoform and the neuronal isoform are constitutive. the inducible form of the enzyme, has the main property to be not regulated by intracellular calcium concentration and ca2+-calmodulin complex, unlike the constitutive form. it is known that inos is expressed by many cell types including macrophages, smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes. hepatocytes have been shown to express large levels of no following exposure to endotoxins, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and/or cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-. no may posses both cytoprotective and cytotoxic properties, depending on the amount and the isoform of nos by which it is produced. no generally mediates beneficial responses, but becomes deleterious when coexistence with enhanced superoxide formation leads to the synthesis of peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant and nitrating agent. according to this hypothesis, authors studied the effect of bradykinin, a proinflammatory mediator kinin, on cell viability and on urea production in cultures of rat hepatocytes. kinins exert numerous physiological and pathological actions; they partecipate in vascular and cellular events that accompany the inflammatory processes. in pathological states, kinins are thought to be implicated in inflammatory diseases and in haemorrhagic and endotoxic shock. to demonstrate the decrease of cell viability and urea production by bradykinin, the authors studied its effects on no production. the measurements of no release from hepatocytes were investigated by using a no-specific fluorescence indicator, diaminofluorescein diacetate.  effect of bradykinin treatment on no production the amounts of released no were measured using daf-2da, that specifically reacts with the oxidized form of no, producing the fluorescent triazolofluorescein. no determination was performed after hours of incubation in the presence of bradykinin. as shown in figure the treatment with mm bradykinin did not produce no increase compared to control, but mm bradykinin increased significantly the no release. in contrast no appreciable no release was observed during the same period in hepatocytes cultured with mm bradykinin and mm l-name. effect of bradykinin treatment on urea production to evaluate urea synthesis after bradykinin treatment, the hepatocytes were treated with mm nh4cl for h. figure shows that only the treatment with mm bradykinin significantly decreased urea production and that the treatment with mm bradykinin and mm l-name did not produce a significant urea level decrease in comparison to control. effect of bradykinin treatment on cell viability to determine the effects of bradykinin on cell viability, the hepatocytes were exposed to bradykinin for an incubation time of hours. in one experimental series, the cell viability was determined by mtt test after hours of incubation. in a second one, culture medium containing bradykinin was removed and replaced with the same fresh medium at hours after the addition of bradykinin, and then cell viability was measured hours after the end of bradykinin treatment. the mtt test after hours of incubation does not indicate any significant viability difference in treated hepatocyte cultures in comparison to control. by mtt test after h, a significant lowering of viability is observed in bradykinin mm treated hepatocytes in comparison to control. the decrease was significantly reduced by the simultaneous treatment with l-name mm even if always significantly lower than in control. cell viability was validated by trypan blue exclusion test. discussion the role of no as mediator of hepatic injury after endotoxic shock remains controversial. increased no production in response to cytokines has been demonstrated in cultured hepatocytes. laskin et al. demonstrated that the induction of acute endotoxemia, caused an increase in no production in the liver. this was associated with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger m-rna in hepatocytes. also our data showed an increase of no production after hours treatment of culture with mm bradykinin in an arginine supplemented medium, as substrate for the synthesis of no. the simultaneous treatment with l-name, a known inhibitor of nos, blocked the increase of no production. in this work we analyzed the urea synthesis after bradykinin treatment. urea synthesis was decreased after hours treatment with bradykinin mm and the simultaneous treatment with l-name leaves urea biosynthesis unaltered. these data can be attributed to the control role of arginine in both urea and no biosynthesis. when no is synthesized from arginine, by the nos reaction, cytrulline, an intermediate of urea cycle, is produced. thus, the urea cycle is bypassed by the nos reaction. whether no exerts cytotoxic or cytoprotective action remains unclear. we also found a significant decrease of viability, at long term, in hepatocytes subjected to bradykinin treatment. the simultaneous treatment of hepatocytes with l-name improves cell viability even if control levels are not restored. the data show that the increased no production plays a role in liver damage induction, that follows the proinflammatory mediator treatment. the hepatocellular injury attributed to no may be due either to its direct cytotoxicity or its reaction with superoxide to produce the toxic nitrogen metabolite peroxynitrite. oldenburg et al., demonstrated in other cell types, like cardiomyocytes, that bradykinin caused the increase in reactive oxygen species generation. at last, our results show that the increased no synthesis induces a reduced urea production, that is an index of cell damage. the simultaneous treatment of liver cell cultures with l-name decreases no levels and sustains overall biosynthesis activities and cell viability.  in summary, we conclude that mm bradykinin treatment induces an increase of no levels and reduction of urea synthesis in the hepatocytes. this increased no production mediates, after hours, cell toxicity as shown by mtt test. in contrast, the administration of the nos inhibitor l-name protects against cell damage and increases urea levels, suggesting that no plays a key role in the bradykinin-induced liver damage.

193," verotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h is a zoonotic pathogen spread by ruminants which are asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. strains capable of causing haemorrhagic colitis in humans are referred to as enterohaemorrhagic e. coli. the main source of human infection is cattle, but sheep are also considered a significant reservoir. a study in the uk found o157:h contamination to be more common in raw lamb meat products compared to beef. the sheep’s fleece is a potential source of bacterial contamination for the carcass at slaughter, particularly if the wool is long. dairy products such as cheese based on unpasteurized milk and environmental contamination represent other likely routes of transmission from sheep to humans. unlike in cattle, relatively little is known about the genotypic characteristics of o157:h found in sheep. recent studies in european countries have found strains with identical virulence gene profiles and phage types in bovine and ovine hosts, but with no shared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles between species. there is strong evidence that certain genetic groups of o157:h are over-represented in isolates linked to human cases of disease compared to their prevalence in cattle. the presence or absence of such groups in sheep is therefore of importance for risk assessment and epidemiological tracing. in collaboration between the swedish national veterinary institute and the swedish institute for communicable disease control, we have used molecular typing methods to compare isolates from a prevalence study performed on sheep to isolates from human patients and isolates from prevalence studies performed on cattle. we have also analysed the genotypic characteristics of strains of o157:h isolated from sheep farms linked to cases of human disease. the aim was to characterize vtec o157:h strains isolated from sheep and to determine if the same genotypes occur in sheep as in cattle and human patients.  verotoxin-producing o157:h was found in 11/ of analyzed samples from sheep in swedish slaughterhouses, 9/ faecal and 2/ ear samples. the bacterium was only found in animals less than six months old and was geographically restricted to southern sweden. while both of these observations are in agreement with data from swedish cattle, the differences were not significant in sheep due to the low number of sampled animals > months old and the low number of sampled animals in slaughterhouses in the northern part of the country. compared to what has previously been found in studies on cattle, the prevalence of vtec o157:h in swedish sheep appears to be low although this comparison is based on only eleven positive sheep samples altogether. while o157:h tends to be more frequently isolated from ear samples than faecal samples from cattle, no such difference was observed in sheep. previous studies in different european countries have reported prevalence estimates in sheep between % and %, although comparison is complicated by differences in methodology between studies. all isolates carried genes encoding intimin and haemolysin. three isolates carried cytolethal distending toxin, and had multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis profiles identifying them as closely related to a cdt-positive genetic group previously described as common and geographically widely distributed among swedish cattle. the majority of the isolates had only the verotoxin variant 2c, while a few had combinations. single nucleotide polymorphism typing revealed a single clade isolate, which carried the verotoxin variants + 2c. clade is a genetic subgroup which has caused several large outbreaks in north america and been shown to cause more severe disease compared to other types of o157:h7. compared to the overall prevalence in cattle this genotype is highly over-represented in swedish cattle farms linked to cases of human o157:h infection. most sheep isolates either belonged to lineage i/ii, or differed from this profile only by bp in yhcg. detailed results from the molecular subtyping are presented in table 1sources are specified as the prevalence study or farms linked to human cases of illness, and by county, where m = halland, i = gotland, e = Östergötland and r = skaraborg. 22c = stx2c-o157-fly16; = stx2-o157-edl ins = is1209v-like insert in the gene. 3clade status of isolates assessed by snp analysis for snp 4na = no amplicon for this locus. pfge typing found an exact match between a sheep isolate from and an isolate from a human patient in these isolates originated from the same part of the country, approximately km apart. they differed at only one of eight vntr loci in the mlva protocol. a sheep isolate from a slaughterhouse in linköping was an exact pfge match to a human patient isolate from the same town. the isolate also exactly matched three cattle isolates from samples taken in the same slaughterhouse, as well as four cattle isolates from a second slaughterhouse. the three of these seven cattle isolates that were from the slaughterhouse in linköping, the sheep isolate, and the human isolate had moderately similar mlva-profiles. there were four identical loci shared by the sheep and human isolates and four to five identical loci shared by the sheep and cattle isolates. these observations of exact pfge matches corresponding to similar but non-identical mlva profiles supports previous  that mlva profiles can be more discriminatory and presumably change more rapidly. full pfge and mlva typing data is presented in additional file the mlva profile differences, as well as the fact that the isolates were found in the different host species over a period of five years, suggests that the sheep farms in question were not directly involved with the cases of human disease. rather, it seems that clones of o157:h circulate among both sheep and cattle farms in a region with occasional transmission to humans from either of the reservoirs. both the sheep isolates matched to human isolates belonged to groups that appear to cause human disease more rarely or with less severe symptoms compared to clade one of them has a lspa- profile suggesting it belongs to lineage ii, which has been reported to occur more frequently in cattle compared to patients. mlva matching produced no exact match between sheep and human isolates. there was a single exact mlva match between sheep and two cattle isolates from a different part of the country. sheep isolates did not form any distinct clusters, by either typing method, compared to the cattle isolates. in general, the sheep isolates found in this study had characteristics very similar to the cattle isolates available for comparison, and the typing results did not support the existence of any particular subgroup of o157:h that preferentially colonized sheep. however, due to the low prevalence of o157:h in this study, these conclusions are based on very few sheep isolates compared to the extensive data available from swedish cattle and patients. "," comparatively little is known about the prevalence or the molecular characteristics of the zoonotic pathogen e. coli o157:h in the sheep reservoir. to investigate this and determine the host specificity of subclones of the bacterium, we have conducted a slaughterhouse prevalence study in sheep and compared the collected isolates to o157:h previously isolated from cattle and human patients.  verotoxin-producing o157:h was found in 11/ of samples from sheep in swedish slaughterhouses, 9/ faecal and 2/ ear samples. all positive sheep were < months old. pulsed field gel electrophoresis typing revealed exact matches between isolates from the sheep prevalence study and human patients as well as between isolates from sheep and cattle. in one case, matching isolates were found in sheep, cattle, and a human patient in the same municipality. identical pfge profiles generally corresponded to similar but non-identical multi-locus vntr profiles. in one sheep sample, snp-typing found the highly virulent clade variant of o157:h the virulence gene profiles of sheep isolates from the prevalence study and three sheep farms linked to cases of human illness were investigated by pcr detection, and partial sequencing of vtx the observed profiles were similar to those of cattle strains investigated previously.  the same pathogenic subtypes of vtec o157:h including the highly virulent clade appear to be present in both sheep and cattle in sweden, suggesting strains can circulate freely between ruminant reservoirs. o157:h7vtecstecsheepmlvapfgeclade 8 ",f7af8688-3d10-4171-bfca-5d9af1e39eca,pubmed
194," application of transcranial direct current stimulation to the cortex has been shown to shift the membrane potential of superficial neurons in a de- or hyperpolarizing direction, and to modulate spontaneous neuronal activity as well as the processing of afferent signals. anodal stimulation, i.e., stimulation with electrodes of positive charge, causes via an extracellular negative sink in underlying neural tissue a depolarization of the membrane potential, whereas cathodal stimulation hyperpolarizes the neurons. a recent in vitro study using a cortical slice preparation showed that pyramidal cells oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface, i.e., closely parallel to the dc field, can be readily polarized. at the behavioral level in animals anodal stimulation of the cortical surface has been associated with facilitation of an unconditioned response and improved learning. in humans, anodal polarization increased excitability measures of the motor and visual cortex, improved motor learning, decreased response latencies and increased verbal fluency. the present study analizes the ability of tdcs, with electrodes overlaying lateral prefrontal cortex, to modulate activity within cortical networks underlying working memory using the sternberg paradigm. working memory refers to a set of basic mental operations which define the ability to hold an item of information transiently in mind, in order to recall, manipulate and/or associate this information to other ideas and incoming new information. working memory is assumed to involve a number of subsystems. sustained neuronal activity up to several tens of seconds in the prefrontal cortex, but also in other areas e.g., parietal cortex is hereby an essential correlate of working memory operations. the generation of this persistent activity has been modeled mostly through recurrent excitatory networks, although it may also rely on specific changes in intrinsic membrane properties. working memory and the effect of memory load are well assessed in the sternberg paradigm which requires subjects to maintain in memory a set of initially presented items and compare these with a probe. subsequently, individual items are presented and subjects have to perform a fast button press response indicating whether the presented item belongs to the set or not. changes in reaction time as a function of memory load are attributed to a manipulation of working memory. in the eeg and meg frontal theta and gamma activity are enhanced during the retention and scanning periods of working memory. an event-related sustained negative potential shift recorded from fronto-cortical scalp locations also represents a close electrophysiological correlate of memory load.  reaction time reaction time was increased for both tdcs polarities as compared to placebo. reaction times in response to anodal vs. cathodal tdcs, however, did not differ significantly. fig. reveals mean reaction times of the sternberg task for all three conditions and memory set sizes. in the sternberg task reaction time increases linearly with the number of items in the memory set. this linear increase in reaction time with increased memory load corresponds to the slope of the reaction time function. the reaction time at the zero intercept of this function is attributed to processes independent of set size such as response selection and preparation. since slopes and zero intercepts of the reaction time functions for anodal and cathodal tdcs conditions did not differ significantly statistics are given for collapsed data only. as is typical for the sternberg task reaction time increased for larger set sizes, i.e. for increased memory load. a major finding is that slopes did not differ between tdcs conditions and sham-tdcs indicating that tdcs did not effect time required for memory scanning. the above data also show that slopes for negative and positive probes did not differ statistically in line with sternberg's hypothesis that a serial exhaustive search processes is taking place. for both negative and positive response types zero intercepts for tdcs were higher than for sham-tdcs reflecting an increased time required for response selection and preparation with tdcs. positive responses revealed higher zero intercepts than negative responses. for positive responses the zero intercepts were at ± ms for tdcs and at ± ms for sham-tdcs, and for negative responses at ± ms for tdcs and at ± ms for sham-tdcs. the faster reaction time to negative than positive probes is due to the greater probability of negative probes. in supplementary analyses with the same sternberg task repetitive anodal tdcs applied unilaterally rather than bilaterally at left and right fronto-cortical regions during separate sessions also showed a tendency to reduce reaction time as compared to sham stimulation. as in the main experiment slopes did not differ between tdcs conditions and sham-tdcs. error rate tdcs did not affect error rate. subjects performed the task with only few errors, whereby the mean number of incorrect responses to positive probes was larger than to negative probes. nevertheless, the overall error rate across all conditions was low, %. for positive responses only, there was a statistical trend for an interaction between set size and response type showing an increase in the number of errors with working memory load. errors for the set size of items occurred more frequent than errors for the set size of one and two items. discussion this study shows that both cathodal as well as anodal tdcs polarization applied at lateral prefronto-cortical locations slowed reaction time in a sternberg item recognition task equally for all set sizes tested. despite overall slower reaction time during tdcs the slope for reaction time with increasing set size was not significantly altered by tdcs. this suggests, that contrary to our expectation tdcs influenced more directly processes related to response selection than operations in working memory. however, attempts to localize underlying processes and structures suggest these processes may not be as separable as originally suggested by sternberg. the absence of an effect of tdcs on error rate in our study is attributed to the rather low error rate across all conditions presumably associated with a ""floor"" effect. interestingly, the slowing effect of tdcs on reaction time contrasts findings in another study in which anodal tdcs improved reaction time. however, the two studies differ in several aspects: firstly, in the location of stimulation. the facilitatory effect on reaction time found by elbert and co-workers was obtained when anodal tdcs was applied at the vertex close to the supplementary motor area. it may therefore be argued that the direction of intracortical current flow induced by our bilateral anodal tdcs at fronto-lateral sites was responsible for the impairment of reaction time. yet, reversing current flow in our study, i.e., cathodal tdcs also impaired reaction time. thus, the difference in stimulation location is probably not the sole reason for the discrepancy in the effects. second, our stimulation protocol differed from that of elbert and co-workers. in our study stimulation occurred in an intermittent manner, and was not event-related. the finding that both tdcs polarities had a decremental effect on reaction time furthermore suggests that this effect is to be attributed to the intermittent application mode of both anodal and cathodal tdcs. this intermittent tdcs protocol was chosen, on the one hand, for safety reasons. in order to stimulate during the complete sternberg task a duration of min was required. however studies to date have not used or evaluated safety effects of continuous tdcs for such a long duration. on the other hand, exactly the same intermittent stimulation protocol has been applied effectively in a previous study of ours resulting in improved sleep-dependent consolidation of memory. thus, the presumed fluctuating shifts in the membrane potentials of cortical neurons induced by our intermittent tdcs protocol could interfere with temporal dynamics of processing. a critical role of a finely tuned temporal pattern of neuronal processing is suggested by the event-related or time-locked slow negative cortical potentials during working memory operations including response selection and preparation. moreover, as mentioned above working memory operations including response selection are associated with modulations in oscillatory activity, in particular enhanced theta activity, and thus with the underlying finely tuned intercellular cortical activity. the ability of tdcs to influence oscillatory cortical network activity has been reported previously. with regard to theta activity, some recent findings lend themselves to speculation that the decreasing influence of tdcs on these oscillations involves a detrimental effect on cholinergic afferent input to the upper neocortical layer i. taken together, interference with endogenous eeg rhythms and/or slow potential activity linked to task associated network activity is suggested to have caused the poorer response latency with tdcs. here, it should be underlined that the cortical networks underlying response selection which were presumably influenced by tdcs rather than other working memory operations are functions involved in many other types of cognitive tasks. furthermore, common regions of the human frontal lobe are recruited by different cognitive demands. the low spatial selectivity of tdcs and the different engagement of frontal sub-regions in working memory operations including response selection may be a confounding factor in our study. our results, however, are in line with findings of studies on working memory with fmri and rtms, methods of much higher spatial resolution than tdcs, indicating that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in response selection. the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is concurrently involved in the active manipulation of information within working memory, but in humans the neuronal networks of these functions appear not to be identical. the effect on response selection and preparation rather than working memory in the present study may thus have been related as well to the specific location of the stimulating electrodes and direction of current flow within the stimulated cortical region. also, during the task networks underlying response related processes may have shown greater susceptibility to tdcs. on the other hand, it cannot be excluded that increased memory load exceeding the relatively low load used in our task may have rendered the working memory networks more susceptible to the modulatory effects of tdcs.  our data show that tdcs applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rather than affecting working memory interfered with response selection and preparation. this result is attributed to a disturbance by intermittent tdcs of endogenous task-related cortical oscillatory activity. both stimulation polarities caused fluctuating shifts in the membrane potentials of cortical neurons independent of the endogenous activity which seems to have interfered with the time-locked selection and/or generation of the response. the new finding is that tdcs modulated the excitability and activity of cortical networks which are involved in response selection and probably also in other types of cognitive tasks. whether intermittent tdcs exerts a facilitatory or suppressing effect on central nervous information processing may depend upon the behavioral context, and associated requirements regarding the temporal dynamics of processing within the underlying networks. "," weak transcortical direct current stimulation applied to the cortex can shift the membrane potential of superficial neurons thereby modulating cortical excitability and activity. here we test the possibility of modifying ongoing activity associated with working memory by tdcs. the concept of working memory applies to a system that is capable of transiently storing and manipulating information, as an integral part of the human memory system. we applied anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation bilaterally at fronto-cortical electrode sites on the scalp over min repeatedly as well as sham-tdcs while subjects performed a modified sternberg task.  reaction time linearly increased with increasing set size. the slope of this increase was closely comparable for real and sham stimulation indicating that our real stimulation did not effect time required for memory scanning. however, reaction time was slowed during both anodal and cathodal stimulation as compared to placebo indicating that real stimulation hampered neuronal processing related to response selection and preparation.  intermittent tdcs over lateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task impairs central nervous processing related to response selection and preparation. we conclude that this decrease in performance by our protocol of intermittent stimulation results from an interference mainly with the temporal dynamics of cortical processing as indexed by event-related sustained and oscillatory eeg activity such as theta.

195," neuroblastoma is the second commonest solid cancer in young children accounting for 9% of all childhood cancers. it is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical behaviour ranging from spontaneous regression in 10% of all cases to rapid progression with unfavourable prognosis. amplified mycn leading to high mycn mrna and protein levels plays an important role in nb biology and is used as a powerful prognostic marker in nb risk stratification. in addition, several other genetic abnormalities, including gain of 17q, 11q and 1p deletion have been associated with an aggressive nb phenotype. further, microarray technology has been used to study gene expression profiles in primary nbs. patterns of differentially expressed genes among different nb subtypes as well as gene expression classifiers have emerged allowing a better prediction of patient's outcome than established risk markers. mirnas that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level have been described to play a role in carcinogenesis via executing oncogenic or tumour suppressive functions. for example, let- mirnas are down-regulated in lung cancer and are known to target proto-oncogene ras transcripts. mir-17- cistron is to be overexpressed in human lung cancer and upregulated by c-myc. mir- and mir- are frequently deleted and down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemias. the expression profiles of a small set of mirnas could be used to classify different types of cancer. more recently, profiling of a subset of known mirnas in neuroblastoma specimens suggested that mycn acts as a regulator of mirnas. however, the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in different cancer types, including neuroblastoma, is not yet available. prognosis-relevant mirnas with putative oncogenic functions could have been missed in previous cloning efforts due to their silent state or low-expression. there is evidence to date that neural lineage cells are particularly rich in mirna diversity. in this study, we aimed at cloning novel mirnas from nb cell lines and nb specimens that may have a role in nb biology. here, we present the analysis of small rna libraries derived from neuroblastoma tumour specimens and cell lines and suggest several novel mirnas. some of these mirnas reside within loci of cancer-associated rearrangements and are of special interest for future studies.  mirna cloning and abundance of previously annotated mirnas for nb mirna library construction, we used rna derived from tumour samples as well as two neuroblastoma cell lines, sh-ep and kelly. we followed the guidelines of lau et al. ensuring that only those rna species were cloned which contained 5'-phosphate. the following cohort of tumours was used for cloning: four mycn amplified, three stage 4s mycn single-copy, two stage mycn single-copy and four stage mycn single-copy tumours. * nb stage was evaluated according to inss criteria approximately clones per specimen or cell line were sequenced. after linker unmasking, small rna cdna sequences were subjected to further analyses. the percentage of ""not-known-mirna"" sequences varied from 18% to 60% which corresponds to previously described fractions of other non-coding rnas, redundant sequences as well as novel mirnas in small rna libraries. our cloning project covered 27% of mirnas currently present in the public mirna registry. mirnas were represented by only one read. on the other hand, mir-124a and -125b yielded and reads, respectively. mirna cloning was established as an independent semi-quantitative method to evaluate mirna abundance. this allowed us to conclude that mir-124a and -125b were the most abundant ones. both mirnas are considered as having neuronal specificity. among the most frequently identified mirnas was mir-, a transcript with putative anti-apoptotic and tumour promoting activities. a difference in the abundance of certain mirnas was observed in mycn-amplified and non-amplified specimens. in mycn-amplified tumours/cell line, we observed a higher abundance of mirnas from the mir-17/ cluster that is known to be up-regulated by c-myc. the average numbers for hsa-mir-17-5p and hsa-mir-20a reads in mycn-amplified and single-copy specimens were versus and versus, respectively. a group of mirna sequences that clustered on chromosome was exclusively found in the library of the mycn amplified tumour, mycnamp_nb this argues for a cistronic manner of transcription of this group of mirna sequences. beside annotated human mirnas we have cloned sequences that have been originally identified in rat and mouse. identification and validation of new mirnas after removing redundant sequences and the sequences derived from other non-coding rnas, the remaining pool was checked in silico for the detection of the putative mirna precursors using mirpredict. this analysis yielded distinct sequences which were classified as mirnas. of these mirnas, sequences were mirna* forms of previously annotated mirna precursors. hsa-mir- was cloned by the velculescu group, but then excluded from mirbase due to overlap with a trna gene. cloning of the 594* species described here provides evidence for the mirna nature of these sequences. notes give the information which hairpin arm expresses the mirna* form. other sequences represent novel small rnas which have not been annotated. two novel sequences were found adjacent to chromosomal localisations of known mirnas: mycnsc_nb5_ within a mirna cluster on chromosome as well as mycnamp_nb2_ within a mirna cluster on chromosome. phylogenetic conservation was determined for each putative mirna and its surrounding with respect to chimpanzee, macaque, opossum, mouse, rat, dog, bull and chicken genomes. we found that the cloned sequences with the exception of mycnamp_nb4_ are conserved either within all chosen species or primates. the non-conserved mycnamp_nb4_ sequence seems to be the result of a short duplication within an intron of the dpp transcript. however, homologous regions in chimpanzee and macaque genomes are also able to form hairpins which might give rise to mirnas. novel mirnas do not share any homology with each other and therefore do not comprise a family. searching against mirbase revealed that none of the new mirnas are related to the annotated mirnas in mirbase, except of one sequence, mycnamp_nb2_ that is homologous to hsa-mir- and - analysis of genomic locations of the individual mirnas showed that of them are localized in extragenic regions. sequences are found within introns of coding transcripts. mycnsc_nb5_ classified as a mirna by mirpredict, is found within a predicted u gene which reduces reliability of this sequence as a mirna. the likely precursors of the novel mirnas may be subdivided into two subgroups: structures with typical hairpin or borderline precursors. the latter subgroup has features divergent from a canonical mirna hairpin, such as bulges, short stem or ""oscillating"" hairpin, where the candidate mirna can reside on the 5' or 3'-arm. lui et al. reported the cloning of a subset of non-canonical mirnas, however the relevance of such rnas to the classical mirna pathway remains to be determined. notes include the information about genomic locations and additional sequence information. based on the data listed above, we subjected new mirnas to northern blot validation using biotinylated probes. borderline case mycnsc_nb5_ sequences were not further examined. the expression of each putative mirna was checked in a panel of human tissues, including different tumour specimens, normal brain, adrenal gland, spleen and skeletal muscle tissues. of cloned mirna* sequences and sequences from individual hairpins were northern blot positive. the other sequences remained undetectable. the probe for mycnsc_nb5_ yielded a signal around nt which is higher than the estimated sequence size. the probes for contig_chr_ mycnsc_nb5_ and mycnamp_nb2_ yielded several bands different in length by 1– nucleotides. some known mirnas show such patterns in northern blot analyses and intermediate products of mirna maturation have been observed, but there is no comprehensive explanation for these results. in normal tissues, northern blot-positive mirnas are preferentially expressed in brain, skeletal muscle tissue and adrenal gland, being less frequently expressed in spleen. the detection of mirnas in skeletal muscle might be due to the presence of motor neurons. several mirnas showed differential expression in normal versus tumour specimens: contig_chr_ kelly_ mycnamp_nb2_ were expressed in tumours, but not in normal tissues. on the other hand, we did not find mycnamp_nb2_ mirna in tumour specimens, but we found strong expression of this sequence in brain.  recently, several studies have been performed aiming at directional cloning of tissue/tumour specific mirnas. the importance of such an approach is highlighted by the fact that patterns of novel mirnas from tumours of different lineages hardly overlap and may include mirnas with a functional role in tumourigenesis. our study provides evidence for new human mirnas cloned from neuroblastoma. of them were originally cloned from other species and have not been annotated in the human mirna database. sequences represent mirna* species of previously annotated sequences. sequences, which have not been annotated before, are suggested to be novel mirnas. some of these mirnas are found within regions of chromosomal rearrangements associated with cancer. for example, new mirnas on 9p residing within nb-related aberration region are of special interest for future studies. mirna profiling of these novel sequences will allow us to clarify their relevance in nb development, progression and regression. "," micrornas are a novel class of gene expression regulators implicated in cancer biology. neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumour consisting of neural crest-derived undifferentiated cells and is characterised by variable clinical courses ranging from spontaneous regression to therapy-resistant progression. recent advances identified a subset of mirnas with putative function in nb biology. however, the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in nbs is not available.  we describe mirna profiles of nb specimens and nb cell lines as determined by mirna cloning. a total of sequences were sequenced and analysed by a mirna prediction tool. our library covered 27% mirnas known to date. reads corresponding to individual sequences were classified as novel mirnas, including mirna* species of known mirnas. expression of new mirna* forms and individual sequences was supported by northern blotting. most of the novel mirna genes are not related to each other and do not share homology with the annotated sequences in the public mirna database, but they are conserved within mammals or have close homologues in primates genomes.  we provide evidence for new mirna and mirna-like sequences. some of these newly identified sequences reside within frequently altered chromosomal regions in nb tumours and may play a role in nb biology.

196," in the last several years, virtual screening has become an accepted tool in drug discovery. it has been successfully applied in a number of therapeutic programs, in particular, at the lead discovery stage, where high-throughput molecular docking can play an important role. in concert with the continued need for improvements of in silico docking accuracies, the explosive growth of commercial and publicly available chemical databases requires computational techniques to efficiently implement docking protocols and rapidly screen millions of compounds in a timely fashion. here, we are focusing on the techniques to enable large scale docking using linux-based hpc platforms. several commercial docking programs, such as glide, ligandfit and flexx, can distribute docking jobs to computers over the network. however, protocols that can seamlessly dock millions of compounds and capture the top percentage of high-scoring ligands are not standard. there are two major requirements for such a protocol running on a linux cluster: the ability to launch parallel docking jobs through a queuing system; and the ability to process millions of compounds in a reasonable time. since the latter requirement may call for hundreds of central processing units working simultaneously, the protocol should effectively handle the associated data flow through the file system without affecting the performance of the cluster. in this note, we describe a linux cluster-based protocol using autodock as the docking engine. autodock is a widely used docking program developed at the scripps research institute. application of autodock requires several separate pre-docking steps, e.g., ligand preparation, receptor preparation, and grid map calculations, before the actual docking process can take place. existing tools, such as autodock tools and bdt, integrate individual autodock steps within a graphical user interface, and provide automated features for docking runs. however, they do not contain the capability to effectively process millions of compounds in a single execution. at the autodock website, there is a tutorial with scripts to teach users how to use autodock and how to employ unix commands to perform virtual screening. in the tutorial, first a user needs to manually prepare the receptor, ligands, energy grids and a list of ligands names; then every compound in the list is looped through by a shell script, where the compound can be docked either by executing autodock commands inside the loop or by submitting the corresponding commands to a queuing system. this approach works well for thousands of compounds, however, it may not work for millions of compounds due to the limitations of the file and queuing systems. concurrently, autodock has also been used in grid-computing projects, fightaids@home and wisdom. in a grid-computing infrastructure, tens to hundreds of thousand cpus are used to setup a computational grid. through specialized middleware, servers in a grid can schedule jobs, send applications and data to a cpu, and retrieve results. because of the large number of cpus involved, the computational power of a grid is phenomenal. for example, in the wisdom project, million docking experiments were performed using autodock in days. however, due to the nature of its infrastructure, the job success rate was 65% and the percentage of time spent running the application was ~50%. on the other hand, using a dedicated hpc platform with specialized software tools for autodock, it is possible to screen millions of compounds in a reasonable time at a much higher job success rate and cpu efficiency. here, we describe a docking-based virtual screening pipeline, based on autodock, where perl and shell scripts are used to integrate executables and scripts from adt, openbabel and autodock. this implementation has the following advantages: a scalable parallelization scheme for autodock integrated with queuing systems, such as the load sharing facility, platform computing inc. and the portable batch system, altair grid technologies; a protocol to retain user-specified top percentage of docked ligands based on their docking scores; a x-window's-based gui for users to specify docking parameters, submit docking jobs and query/visualize docked ligands; and a collection of pre-processed compounds from the zinc database and the national cancer institute diversity dataset in native autodock pdbq format. implementation a high-throughput screening campaign typically has many more ligands than the number of cpus available. in this case, a straightforward approach to process the ligands is via a parallelization scheme where the input ligands are divided into n equal partitions corresponding to the number of cpus available for docking. for each cpu, a single partition of ligands is docked to the target receptor. after all docking jobs are completed, the results from the n cpus are consolidated and the final top m scoring ligands are returned to the user for further analysis. the input parameters for screening are specified via a gui, which creates one master parameter file that is used to drive all related scripts and programs. inside dovis there are three distinct implementation steps, pre-docking, parallel docking, and post-docking, which are integrated with a queuing system. pre-docking in this step, the receptor is converted to the native autodock format and the ligands are partitioned into n files. dovis accepts receptors with all hydrogen atoms specified in standard pdb or mol format. a python script, ""prepare_receptor.py"" from adt, is used to convert the receptor into the pdbqs format required by autodock. the acceptable input formats for ligands include sd, mol and pdbq. when the ligand is provided in the sd format, it is converted into mol by openbabel. the mol files are then partitioned into n files with roughly the same number of molecules in each file. if the input ligands are provided as pre-processed pdbq files, the list of ligand file names is simply partitioned into n lists of roughly equal length. parallel docking from the previous step, either a ligand file or a list of ligands is assigned to each cpu, where the ligands in each set are separately processed and docked to the receptor, one ligand at a time per cpu. for ligands in the mol format, a python script, ""prepare_ligand.py"" from adt, is used to generate the corresponding pdbq file. we pre-compute energy grid maps for all possible ligand atom types at the beginning of each parallel job. thus, any grid map needed by autodock can be directly loaded without a separate calculation. after each docking, the docking log-file is parsed by a perl script to extract the ""estimated free energy of binding,"" which is used as the criterion to select the top m scoring dlg files from each cpu. during testing, we found that there are more than file operations and over mb of data flow associated with the docking of each ligand. if a network file system is used with more than cpus running concurrently, the data flow degrades the performance of the entire linux cluster. to overcome this problem, dovis provides the option to use the local disk drive on each node or cpu to store the energy grid maps and other intermediate files. post-docking after all docking jobs are completed, a perl script is used to combine all saved results from each cpu and to collect the top m scoring ligands from the consolidated list as the final result. the dlg files of all selected top-scoring ligands are collected and compressed into a directory. queue integration on large linux clusters with distributed memory, it is essential to integrate dovis with a queuing system. with the job dependency support of a queuing system, the three steps discussed above can be sequentially executed and parallel jobs can be automatically launched. for the parallel docking job, at each cpu, the same executables are used to process different ligands. this computational strategy is most efficiently handled by queuing systems that support the functionality to bundle many single-processor jobs using the same executables into a single job, typically referred to as job array. thus, dovis is suitable for any queuing system that supports job array and job dependency. currently, we have integrated dovis with the lsf and the pbs queuing systems. in order to run dovis on linux clusters without a queuing system, we provide a version of dovis that uses multi-threading to run parallel docking jobs. this scheme is especially suitable for shared-memory linux clusters. there is another issue related to shared queuing systems. usually, every job in the queue has a runtime limit. once the limit is reached, the job is terminated. when docking large number of ligands, job array may not be able to complete all tasks within the allowed runtime limit. therefore, we implemented a restart function, which tracks the progress of each cpu and gives the user the option to manually restart dovis from where it left off. graphic user interface a gui was developed for dovis using java swing to provide a convenient way to specify the target receptor, the ligand database and the docking parameters. using the gui, users are also able to submit the job to the queuing system. in addition, the jmol molecular viewer is embedded in the gui to enable visualization of docked ligands with the target receptor.  in order to build a ligand database for testing and scientific research purpose, we pre-processed the zinc database and the nci diversity dataset into autodock pdbq format. using the pre-processed zinc database, we tested how many ligands dovis could dock to a receptor per day with varying numbers of cpus. we performed tests with up to cpus on a linux cluster and observed a near-linear speedup as a function of number of cpus, for the zinc database. this indicates that our implementation achieves near-optimal performance. in addition, we carried out the virtual screening of the zinc database against the ricin a chain as a receptor target with cpus. the task was completed in days, corresponding to ~ ligands per cpu per day, with two manual restarts due to a four-day runtime limit in our queuing system. see additional file for the detailed parameter choices. discussion we developed dovis as a utility software to automate docking jobs with autodock. it can reliably screen millions of compounds against a receptor and automatically save the top percentage of high-scoring hits. the parallelization scheme employed here provides a straightforward approach to such a problem. when all cpus are started around the same time, this scheme works well and all cpus shall complete their jobs at about the same time. however, when the queuing system does not allow all cpus to be launched at the same time, with the equal number of ligands assigned to each cpu, the efficiency of dovis is compromised. this may become a problem with a queuing system when a large number of cpus are requested for a calculation. to solve this problem, the number of ligands assigned to each cpu should be re-distributed in a way that the cpus launched earlier shall docked more ligands than the cpus launched later. currently, we are working on an improvement to address this issue.  using autodock as its docking engine, dovis provides an automated parallel docking package that is integrated with a queuing system. this application is suitable for conducting large-scale high-throughput virtual screening on linux cluster platforms. the dovis package is freely available. authors' contributions sz implemented and tested the software. kk implemented the gui and tested

investigated. in addition to the selection of a sound docking strategy with appropriate scoring functions, another technical challenge is to in silico screen millions of compounds in a reasonable time. to meet this challenge, it is necessary to use high performance computing platforms and techniques. however, the development of an integrated hpc system that makes efficient use of its elements is not trivial.  we have developed an application termed dovis that uses autodock as the docking engine and runs in parallel on a linux cluster. dovis can efficiently dock large numbers of small molecules to a receptor, screening to compounds per processor per day. furthermore, in dovis, the docking session is fully integrated and automated in that the inputs are specified via a graphical user interface, the calculations are fully integrated with a linux cluster queuing system for parallel processing, and the results can be visualized and queried.  dovis removes most of the complexities and organizational problems associated with large-scale high-throughput virtual screening, and provides a convenient and efficient solution for autodock users to use this software in a linux cluster platform.

197," the use of complete genomes for phylogenetic analysis has greatly improved our understanding of prokaryote evolution. however, until recently, relatively few complete genome sequences were available for such analyses in eukaryotes. as this improves, there will be a greater demand on methodology for evolutionary analysis of complete genomes. previous whole-genome studies of eukaryotes have focused on gene and gene family presence-absence, lineage-specific gene loss, insertion-deletion markers and introns, and other non-sequence based information. while these approaches have their advantages, previous studies have not used complete genome sequences for reconstructing evolutionary relationships. at the same time, the complexity of eukaryote genomes, with numerous gene duplications and losses in different lineages, has created a challenge for sequence-based phylogeny estimation. here, we outline a conservative approach designed to utilize the wealth of evolutionary information present in complete genome sequences by identifying orthologs in multiple eukaryotes for the purpose of evolutionary analysis. methods for the identification of clusters of orthologs and lineage-specific paralogs have proven useful for classifying gene function and identifying cases where genes have been differentially lost or duplicated in different lineages. however, such assemblages of data contain a mixture of orthologs, paralogs, and missing data as a result of gene loss, and are not generally suitable for large-scale phylogenetic sequence analysis of organismal evolution. our approach for comparing multiple genome sequences involves the identification of single-copy orthologs across a number of genomes for evolutionary analysis. we refer to such strict orthologs as panorthologs, in reference to their presumed ""complete"" orthology, in contrast to synorthologs, which contain a mixture of species divergences and gene duplication events. in other words, panorthologs are those genes that contain only species divergences and do not contain in-paralogs, out-paralogs, or co-orthologs. on the other hand, synorthologs are those genes that contain species divergences and any combination of paralogy. while the use of panorthologs is conservative and reduces the number of usable genes or proteins, it also lowers the probability that errors will be made in confusing a species divergence with a gene duplication event. because the ability to identify orthologs is diminished in analyses of small to moderate numbers of species or genomes, such a conservative method is appropriate in those cases. this conservative approach has been used to identify the number of shared, unduplicated proteins in homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it was determined that such proteins perform primarily anabolic rather than catabolic functions. we compare our phylogenetic results and divergence time estimates for an analysis of seventeen published eukaryote genomes to a previous study that assembled nuclear protein sequence data in a more conventional manner from public databases. while the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms included in this study are not controversial, with the exception of the position of nematodes, this general approach will prove useful as more genomes, including those with questionable phylogenetic affinity, are sequenced. in addition, this approach facilitates the estimation of divergence times between organisms with numerous molecular clock methods.  the number of orthologous clusters per pairwise comparison and the percentage of those clusters showing panorthology are presented in table on average, pairwise orthologous clusters contained approximately % panorthologs; exceptions include comparisons between fungi, including encephalitozoon, and all comparisons with arabidopsis. comparisons within metazoans averaged % panorthology, with mus and rattus showing the highest number of shared transcripts as expected due to their recent evolutionary divergence. previous analyses showed approximately panorthologs between mus and rattus. caenorhabditis elegans and c. briggsae, who diverged roughly ma, also shared a large number of transcripts, which is similar to a previous estimate of panorthologs. the number of orthologous clusters between drosophila and anopheles found here is also similar to a previous estimate of approximately panorthologs. pairwise comparisons with the smallest genome, the guillardia nucleomorph, averaged ~ orthologous clusters, but the percentage of panorthologs varied greatly, from a low of % with arabidopsis to as high as % with encephalitozoon. the intersection of nine metazoan genomes resulted in a large number of shared genes. among the nine genomes, panorthologs were found, totaling amino acids. the neighbor-joining tree of that concatenation is shown in figure 2; all nodes in this tree received 100% bootstrap support. the intersection of all seventeen eukaryote genomes included in this study resulted in three shared genes and orthology was confirmed manually. the reconstructed trees for the three genes showed long-branch attraction errors associated with the intracellular parasite encephalitozoon and the guillardia nucleomorph. this was expected because both have highly reduced genomes and high rates of substitution across many genes as a result of their current or ancestral parasitic and symbiotic lifestyles. for this reason, the intersection of the remaining fifteen genomes was determined, resulting in ten panorthologs. the intersection of genomes from twelve multicellular eukaryotes resulted in panorthologs. the functional classifications of the panorthologs found here are similar to those identified in previous studies, with the most frequently represented functions being transcription, translation, replication and repair, and rna processing. the phylogenetic trees reconstructed from the concatenated datasets both showed the expected relationships. all nodes in these trees received very high bootstrap support, with only one node showing less than 95% bootstrap support. the long branch observed in plasmodium may be the result of both the long evolutionary separation from the other eukaryotes included in this study, and the high composition of the genome leading to biased amino acid compositions among proteins. phylogenetic trees were also reconstructed for each panortholog to test for congruence with well-supported phylogenies from the concatenated data. we found that in most cases, the consensus values calculated from individual trees agree with the high bootstrap support of the concatenated analysis. two exceptions were the low consensus values for the accepted close relationship between animals and fungi and the contested position of nematodes. both taxa showed slightly longer branch lengths, and long-branch attraction artifacts may be affecting the individual datasets, causing low consensus values. also, recent empirical and simulation studies suggest that results from multigene analyses are more accurate when a tree is derived from a concatenated dataset of individual genes rather than a consensus of trees from multiple analyses. divergence times were estimated for both the 15-genome and 12-genome datasets. results were consistent with previous studies, showing an early divergence between plants, animals, and fungi, and a precambrian origin for animals. to specifically address the deuterostome-arthropod divergence within animals, two additional datasets were assembled to maximize the number of proteins analyzed: the intersection of seven genomes and the intersection of four genomes. the seven genome intersection contained panorthologs, and yielded a vertebrate-arthropod divergence time of ma. the four genome intersection contained panorthologs and yielded a vertebrate-arthropod divergence time of ~ ma. although this last estimate was derived from more than five times the data previously used, the divergence time is remarkably consistent with previous large-scale studies, and suggests that bilaterian animals originated hundreds of millions of years before the first fossil evidence of their existence in the cambrian. with the exception of the maximum fossil-based time estimate used in the tetrapod-actinopterygian fish calibration, the other fossil constraints used here are minimums, and therefore the resulting time estimates are minimums. the agreement between our results and those of previous studies using different methods of data assembly suggests that our genome intersection approach is correctly assembling orthologs. younger time estimates of the vertebrate-arthropod divergence have been obtained in some studies. however, those results are problematic because they also contain estimates which are inconsistent with undisputed aspects of the fossil record, such as the oldest red algae, green algae, and stramenopiles. possible reasons for their inconsistency are discussed elsewhere. discussion the complete genome sequence of an organism is essentially the maximum amount of discrete, genetically encoded information available for evolutionary analyses. however, orthology determination has been a major obstacle in the analysis of complete genomes, especially in eukaryotes where considerable gene duplication and loss has created additional complexity. our approach for evolutionary analysis of complete eukaryote genome sequences is both simple and fast compared with the conventional method of gene-by-gene orthology determination using similarity searches in the public databases. the results of this approach applied to a subset of the available eukaryote genomes show agreement with previous results using conventional approaches. in addition, the relatively high consensus values for most nodes indicate general agreement in tree topology among individual panorthologs. the relatively low number of common genes in our intersections of 12– genomes is a combination of using panorthologs and including distantly related species. genes are more likely to duplicate over long periods of evolutionary time, as in the time elapsed since plants separated from animals. therefore, a better approach with such distantly related species, and those groups with high levels of gene duplication and gene loss, would be to relax the orthology criterion and include synorthologs. in that case, a representative or consensus sequence may be chosen from among in-paralogs. on the other hand, the implementation used here should yield many genes in analyses of genomes from closely related species, even if large numbers of species are used. the use of sequence data for comparative genomics and phylogenetics has several advantages over the use of datasets based on the presence and absence or position of genes, introns and insertions. sequence data can provide a larger number of characters for analysis, yielding hundreds of thousands of amino acid sites and more than a million nucleotide sites in some cases. also, statistical models of sequence change are better known than those for non-sequence based data. finally, the assembly of sequence data from complete genomes of multiple organisms not only facilitates phylogenetic and divergence time analyses, but a diversity of other comparative evolutionary analyses requiring sequence information.  unlike previous studies of complete eukaryote genomes, here we have used a fast, conservative approach to assemble orthologous clusters of proteins for phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation. our results are similar to previous studies that used conventional gene-by-gene data mining. we find that complete genome sequences support the close evolutionary relationship between animals and fungi, and also that molecular divergences between animals occurred approximately million years before the cambrian explosion of fossils. our approach will be further tested as more eukaryote genomes are sequenced. "," gene duplication and gene loss during the evolution of eukaryotes have hindered attempts to estimate phylogenies and divergence times of species. although current methods that identify clusters of orthologous genes in complete genomes have helped to investigate gene function and gene content, they have not been optimized for evolutionary sequence analyses requiring strict orthology and complete gene matrices. here we adopt a relatively simple and fast genome comparison approach designed to assemble orthologs for evolutionary analysis. our approach identifies single-copy genes representing only species divergences in order to minimize potential errors caused by gene duplication. we apply this approach to complete sets of proteins from published eukaryote genomes specifically for phylogeny and time estimation.  despite the conservative criterion used, panorthologs were identified for evolutionary analysis with four genomes, resulting in a single alignment of amino acids. with this data set, we estimate that the divergence between deuterostomes and arthropods took place in the precambrian, approximately million years before the first appearance of animals in the fossil record. additional analyses were performed with seven, and eukaryote genomes resulting in similar divergence time estimates and phylogenies.  our results with available eukaryote genomes agree with previous results using conventional methods of sequence data assembly from genomes. they show that large sequence data sets can be generated relatively quickly and efficiently for evolutionary analyses of complete genomes.

198," estrogens’ effects in focal cerebral ischemia have been a matter of debate for more than a decade. among studies performed in humans, the early epidemiological studies, indicating decreased stroke incidence from peri-menopausal hormone therapy, starkly contrasted later randomized controlled trials, such as the women’s health initiative. in an effort to explain the discrepant results, the window of opportunity hypothesis has been propagated, stating that estrogen therapy may be detrimental after a longer period of hypoestrogenicity. to complement the human studies, a large number of animal studies have been devoted to investigate the impact of estrogens on artificially induced ischemic stroke. even if the vast majority of animal studies have reported protection from estrogens, there are some studies where the hormone has been observed to increase infarction, thus paralleling the dichotomy among human studies. the most popular suggestions to explain the discordant results in animal studies has, in analogy with the human studies, been that differences in length of wash-out time between ovariectomy and estrogen administration or animal age are the responsible factors. in a systematic analysis from our lab suggested that the use of different estrogen administration modes may explain the dichotomous results from the animal studies. although such a hypothesis may seem less attractive because it is not readily extrapolated to the human studies, where the range of tested dosages and administration modes is extremely narrow, the fact that all animal studies that reported damage from estrogen used the same type of estrogen administration seemed an unlikely coincidence. in the studies included in the former systematic analysis, the only administration mode capable of rendering estrogens damaging was a type of subcutaneous slow-release pellet, which has been demonstrated to produce extremely high, prolonged serum 17β-estradiol concentrations in rodents. however, in the systematic analysis, separate analyses handled one variable at a time, and thus confounders were not controlled for. the discussion regarding what factors contribute to the estrogen-stroke dichotomy has nevertheless proceeded, and for example in a recent review, sohrabji et al. suggested that the factors age, hypertension, rat strain and whether the middle cerebral artery occlusion was permanent or not could explain why some articles report enlarged infarcts from estrogen administration. the fact that slow-release pellets had been used in all cited studies in which estrogens had increased damage was not even mentioned. the statistical shortcomings of the previous systematic analysis, the continuing debate on the matter and the publication of several additional original studies since the previous systematic analysis encouraged us to perform an updated and improved meta-analysis, where all methodological differences that reasonably could affect the impact of estrogens on experimental ischemic stroke would be controlled for in a large multiple regression model. the current meta-analysis therefore aimed to address the hypotheses that estrogen administration mode, the age of the experimental animals and the length of hypoestrogenicity affects estrogens’ impact on stroke.  slow release pellets render estrogens significantly less protective/more damaging sixty-one studies, describing pairs of estrogen-treated groups and control groups of rats in which focal cerebral ischemia was induced, were included, and data regarding methodology and results was extracted for meta-analysis. in the final multiple regression model, with correction for all included confounding factors, the effects of estrogens on focal cerebral ischemia was clearly affected by the mode of estrogen administration. slow-release pellets rendered estrogens significantly more damaging/less protective than if the estrogens were administered via injections or silastic capsules. the use of direct, mechanical mcao procedures, laser-doppler flowmetry surveillance, edema correction and the variable length of time between initiation of estrogen administration and induction of the ischemic damage were also found to significantly influence the impact of estrogens on focal cerebral ischemia. notably, concerning the abovementioned hypotheses b and c, the factors elderly rats and washout were excluded in the preceding backward analysis due to too low impact on the outcome variable infarct size ratio between estrogen treated and control rats. variables excluded in preceding multiple regression analysis due to too low explanatory value: strain, sex, elderly rats, washout, occlusion duration, length of time between ischemia and evaluation of damage. the final multiple regression model included group pairs, and yielded an r2-value of, hence explaining % of the variation in ec-ratio. higher dose in slow-release pellets increases the risk of estrogen exacerbating ischemic damage simple linear regression analyses including only group pairs within one specific estrogen administration mode category were run with dose as the independent factor and ec-ratio as the outcome variable. there was a significant, positive relation between slow-release pellet dose and ec-ratio, meaning that increasing the pellet dose increased the likeliness that estrogens would be damaging. this model had an r2-value of, indicating that it explained 26% of the ec-ratio variation. adding the factor elderly rats to the model did not affect the r2-value, and there was not even a slight tendency for increased damage in elderly rats. a similar analysis to address hypothesis c could not be done since only one single study administered estrogen via pellets more than 14 days after ovariectomy. for the group pairs administered estrogens via injection or silastic capsules, there were no significant relations between dosage and ec-ratio, however the trend in both models was that increased estrogen dose increased neuroprotection. descriptive statistics the frequencies of categories in the included group pairs are depicted in figure  two variables, diseases and estrogen type, were excluded from the statistical analyses because too few group pairs deviated from the dominant category. descriptive statistics for the continuous variables are presented in table  discussion the main multiple regression model, controlling for all listed confounders, revealed an indisputable impact of estrogen administration mode on the effects of estrogens in ischemic stroke. slow-release pellets significantly differed from the injection and silastic capsule treatments in terms of resulting ec-ratio, showing that slow-release pellets are more prone to render estrogens damaging. of note, the slow-release pellet confidence interval extended over the 100% ec-ratio line, underscoring the potential for harm as well as benefit. in an attempt to further shed light on this finding, administration mode-specific simple regression models between dose and ec-ratio were run. while no statistically significant relation was seen between dose and ec-ratio in the injection and silastic capsule group pairs, higher slow-release pellet dose was clearly related to increased ischemic damage. a plausible explanation for the tendency of estrogens in slow-release pellets to be less protective/more damaging is that this high-dose administration mode causes extremely high, elevated serum 17β-estradiol concentrations. it has repeatedly been shown that the pellets from innovative research of america®, albeit with a large portion of unpredictability, render prolonged serum concentrations that are well beyond the physiological spectrum. silastic capsules produce serum concentrations in a much lower, often physiological, range, while daily injections result in hours-long spikes followed by estrogen-deficient intervals, rendering the 24 h-average serum concentrations low. the finding that higher pellet dose increased the detrimental tendency is well in line with the hypothesis that the administered dose is the culprit. such an explanation is reflected in the concept of hormesis, stating that dose–response curves are not always unidirectional, but that a substance can have diametrically different effects in different concentration ranges. the current meta-analysis strongly suggests that low-dose estrogen therapy is protective in rat models of focal cerebral ischemia, while high-dose estrogen therapy is more likely to be detrimental. recently, a study aiming to experimentally test this hypothesis was published in bmc neuroscience. the main finding was that true hormesis, with bidirectional effects in different dose ranges compared to baseline, could be demonstrated in the in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation experiments. when different doses of 17β-estradiol in analogy were tested on rats, higher doses rendered less protection than low doses. while there is a multitude of narrative reviews covering the field of animal models of stroke and estrogens, to the best of our knowledge only one systematic review, except for the article from our lab referred to in the background, has been published. the main finding presented in that article was that estrogens seemed to reduce ischemic damage in a positive dose-dependent manner, a result that could not be corroborated by the current review. the previous review differed fundamentally from the current meta-analysis by not analyzing differences between studies reporting neuroprotection versus studies reporting increased damage from estrogens. regarding hypothesis b, no impact of the use of elderly animals on estrogens’ effects in stroke was seen. in the preceding backward multiple regression analysis, the variable was the first one to be excluded, without even a trace of higher ec-ratio in elderly rats. if anything, the regression coefficient suggested more estrogenic protection in elderly animals, in contrary to hypothesis b. similarly for hypothesis c, the second variable to be excluded in the backward analysis was the wash-out category >14 days. in analogy with the use of elderly rats, the regression coefficient pointed in the negative direction, negating hypothesis c by indicating more protection from estrogen after longer hypoestrogenic intervals. it however deserves mention that since elderly rats or wash-out periods beyond 2 weeks were used in a low number of studies, conclusions about these variables should be drawn with caution. although no support for hypotheses b and c was found in the present analysis, researchers have previously suggested mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high age and long periods of hypoestrogenicity. for example in an article published selvamani et al. put forward that decreasing igf- levels in elderly rats and further suppression by estrogen treatment is associated with a decline in estrogens’ beneficial effects in the aging brain. regarding the potential harm of a prolonged wash-out period, suzuki et al. proposed loss of anti-inflammatory actions of estrogens as a possible mechanism. a few other variables were found to significantly affect the ec-ratio, however since these did not address the main hypotheses, we refrain from drawing conclusions about them, and refer to table  for the interested reader. strengths and weaknesses an inherent draw-back with linear regression analysis is that linear relations are assumed, which evidently is not always true. this imperfection must be kept in mind when assessing the results. another weakness of the current study is that the group pairs were described in only articles, which in turn were published by even fewer research groups. to be perfectly stringent, group pairs from the same article or the same research group should not be regarded as independent. however, creating dummy variables for each article or research group would have made the analysis totally devoid of statistical power, and thus impossible to perform. the analysis presents a composite result of data gathered from group pairs and more than rats, handled in a rich variety of experimental conditions. the main strength of the current meta-analysis is that all factors that have been suggested to be responsible for the discrepant results were tested in parallel, thus potently correcting for confounders.  we conclude that the discordant results regarding estrogens’ effects in rat models of ischemic stroke are a consequence of differences in estrogen administration modes, corroborating the earlier systematic analysis from our laboratory. the clearly protective effects of silastic capsules and injections contrast the potentially harmful effects of estrogens delivered via the high-dose slow-release pellets. further, the relation between higher pellet doses and increased propensity for causing damage underscores the plausibility that delivered dose is the culprit, which is reflected in the concept of hormesis. the meta-analysis could not corroborate the hypotheses that the age of the experimental animals nor the length of hypoestrogenicity affected estrogens’ impact on stroke. "," although most animal stroke studies have demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects of estrogens, there are a number of articles reporting the opposite. in we made the case that this dichotomy was related to administered estrogen dose. several other suggestions for the discordant results have also been propagated, including the age of the experimental animals and the length of hypoestrogenicity prior to estrogen administration. these two suggestions have gained much popularity, probably because of their kinship with the window of opportunity hypothesis, which is commonly used to explain the analogous dichotomy among human studies. we were therefore encouraged to perform an updated meta-analysis, and to improve it by including all relevant variables in a large multiple regression model, where the impact of confounders could be controlled for.  the multiple regression model revealed an indisputable impact of estrogen administration mode on the effects of estrogens in ischemic stroke. subcutaneous slow-release pellets differed from the injection and silastic capsule treatments in terms of impact of estrogens on ischemic stroke, showing that the first mentioned were more prone to render estrogens damaging. neither the use of elderly animals nor the adoption of longer wash-out periods influenced estrogens’ effects on experimental ischemic stroke in rats.  we conclude that the discordant results regarding estrogens’ effects in rat models of ischemic stroke are a consequence of differences in estrogen administration modes. these results are not only of importance for the ongoing debate regarding menopausal hormone therapy, but also have an important bearing on experimental stroke methodology and the apparent translational roadblock for suggested stroke interventions. cerebral ischemiaestradiolestrogensmeta-analysisratsstroke ",6b61320b-f139-459f-867b-0ed5da6a0834,pubmed
199," specific allergen immunotherapy is recommended for persistent allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma resistant to pharmacotherapy, and is the only disease-modifying treatment in that benefit persists after stopping treatment. however, subcutaneous injection of immunotherapy extracts carries a risk of anaphylaxis, whilst sublingual therapy requires daily treatment over three years. one approach to reducing the risk of anaphylaxis with scit is to modify allergen extracts to reduce ige binding. such allergoids include extracts treated with acid, prior to polymerisation with glutaraldehyde. these extracts showed efficacy in clinical trials for both birch and grass pollen-related allergic rhinitis, and house dust mite-related asthma. in these studies and large observational series, side effects were minimal. the resulting depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts are of very large molecular mass, and have at least times reduced ige binding in vitro in competition assays and in vivo in skin prick testing. analysis of sequences obtained by enzymatic digestion of depig-pol and native extracts suggests conservation of major allergen sequences for both dust mite and pollen extracts, and in vivo immunogenicity studies show induction of igg directed against the majority of major allergens upon treatment of patients with these extracts and in studies involving immunization of experimental animals. whilst allergoids have reduced ige binding which may improve safety, it has also been suggested that they have reduced t cell stimulating activity which could compromise efficacy. studies of t cell activity of allergoids in terms of proliferation of primary t cells, lines or clones, have suggested variable degrees of loss of ability to stimulate t cells, either generally or restricted to some epitopes. however, the immunological efficacy of sit most likely relates to induction of tolerance to allergens through interactions with regulatory t cells. studies with unmodified allergen extracts suggest increased numbers and activity of both cd4+cd25hifoxp3hi t cells and il- producing t cells after sit treatment, together with induction of the il-10-dependent antibody igg. thus expansion of tregs may be a more relevant activity to assess for allergen extracts for sit. in order to improve efficacy, reduce dosing and improve safety of allergen immunotherapy a number of adjuvants have been examined. in particular, there is much current interest in 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d which can expand both induced il-10-producing and foxp3+ treg in vitro, and improved effects of immunotherapy in animal models. vitamin d status and/or treatment of human volunteers with vitamin d derivatives correlated with or increased foxp3+ t cell frequency in the periphery and the airway in asthmatics and il- producing treg in the periphery. here we have examined the relative stimulation of effector and regulatory t cells in vitro by unmodified and depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts, together with the effects of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d  depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts stimulate less t cell proliferation than native extracts, but similar cytokine production production of depigmented-polymerised extracts involves two steps which might alter t cell reactivity. therefore initial timecourse and dose-response experiments were performed to assess proliferation of pbmc from atopic donors in cultures stimulated with native, depigmented and depigmented-polymerised house dust mite and grass pollen extracts. maximal proliferation was seen at day for all extracts except for depig-pol hdm extract which was highest at day. note that pbmc viability was comparable between hdm native and depig-pol stimulated cultures, % and %, respectively. data for some of the experiments with grass pollen extracts has been presented elsewhere. dermatophagoides pteronyssinus phleum pratense donor clinical characteristics are shown in brackets, specific ige concentration and cap class for each allergen, and size of skin prick test weal in mm. note equal proportions of male and female subjects were studied. mean of allergic patients was 38 years old; mean age of nonatopic individuals was 40 years old. proliferation for depigmented hdm and grass extracts was very similar to that seen for native extracts, but proliferation was signficantly less for depig-pol extracts of both hdm and grass when compared to native unmodified extracts. for this reason, further comparisons were between native and depig-pol extracts. cytokine production was also maximal at day seven for all cytokines except il- which peaked at day. seven days of culture was therefore used for further comparisons. production of il- il- and il- did not differ significantly between cultures stimulated with native or depigmented-polymerised extracts of either hdm or grass, whilst there was a non-significant trend for reduced ifnγ and significantly reduced il- in depig-pol-stimulated cultures compared to native extract. depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts expand regulatory t cells more than effector t cells in culture to examine effects of native and depigmented-polymerised extracts in stimulation of regulatory or effector cells we examined expression of cd foxp and cd after 7 days of culture of pbmc. gating strategy was as described, to identify cells that we have previously shown to be regulatory in cultures. for both hdm and grass, depig-pol extracts expanded similar numbers of cd4+cd25+foxp3hicd127lo compared to native extracts, but reduced numbers of cd4+cd25+foxp3locd127+. when expressed as a ratio of cd25+foxp3hi cd127lo to cd25+foxp3locd127+ cells this was significantly higher for depig-pol extracts of both hdm and grass when compared to cultures stimulated with native extracts. addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d to cultures further favours cd25hifoxp3hicd127lo t cells addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d at 10-7 m further reduced expansion of effector cells in cultures stimulated with both native and depig-pol extracts of hdm and grass, whilst numbers of cd4+cd25+foxp3hicd127lo regulatory cells were not reduced. thus the ratio of regulatory to effector cells after cultures was further increased by addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d. in addition 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d reduced effector cytokines, particularly il- and ifnγ, but did not significantly affect il- production. discussion these data suggest reduced proliferation and cytokine production by pbmc from atopic donors stimulated with depig-pol extracts compared to native, unmodified allergen extracts for grass pollen and house dust mite. however, depig-pol allergen extracts for grass pollen and hdm favoured expansion of regulatory t cells over effector t cells in vitro, and this balance was further tilted towards regulation by 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d thus depig-pol allergen extracts may favour regulatory t cells over effector t cell activation, which might be expected to augment tolerance induction in sit. several reports have previously examined t cell responses to allergoids. all showed reduced proliferation of pbmcs stimulated with allergoid when compared to native allergen, and variable reductions in cytokine production. this difference in t cell proliferation between allergoid and native extract was suggested to vary with antigen presenting cell type, although this was not confirmed in a subsequent study. analysis of responses of t cell lines and clones suggested variable loss of t cell epitopes in allergoid extracts compared to native extracts. our data also suggests reduced proliferation and effector cytokine production by pbmc stimulated by depig-pol extracts compared with native extract, and these findings were confirmed by reduced expansion of cells with effector phenotype in depig-pol stimulated cultures. we would argue that reduced activation and expansion of effector t cells by depig-pol extracts will actually be beneficial in the context of sit, where effector t cell activation may contribute to side effects. this is demonstrated most graphically for peptide therapy where small allergen peptides which did not cross link ige nonetheless activated effector t cells and lead to isolated late asthmatic reactions in patients. we did not examine loss of t cell epitopes comparing depig-pol extracts with native extracts, although previous mass spectroscopic analysis has suggested preservation of most major allergen sequences. even if some t cell epitopes were lost during the depigmentation and polymerisation process, we would argue that the critical activity for tolerance induction is expansion of regulatory t cells that work in both antigen-specific and non-antigen specific fashion, as shown by linked suppression to cat major allergen fel d peptides not included in the experimental peptide immunotherapy treatment in an animal model. although depig-pol extracts stimulated reduced effector t cell expansion and activation compared to native extracts, numbers of regulatory t cells were similar, so the ratio of regulatory to effector t cells in cultures stimulated with depig-pol extracts was significantly higher than for native extract. activation requirements for effector versus regulatory t cells are incompletely understood, but we would suggest that antigen-presenting cell processing of and activation by these molecules of vastly different mass may be relevant in the case of depig-pol versus native extracts. interestingly, our data both here and in previous studies suggest that depigmented-polymerised extracts and 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d both favour foxp3hi t cells. initial reports suggested that 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d acted to expand il- producing t cells. however, our recent data shows that 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d can also expand foxp3hi tregs. the type of treg emerging depended on the concentration of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d in cultures, and the cytokine milieu and essentially no co-expression of foxp and il- was observed, although both populations exhibited comparable suppressive activity. the present findings are in keeping with that data in that a relatively higher concentration favoured foxp3hi tregs, and in these conditions il- producing t cells were not detected. our previous report suggested that the major effect of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d was to suppress proliferation of effector t cells and maintain foxp expression by regulatory t cells: our current data agrees with this, as we show reduced effector t cells and cytokines, and a preserved foxp3hi treg population. sit with depigmented-polymerised extracts, which have at least 95% reduced ige binding compared to native allergen extract, has been shown to be clinically effective in reducing symptom scores for rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma with minimal side effects and rapid up-dosing. further studies are required to examine the effects of depig-pol extracts on tregs in vivo, and to determine whether 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d can enhance tolerance in a clinical setting of sit.  depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts appear to favour treg expansion over activation of effector t cells to a greater extent than unmodified allergen extracts. 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d further reduces effector t cell activation by both allergen extracts, and may be a useful adjuvant for sit. "," allergen immunotherapy is the only treatment for allergic disease capable of modifying disease long term. to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis from sit, allergen-extracts have been modified by polymerisation with glutaraldehyde to reduce ige binding. it is suggested that these allergoid extracts also have reduced t cell activity, which could compromise clinical efficacy. effective sit is thought to act through regulatory t cells rather than activation of effector t cells. there is no published data on the activity of modified extracts on tregs.  we compared the capacity of modified versus unmodified allergen extracts of grass pollen and house dust mite to stimulate proliferation/cytokine production and to modulate treg/effector t cell frequency in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from volunteers sensitised to both allergens in vitro. depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts stimulated less proliferation of pbmc, and reduced effector cell numbers after 7 days in culture than did native extracts. however, the frequency of foxp3+ tregs in cultures were similar to those seen with native extract so that ratios of regulatory to effector t cells were significantly increased in cultures stimulated with depigmented-polymerised extracts. addition of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d further favoured treg, and reduced effector cytokine production, but not interleukin-  depigmented-polymerised allergen extracts appear to favour treg expansion over activation of effector t cells and this may relate to their demonstrated efficacy and safety in sit. 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin d further reduces effector t cell activation by allergen extracts and may be a useful adjuvant for sit. allergen extractdepigmented-polymerisedimmunotherapyregulatory t cellvitamin d ",7a19e95b-492f-4ddd-ae0a-6c703f6e33d6,pubmed
200," glucosidase inhibitors are responsible for disruption of the activity of glucosidase, an enzyme that cleaves the glycosidic bond. these inhibitors have played a vital role in revealing the functions of glucosidases in living system by modifying or blocking specific metabolic processes; and, this revelation led to several applications of these chemical entities in agriculture and medicine. the quest for new glucosidase inhibitors is crucially important owing to their therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetes, human immuno deficiency virus infection, metastatic cancer, lysosomal storage disease etc.. microorganisms, particularly marine microorganisms, have an unparalleled distinction of producing valuable compounds. so, screening microbial culture extracts for uncovering novel structures that can inhibit glucosidases, is of immense interest. there are extremely few reports of glucosidase inhibitors, particularly β-glucosidase inhibitors from microorganisms, possibly because of lack of efficient high throughput methods to detect the presence of β-glucosidase inhibitors in microbial culture extracts. the most commonly employed method involves p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as substrate in either microplate screening test or tlc autographic method. in this method, glucosidase activity is measured indirectly, in a colorimetric assay by visual or spectrophotometric assessment of the nitrophenyl chromophore released from pnpg in the absence of inhibitor. the yellow colouration developed using this glucopyranoside in a glucosidase positive reaction, is too faint and not in contrast with its surrounding for clear visual distinction in tlc plate or otherwise. microwell plate methods are rapid, but many factors such as protease in fermentation broths, microbial contamination of extracts, biological pigments, or salts in crude extracts can interfere with the readings. the tlc autographic method - using esculin as substrate - by salazar and furlan was the most convincing method as an alternative to the methods using pnpg. in this tlc autographic method, the enzyme β-glucosidase is immobilized by gel entrapment in agar and tlc autography is performed. the enzyme activity is tested on esculin as substrate which splits into esculetin and glucose; the released esculetin reacts with fecl to form a blackish brown precipitate. inhibition of this activity is observed as a pale yellowish zone around the spot of the positive samples. many of the previous studies have used tlc autographic method, which may not be suitable for high throughput screening as they are more laborious and time consuming. moreover, uniform separation of compounds in all extracts cannot be achieved with single solvent system; hence spotting all the extracts on one tlc plate to rapidly perform the assay would be frustrating. for screening a large number of natural extracts, tlc autography was performed without developing the plate so that activities resulting from synergistic action of multiple components of extracts are detected. in this context, we consider the use of tlc plate to be unnecessary; more so because the zone of inhibition on white tlc plate background was not very clear and hence there are chances of losing some promising natural extracts. in a nutshell, accurate assessment of glucosidase inhibition activity in several extracts at a time is difficult by these conventional methods. thus, we developed a novel method by pouring the enzyme-agar solution in a thin layer on a petri dish and spot inoculating the samples on the agar surface, for achieving clear detection of β-glucosidase inhibitors in microbial culture extracts.  the microbial culture extracts, which were positive for β-glucosidase inhibitors, showed as pale yellowish zone of inhibition at places where the samples were spotted while the rest of the plate turned blackish brown due to the reaction of esculetin and ferric ion. a large number of methanol extracts of microorganisms were screened using the new method, and we found extracts contain inhibitors out of extracts tested. as compared to the earlier reports of screening plant and microbial extracts, this method could detect greater number of positive extracts, which may be, because of the easily discernible results. this method is also rapid as it takes about 1 hr to test samples in a Ø90 mm petri plate. the throughput can be increased by increasing petri plate size or using a multiple of plates. the present agar plate based method evolved from the protocol described by salazar and furlan, since we encountered some difficulty while screening the microbial extracts. the enzyme-agar solution did not evenly spread on the tlc plate, and the brown colour on white plate background was not uniform throughout the tlc plate; thus it was difficult to observe the inhibition activity as clear spots in contrast to the surrounding. although zones were visible, it was difficult to ascertain certain samples as positive or negative. hence we modified the method, and used petri plates to set in the enzyme-agar solution and spot inoculated the samples on the enzyme-agar plate and dried the samples using a blow-dryer. then the plate was flooded with substrate solution. the results were visually clear in this agar plate method when compared side by side with tlc autography. we tested a subset of samples with salazar’s method described in and, as well as with the new method. all of the samples were inactive when the tlc plate was developed indicating synergistic interaction among the sample components was responsible for the positive activity. out of the extracts tested were observed to be positive on the undeveloped tlc plate whereas, showed β-glucosidase inhibition activity on the agar plate method. however, the quality of zone in some samples was not clear in tlc autographic method as shown in figure  conduritol β-epoxide - an active site-directed covalent inhibitor - was tested in a dose dependent order to confirm the effectiveness of this method and the results are presented. the minimum detection limit of conduritol β-epoxide in the new method, when samples were spot inoculated on the agar surface, is  μg. although salazar and furlan reported the detection limit to be  μg in tlc autographic method, we observed similar results with conduritol in both the methods. however, the clarity of zones is undoubtedly better in the agar plate method as seen in figure 3a and 3b. we also tested imidazole derivatives, 1--imidazole and 2-aminobenzimidazole, as reversible inhibitors of β-glucosidase with this method. figure  demonstrates the inhibition activity of 1--imidazole in a dose dependent order up to 50 μg. the detection limit of 2-aminobenzimidazole was 100 μg. as compared to conduritol, imidazole derivatives are less potent inhibitors of β-glucosidase. comparing the new method with the protocol of salazar and furlan, we achieved reliable results in lesser time. the enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate reaction time of 2 hrs was not necessary. the enzyme-inhibitor incubation of 15 min was sufficient as the samples were blow dried. similarly, after pouring the esculin solution the zones could be seen within 10–15 min, which off course becomes clear as the time progresses, but within 30 min, the contrast of zones is completely clear.  the new method can be used in conjunction with tlc autography. with agar plate method, several extracts could be quickly screened for activity and then the compound responsible for β-glucosidase inhibition in positive extracts could be located with the tlc autographic method. the present method is rapid and effective; hence it is suitable for initial screening. the contrast in inhibition zones is quite prominent as compared to other methods described so far for β-glucosidase inhibition. the sensitivity of this method is same or better than the tlc autographic method. it is very simple and convenient to perform. "," few beta-glucosidase inhibitors have so far been reported from microorganisms due to the practical difficulties in performing the inhibition tests and subsequent interpretation of results. in an effort to investigate marine microbial extracts for β-glucosidase inhibitors, we developed a new protocol, using esculin as substrate in an agar plate based assay, to screen a large number of microbial extracts in a short span of time.  with the new method, pale yellowish zones against the blackish brown background could be visually observed with more clarity in sample extracts where β-glucosidase inhibitor was present. the new method was compared with the closest existing method and established beyond doubt. this agar plate based procedure required about one hour for minimum samples and the throughput increases with the size of the agar gel plate used.  the new protocol was simple, rapid and effective in detecting beta-glucosidase inhibitors in microbial extracts. glucosidase inhibitoresculinconduritol β-epoxidemicrobial extractsmarine microorganismsanti-diabeticsanti-obesityanti-hiv ",1dfd390b-80e3-4abf-9c66-68c87cc84a86,pubmed
201," visualization of sequence annotation is a common feature in many bioinformatics tools. for example, the widely used ucsc genome browser and ensembl web sites, and also standalone programs such as artemis or the integrated genome browser graphically display genetic features in their genomic context. these tools also provide means to import additional user-defined numerical annotation, e.g., for the display of experimental data along the genome. these data are then displayed either as continuous line or bar graphs along the sequence, or as boxes covering a sequence range coloured according to the numerical data, i.e., a scored annotation. a better understanding of a data set can often be achieved when its complexity can be reduced. while all of the aforementioned frameworks are suited to display user-defined data in its entirety, they do not allow for convenient and dynamic customisation of the graphics on-the-fly. the genome browsers are similar to other previously published tools for visualising annotation, such as gff2ps, in that they produce ""static"" output as either a web page or a postscript file. the artemis and integrated genome browser programs have their strength in presenting gene annotation or tiling array data, but are not easily customisable for display of other data types such as position weight matrix matches. implementation here, we present biosave, a graphical mac os x application for visualisation of scored annotation in a sequence context. it is written in objective c and makes use of os x-specific system libraries for responsive display of annotation changes. a plug-in interface allows to invoke external scripts upon loading an annotation file, which is useful for converting external formats into gff  biosave will read sequence data in fasta format or raw text, annotation scores from gff files or, using a plug-in interface, any other parse-able file format that contains coordinates and scores for an annotation. only data with scores that lie within a user-specified score range will then be displayed along the sequence. adjusting the score thresholds will dynamically change which annotations are visible, and at which colour level. where other tools only support a fixed score range, this range automatically adjusts to the data present in the user's input. in addition to the dynamic view, biosave can display additional tracks along the sequence comprising a conventional bar graph visualisation. the sequence view itself can be adjusted and allows for continuous zooming from the entire sequence down to the nucleotide level. in our hands, on a ghz powerpc g with gb of ram, biosave can reliably handle up to mb of sequence along with about microarray data points for numerical annotation. the versatility of biosave extends to the display of annotation scores also in protein sequences. only a small number of tools for handling protein sequence allow to load and display additional numerical annotation. however, these programs are comparable to the static display of artemis and the integrated genome browser, and do not allow for the on-the-fly customisation found in biosave. in the following section, we discuss two applications in which biosave could be used in day-to-day research. usage example: transcription factor binding site matches in a dna sequence the binding specificity of a transcription factor or other dna-binding protein is often represented as position weight matrix, which allows for a numerical description of the binding site rather than a fixed search string. many theoretical frameworks and bioinformatic tools exists to identify nucleotide sequences that are matched by a pwm, e.g., patser, clover and motifscanner. while these programs are powerful in the identification of pwm matches to a sequence, they all lack an immediate and intuitive display of the results, which is key to make useful biological interpretations. the difficulty in the interpretation of pwm matches to a sequence is often the lack of a score threshold that reliably distinguishes biologically relevant matches from closely related hits in the sequence. thus, it is desirable to display the identified pwm matches at various score cutoffs. this helps to establish a cutoff at which the pwm match is convincing, both in terms of its similarity with the sequence, and, if known, whether biologically relevant sequences are being recognised. for patser and clover, the web interfaces rsa-tools and motifviz are available to visualize pwm matches in input sequences, thus making the results accessible to the bench biologist. however, by default, these interfaces display every possible match to the pwm and lack the ability to dynamically adjust score thresholds. a common problem in the interpretation of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments is to precisely identify the tf binding site from a much larger region showing chip enrichment for the factor. in figure a portion of the adh region in the d. melanogaster genome and the results of a chip experiment for the suppressor of hairy wing ) protein are being shown. biosave shows a clear correlation between chip enrichment along a kb tiling path and the strength of su pwm matches. at the nucleotide level, focussing on the cyclin e gene within the adh region, a validated binding site is shown alongside phastcon scores, which further characterise it in terms of evolutionary conservation. usage example: structural hidden markov model matches in a protein sequence functional annotation of proteins includes the assignment of structural domains. a common strategy is to identify regions of homology to functionally characterised domains. this is often achieved by searching the protein sequence with hidden markov models from databases such as superfamily and pfam. figure shows the structural annotation of the su protein, along with data of putative phosphorylation sites from the netphos server and the degree of sequence identity seen amongst six closely related drosophila species. it can be observed that phosphorylation sites are relatively sparse within the predicted zinc finger domains, which are evolutionary highly conserved in this protein.  biosave is a highly focused, easy-to-use tool for viewing scored annotation in a sequence context. it has many advantages over other sequence annotation visualisation systems not specifically designed for this task. for example, the aforementioned web interfaces do not allow for prompt user interaction, and other tools developed primarily for visualisation of microarray data are too inflexible to handle scored annotation of different types or sources appropriately, e.g., quick highlighting of matches to a particular pwm etc. to our knowledge, biosave is the only tool for annotation visualisation that handles dna and protein sequences alike. this paper describes several applications in which biosave is used in our day-to-day research. through its support of standard sequence and annotation formats, as well as the versatile plug-in system, biosave can be used in a wide range of applications not specifically discussed here. for example, it can be used for display of mutation hotspots in dna or protein sequences or display of predicted interaction surfaces along a protein sequence. availability and

"," visualization of sequence annotation is a common feature in many bioinformatics tools. for many applications it is desirable to restrict the display of such annotation according to a score cutoff, as biological interpretation can be difficult in the presence of the entire data. unfortunately, many visualisation solutions are somewhat static in the way they handle such score cutoffs.  we present biosave, a sequence annotation viewer with on-the-fly selection of visualisation thresholds for each feature. biosave is a versatile os x program for visual display of scored features within a sequence context. the program reads sequence and additional supplementary annotation data from a variety of commonly used file formats and displays them graphically. onscreen controls then allow for live customisation of these graphics, including on-the-fly selection of visualisation thresholds for each feature.  possible applications of the program include display of transcription factor binding sites in a genomic context or the visualisation of structural domain assignments in protein sequences and many more. the dynamic visualisation of these annotations is useful, e.g., for the determination of cutoff values of predicted features to match experimental data. program, source code and exemplary files are freely available at the biosave homepage.

202," human faces provide key social and emotional information via the expressions portrayed. in a single encounter, an individual's facial expressions change rapidly, requiring a quick deduction of meaning. this ability to process facial expressions quickly or automatically is particularly advantageous when the expressions predict threat. given the importance of processing social threat cues in facial expressions quickly, the meaning may be conveyed by several key features. schematic faces, simple line drawings or caricatures of faces, extract these features from a complex facial expression. a schematic face capturing the key components of a facial expression may be useful in studies of emotion because the prototype is relatively devoid of confounding characteristics. several studies have discovered that schematic faces still retain emotional meaning and schematic faces activate brain structures involved in processing human facial expressions, providing evidence that a simple representation of a facial expression can be used to study emotion. it is well-established that the amygdala response habituates to repeated presentations of human facial expressions; however, it is unclear whether the brain's response to schematic faces is maintained or habituates over time. amygdala single cell recordings show reduced activity to repeated human faces. additionally, neuroimaging studies have reported early vs. late within-block habituation in the amygdala and hippocampal formation in response to repeated fearful and neutral human faces. to our knowledge, only two studies have reported on habituation effects in response to schematic faces. in an event-related study involving both human and schematic faces, significant amygdala habituation was reported to schematic faces of anger relative to neutral in individuals with social phobia. in a block-design study of healthy individuals, the amgydala response to schematic faces was maintained across time; however, the presentation order may have inhibited habituation. in this fmri block-design study, we examined the brain responses to schematic and human facial expressions using a within-run facial expression and between-run face type counterbalanced design. this design allowed examination of habituation and of face type in a single experiment without potentially confounding influences of presentation order. we hypothesized within-run habituation effects would be detected in response to the alternating blocks of schematic facial expressions as well as the human facial expressions in the amygdala.  face recognition and emotion ratings during the post-scanning recognition task, participants identified the faces viewed with high accuracy rates. the negative faces were rated as being more arousing than the neutral faces. no differences in arousal ratings between face type were detected. no interaction effects were noted. the negative faces were rated as being more negative than the neutral faces. the human faces tended to be rated more negatively than the schematic faces. in addition, the valence rating difference between angry and neutral faces was greater for schematic faces than for human faces. this difference was due to greater negative valence ratings of the human neutral faces compared to more positive ratings of neutral schematic faces. bold activation a temporal effect of responses across blocks within the run were detected in amygdala and fusiform gyrus. a significant quadratic response was detected in both regions. post-hoc tests were conducted using a significance threshold of p < to correct for multiple comparisons and demonstrated a ""u"" pattern of activity. in the amygdala and fusiform, the response in the initial block was greater than the other blocks. contrary to the amygdala, the responses in the fusiform gyrus tend to progressively decline. in addition, a trend towards significant region x time interaction was detected in the left and the right hemispheres. responses to block were greater than block significantly in the right amygdala and bilateral fusiform gyrus and at trend-level significance in the left amygdala. in the right amygdala, a trend emotion x time effect was significant. because the initial block yielded the largest response and was subsequently followed by a habituated response, the responses in the first time block were investigated further for valence effects. greater responses were elicited to negative faces compared to neutral faces.. there were no other significant effects in the amygdala. no significant valence, face-type main effets or interactions were found in the fusiform gyrus.. discussion within each run, the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus showed a ""u"" response pattern with the initial and final blocks eliciting the greatest activation to a repeated facial expression. the amygdala profile may reflect an initial orienting response, then habituation, followed by recovery of activation in the final block. a similar ""u"" pattern was observed in skin conductance response and late-phase scr-associated left amygdala response to repeated fearful faces. like fear, anger is highly arousing and may prompt a similar orienting response and skin conductance response. the activation recovery may be due to emotional priming. alternatively, it may reflect spontaneous recovery or reinstatement. vigilance maintenance via a system reset, even in the absence of imminent threat, may be an important survival function. consistent with this notion, primate electrophysiological data demonstrate that neuronal populations within the amygdala respond maximally to novelty, show decreased activation with familiarity, and reset after limited number of repeated stimulus presentations. in this study, fusiform gyrus activation followed this ""u"" pattern in response as well; however, a trend towards different temporal patterns are observed in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus. in the amygdala, habituation occurs rapidly; whereas, in the fusiform gyrus, habituation occurs more gradually. this delayed recovery may be explained by enhanced modulation of the amygdala or a slower resetting system of the fusiform gyrus. negative faces are discriminated from neutral faces in the right amygdala. our findings replicate previous work showing that the right amygdala, responds to angry relative to neutral faces. in this study, the differential amygdala response to facial expressions was present only during the early time period, suggesting that it is related to the amygdala orienting response. although some studies report fusiform gyrus activation to emotional faces relative to neutral faces, we did not detect such an effect. it may be that differential fusiform gyrus activation to emotional faces is task-dependent. the fusiform gyrus responds more non-selectively to facial stimuli in the context of limited-attentional demands, yet exhibits a selective or differential pattern of activation when increased attention to face emotional content is required. in fact, the existence of projections from the amygdala to the fusiform cortex suggest that the amygdala may modulate the sensory processing stream according to the salience of the target visual stimulus. interestingly, no significant differences between schematic and human faces were detected in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus. in a recent study, the amygdala response to human and avatar was similar, yet the fusiform showed a greater response to human faces. for studying the amygdala, it appears that there is some utility to this response similarity between human and face representations. schematic and avatar faces may be useful to study emotion perception because the key facial features that underlie the neural activation are relatively isolated from stimulus features like race/ethnicity and gender, which may increase the variability in responses. it is also important to note that schematic and avatar faces may be useful in answering different questions concerning emotion that take advantage of the static or moveable representations. this study has some potential limitations. evaluating the temporal dynamics of neural responses is dependent on the time scale examined. in this study, within-run habituation effects were investigated; however, other time scales may show different effects. only angry faces were used to represent negative faces. future studies should examine the temporal dynamics of other expressions, including positive expressions. our findings suggest schematic and human faces elicit generally similar responses in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus; however, replication in a larger sample is needed. schematic faces reduce expressions to line drawings and a single exemplar was used in this study. while using a single exemplar may be problematic, it does diminish confounds due to variability in human facial expressions. finally, although using roi-based analysis is a more powerful approach for detecting differences in specific a priori regions, this approach does not allow the observation of other regions that may also respond to these stimuli.  in summary, it appears that both the amygdala and fusiform gyrus responses to facial expressions do habituate over time; however, the ""u"" pattern suggests that the responsivity of these structures resets, possibly to allow attentional reengagement with repeatedly presented stimuli. future studies with larger samples should investigate whether this pattern discriminates between emotions or stimulus type. "," the amygdala habituates in response to repeated human facial expressions; however, it is unclear whether this brain region habituates to schematic faces. using an fmri block design, healthy participants passively viewed repeated presentations of schematic and human neutral and negative facial expressions. percent signal changes within anatomic regions-of-interest were calculated to examine the temporal dynamics of neural response and any response differences based on face type.  the amygdala and fusiform gyrus had a within-run ""u"" response pattern of activity to facial expression blocks. the initial block within each run elicited the greatest activation and the final block elicited greater activation than the preceding block. no significant differences between schematic and human faces were detected in the amygdala or fusiform gyrus.  the ""u"" pattern of response in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus to facial expressions suggests an initial orienting, habituation, and activation recovery in these regions. furthermore, this study is the first to directly compare brain responses to schematic and human facial expressions, and the similarity in brain responses suggest that schematic faces may be useful in studying amygdala activation.

203," the head of arthropods is a specialised anterior body region, which is distinguished by fused segments and several pairs of modified appendages. these appendages serve for swimming, feeding, defence, or sensory perception, and their movements are coordinated by a complex brain situated within the head. despite over a century of intense research in this area, the ancestral composition of the arthropod head remains obscure and is one of the most controversial topics in zoology. fossils have contributed much to our knowledge, but their limited preservation constrains definitive conclusions about the degree of cephalisation in the last common ancestor of panarthropoda. the extant onychophora are a key group when considering this issue, since they are close relatives of arthropods and resemble cambrian lobopodians, while their internal anatomy and embryology are accessible for detailed examination. as in various lobopodians, the onychophoran ""head"" is not clearly delineated from the trunk, but shows three pairs of modified appendages: sensory antennae, jaws situated within the mouth cavity, and slime papillae, which are used for defence and capturing prey organisms. these modified appendages have been assigned to each body segment by studying embryogenesis, which revealed that the antennae belong to the first body segment, the jaws to the second, and the slime papillae to the third segment. most importantly, these studies have provided no evidence of any additional vestigial cephalic segments in onychophora. this is supported by the expression data of segment polarity genes in onychophoran embryos, which show only three domains anterior to the leg-bearing segments, corresponding to the three cephalic segments. based on various studies of embryology, including the expression data of the anterior hox genes labial, proboscipedia, hox and deformed, the onychophoran ""head"" appendages can therefore be aligned with the corresponding appendages of arthropods. according to this alignment, the onychophoran antennae are either serial homologues of the arthropod labrum or, alternatively, the corresponding pair of appendages may have been lost in arthropods - an issue that is still controversial. since the onychophoran antennae belong to the anterior-most body segment bearing the eyes, they cannot be homologised with the chelicerae of chelicerates or the antennae of crustaceans, insects, and myriapods, which belong to the second body segment. the chelicerae and the antennae of arthropods are instead serially homologous to the onychophoran jaws. the onychophoran slime papillae are, in turn, serially homologous to the pedipalps of chelicerates and to the second antennae of crustaceans whereas the corresponding pair of appendages was lost in hexapods and myriapods. this alignment of head segments is reflected in the organisation of the central nervous system. three major brain regions are generally recognised in arthropods: the protocerebrum, the deutocerebrum, and the tritocerebrum, corresponding to the three anterior-most body segments. such an organisation has also been suggested for the onychophora, based on studies of adult brain anatomy and its neuropilar structure. however, an alternative view suggests that the onychophoran brain or ""cerebral ganglion"" is bipartite and does not include the region homologous to the arthropod tritocerebrum. one feature that has previously been used to determine the segmental organisation of the brain in onychophora is the position and number of transverse neuropils in the adult. three major neuropils have been identified, leading to the conclusion that the onychophoran brain is tripartite. however, this rests on the assumption that each neuropil arises from a separate segment during development - an issue, which has not been clarified thus far. an additional feature that could be used to identify the degree of segmentation of the onychophoran brain is the position of neuronal cell bodies innervating the head appendages. if the cell bodies of neurons innervating the tritocerebrum were found to lie within the brain, the hypothesis of tripartite organisation would be supported. in contrast, a position of these neuronal cell bodies found outside the brain would speak against the existence of the tritocerebrum in onychophora. to clarify the segmental composition of the onychophoran brain, we combined two approaches. first, we studied brain development to determine the embryonic origin of transverse neuropils. second, we analysed the position of neuronal cell bodies innervating the cephalic appendages. our results show that the major transverse neuropils of the onychophoran brain arise from only one body segment, and that only the antennae and jaws are innervated by the brain. these findings suggest that the onychophorans show a lower degree of cephalisation in relation to their brain organisation than the arthropods and that the tritocerebrum was not integrated into the brain in the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda.  the formation of onychophoran brain neuropils involves only one segment despite two recent and extensive studies of brain development in onychophora, the embryonic origin and segmental identities of transverse brain neuropils, other than the first commissure, remain unclear. strausfeld et al. subdivided the adult onychophoran brain into protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum by analysing series of histological and silver- and osmium-stained sections and assessing the number and spatial separation of brain neuropils. to clarify whether these brain neuropils have independent origins from different segments, we examined brain development in onychophoran embryos using an antibody raised against acetylated α-tubulin. this antibody labels mainly nerve tracts and neuropils in the developing nervous system. at an early stage, we detected only one transverse commissure in the anterior-most body segment. during development, this commissure forms the central neuropil, which subsequently gives rise to a second and a third neuropil. no other transverse neuropils appear posterior to the central neuropil later in development. thus, the three neuropils identified as proto-, deuto- and tritocerebrum in a previous study do not arise from three different segments. we suggest therefore that the position and physical separation of neuropils in the adult brain alone is an unreliable criterion for identifying its segmental organisation. thus, our immunolabelling experiments do not resolve the controversy of bipartite versus tripartite brain composition in onychophora. alternative approaches are required to decide between these two hypotheses. retrograde axonal tracing reveals that the tritocerebrum is absent from the onychophoran brain the position of neurons that project out the segmental nerves within the onychophoran head might be a key feature for determining the segmental identity of different brain regions. we therefore performed retrograde axonal tracing studies of segmental cephalic nerves in adult onychophorans, using dextran coupled to different fluorochromes as a tracer. we found that the cell bodies of neurons innervating the antennae lie within the brain, in the region corresponding to the arthropod protocerebrum. some of the filled axons of the antennal nerve terminate in glomerular structures, which have been described previously. the cell bodies innervating the jaws and the slime papillae lie adjacent to the base of their corresponding nerves: the jaw neurons are situated in the posterior-most region of the cerebral ganglion whereas those innervating the slime papillae lie in a more postero-ventral position within the nerve cord. our data show that the neurons innervating the slime papillae are located within the ventral nerve cord and, thus, outside the brain, the posterior border of which lies just posterior to the jaw nerves and anterior to the slime papillae nerves. this placement of the posterior brain border is consistent with all previous studies of the adult onychophoran brain anatomy. the neurons innervating the slime papillae cannot be considered part of the brain as the corresponding region of the central nervous system does not show any particular condensation of neurons or other morphological characteristics that would distinguish it from the medullary nerve cords. our backfill data reveal that only the cell bodies of neurons supplying the antennae and jaws lie within the brain whereas the region corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum belongs to the nerve cord. this finding contradicts previous assumptions of a tripartite brain in onychophora. the absence of the tritocerebrum from the onychophoran brain implies that the bipartite brain composition is an ancestral feature of onychophora. an alternative scenario proposing that the tritocerebrum might have become separated from the onychophoran brain secondarily is unlikely since one would have to assume opposite relocation events during the evolution of the onychophoran head: while the slime papillae have been incorporated into the head by moving anteriorly, the corresponding brain region would have become separated from the cerebral ganglion by a postero-ventral relocation. moreover, this region would have lost its ganglionic organisation and reverted back to a portion of the medullary nerve cord. studies of early neural development in the onychophoran embryo have revealed no evidence for an origin in the presumptive brain of the neural precursors that give rise to neurons innervating the slime papillae. we therefore regard this scenario as unlikely and suggest that the tritocerebrum was not present in the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda but rather evolved in arthropods.  in summary, our findings suggest an increase in the number of segmental brain regions in the arthropod lineage, from two in the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda, to at least three in various arthropods. this evolutionary sequence may help clarify the phylogenetic position of tardigrada, which is still controversial. currently, tardigrades are regarded as either the sister group of arthropods, of onychophorans, of onychophorans plus arthropods, or of one of the cycloneuralian taxa. our findings suggest that the number of segments in the tardigrade brain, which remains unclear, will be a key feature in elucidating the position of this animal group within the ecdysozoa. furthermore, our suggestion of a two-segmented brain in the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda challenges the hypothesis that a tripartite brain existed in the last common ancestor of the bilaterally symmetrical animals, the so-called ""urbilaterian"". such a brain is absent in all protostomes apart from arthropods. moreover, the closest relatives of chordates, including hemichordates and echinoderms, lack a centralised brain. we therefore suggest that similar gene expression patterns in the anterior body region of arthropods and vertebrates are not related to brain segmentation but rather to a general patterning of the antero-posterior body axis in these animals. "," the composition of the arthropod head is one of the most contentious issues in animal evolution. in particular, controversy surrounds the homology and innervation of segmental cephalic appendages by the brain. onychophora play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of the arthropod brain, because they are close relatives of arthropods and have apparently changed little since the early cambrian. however, the segmental origins of their brain neuropils and the number of cephalic appendages innervated by the brain - key issues in clarifying brain composition in the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda - remain unclear.  using immunolabelling and neuronal tracing techniques in the developing and adult onychophoran brain, we found that the major brain neuropils arise from only the anterior-most body segment, and that two pairs of segmental appendages are innervated by the brain. the region of the central nervous system corresponding to the arthropod tritocerebrum is not differentiated as part of the onychophoran brain but instead belongs to the ventral nerve cords.  our results contradict the assumptions of a tripartite brain in onychophora and instead confirm the hypothesis of bipartite brain composition. they suggest that the last common ancestor of onychophora and arthropoda possessed a brain consisting of protocerebrum and deutocerebrum whereas the tritocerebrum evolved in arthropods.

204," array comparative genomic hybridization is a method used to detect segmental dna copy number alterations and is widely used to discover chromosomal aberrations in cancer and other genetic diseases. in this method, differentially labeled genomic dna samples are competitively hybridized to chromosomal targets, and the copy number balance between the two samples is reflected by their signal intensity ratio. numerous array cgh platforms exist; these vary in the type of elements present on the array and their corresponding coverage of the human genome. with the development of high resolution, genome wide arrays, tens of thousands of loci can be evaluated for copy number status, facilitating the high throughput search for genes potentially involved in pathogenesis. this has allowed the identification of discrete regions of alteration that may have been missed by traditional cytogenetic methods and has proven to be a useful platform for exploring the underlying genetic basis of cancer. with the increasing utilization of array cgh, it has not only become important to establish standards for data deposition, but to develop tools to facilitate public access and to ease mining of available data. currently, the national center for biotechnology information gene expression omnibus repository and european bioinformatics institute arrayexpress provide storage for array cgh data, but these databases have been largely designed for gene expression microarrays. although these sites support visualization of previously analyzed gene expression profiles, there are limited tools available for direct mining and analysis of array cgh data. hence, there is a need for forums specific to array cgh data. recently, attempts have been made in making a database primarily of lower resolution array cgh data. however, with the accumulation of high density array data generated with diverse technology, the viewing of array data has become a bioinformatics challenge, especially when the integration of multiple datasets from different platforms is required. therefore, a central database with analytical software tailored specifically for analyzing and visualizing different types of high resolution array cgh data would greatly facilitate data mining. in this study we have created a database consisting of high-resolution, whole-genome array cgh profiles for nearly commonly used cancer cell lines profiled on four different array platforms, which have been instrumental in biochemical and pharmacogenetic studies. moreover, we have developed a user friendly, web-based java application called the system for integrative genomic microarray analysis for comparative analysis of multiple genomes.  cell-line collection we have assembled a collection of array cgh profiles, representing distinct cell lines profiled on at least one of the four array cgh platforms. moreover, different cancer tissue origins and distinct cancer types are represented in this database, resulting in the assembly of a wide spectrum of genomes in this repository. significantly, of the cgh profiles are unpublished raw data which is now made public. main functionalities of sigma in order to increase the utility of this collection, a significant component of sigma is the web-based application which allows for the user-friendly mining of this dataset. four major types of functionalities are offered by sigma: interrogation of a single sample, visualization and analysis of a single group of samples, comparative analysis of two groups of samples, and integration of data from multiple platforms. visualization and interrogation of a single genome the first function we discuss is the ability to view a single high resolution array cgh profile at multiple magnification levels. the major utility of this function is to display the underlying genomic architecture of a cell line, so that genetic features can be considered in experimental interpretation. for example, a whole genome karyogram of lung adenocarcinoma cell line h profiled on the smrt array platform. from this image, we see many changes such as the loss of the 3p arm as well as segmental changes in chromosomes and specifically, we can select chromosome and view that separately, then zoom into the region of interest and visualize it in finer detail. users can then highlight or place boundary lines in this region and query for which genes are located within the region of interest. subsequently, using the interval search option, users can retrieve the genes which are located in a desired region and have the option to query commonly used biological databases such as ncbi mim, ncbi gene, ncbi pubmed and the ucsc genome browser. for example, if we look at band 8q, we can highlight the region and search the interval for which genes it contains. when we invoke the region search and retrieve only genes curated by refseq, we see there are genes in the amplicon. if the user selects a particular gene, options to link out to the above mentioned biological databases become available. the utility of this function is to facilitate a direct connection from experimental findings to known, relevant information. moreover, the ability to interrogate for specific genes and regions can be done for any types of the analysis outlined. multiple genome comparison and mining across tumor types a common research question is to look across a series of samples with common phenotype to identify recurrent genetic changes, for example comparison of lung adenocarcinomas. with the spectrum of samples warehoused in sigma, such a query can be performed across multiple cancer types. for example, the alignment of a set of samples representing different cancer types revealed common amplification of the myc oncogene locus, while the epidermal growth factor receptor locus is amplified only in a subset of samples. recurrent alterations detected in one group of samples can be compared against those in another group, for example, the comparison of lung squamous cell carcinoma with cervical sqcc. the strategy for comparison, for example the overlay of frequency plots derived from two groups of profiles, has been described elsewhere. simultaneous visualization of data from multiple platforms cross platform comparison is essential to the multi-dimensional descriptions of a genome. here, we have included a feature in sigma to allow users to view multiple platforms of data simultaneously. we use the breast cancer cell line, mcf to illustrate this functionality. data from four different array cgh platforms were available publicly: smrt array, stanford cdna microarray, affymetrix 10k snp array and the affymetrix 100k snp array. figure 4a illustrates the cross platform display of chromosome while figure 4b shows the variable density of coverage by these four commonly used platforms. integrative visualization of dna copy number and methylation one of the novel features we have provided is the integrative visualization of copy number alterations with dna methylation status. the major premise in studying copy number alterations at the dna level is that these are the primary changes involved in driving changes in gene expression. though gene dosage variation may be responsible for expression changes, alteration in dna methylation pattern also contributes significantly to regulating gene expression. recently, methods for global methylation analysis to measure aberrant dna methylation status across tumor genomes have been developed. wilson et al compared methylation patterns with copy number profiles in lung cancer cells. utilizing genomic and epigenetic data from this study for the h lung cancer cell line, we illustrate a parallel display in sigma. figure shows a large segmental copy number gain spanning 1q to 1q with corresponding hypomethylation, localized precisely to 1q. significantly, both copy number gain and decreased methylation can elevate gene expression. the s calcium binding protein a gene within this region has been previously shown to be over-expressed in lung cancer. it is readily apparent of the value of integrative studies examining aberrant dna methylation and genomic copy number. with increased prevalence of studies of whole genome methylation, this feature will be of greater importance.  we have developed an application for the integrative cross platform analysis of array cgh data. the sigma application facilitates consolidation and structuring of diverse sources of array cgh data into a repository that is accessible with a new easy-to-use built-in web-based analytical application. the launch version contains data for array cgh profiles, representing cancer cell lines of over different types of tissue. the ability of sigma to incorporate multiple array cgh platforms facilitates the archiving of array cgh data from future publications, regardless of current or future array platform used. though currently sigma's architecture facilitates the direct mining of genomic and epigenomic data, this can be easily adapted, and not limited to, high resolution genetic and gene expression surveys. "," the prevalence of high resolution profiling of genomes has created a need for the integrative analysis of information generated from multiple methodologies and platforms. although the majority of data in the public domain are gene expression profiles, and expression analysis software are available, the increase of array cgh studies has enabled integration of high throughput genomic and gene expression datasets. however, tools for direct mining and analysis of array cgh data are limited. hence, there is a great need for analytical and display software tailored to cross platform integrative analysis of cancer genomes.  we have created a user-friendly java application to facilitate sophisticated visualization and analysis such as cross-tumor and cross-platform comparisons. to demonstrate the utility of this software, we assembled array cgh data representing affymetrix snp chip, stanford cdna arrays and whole genome tiling path array platforms for cross comparison. this cancer genome database contains profiles from commonly used cancer cell lines representing different tissue types.  in this study we have developed an application for the visualization and analysis of data from high resolution array cgh platforms that can be adapted for analysis of multiple types of high throughput genomic datasets. furthermore, we invite researchers using array cgh technology to deposit both their raw and processed data, as this will be a continually expanding database of cancer genomes. this publicly available resource, the system for integrative genomic microarray analysis of cancer genomes, can be accessed at.

205," the ubiquitous saprophytic mould aspergillus fumigatus is known to cause a spectrum of diseases in humans, including allergic syndromes, noninvasive infections, and invasive aspergillosis, a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.a. fumigatus is one of the human pathogenic fungi that have a natural habitat in the environment, including soil and plants. some members of the azole drug class, which includes voriconazole and posaconazole, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, and for a long time, azole resistance among clinical a. fumigatus isolates was considered to be an uncommon finding. however, multiazole resistance is emerging and is increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure. in agriculture, thousands of tons of azoles are sold annually for the purpose of plant protection, either to prevent or to control fungal growth that can cause extensive loss of crops or to ease the problem of postharvest spoilage of plants and fruits. the mechanism of action of all azoles - irrespectively of their chemical structure and variable biological properties - is based on its interference with the activity of fungal lanosterol alpha-demethylase, an enzyme encoded by cyp51a gene in a. fumigatus that is responsible for the transformation of lanosterol in ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cytoplasmatic membrane. the inhibition of ergosterol formation results in cell membrane disorganization and impairment of fungal growth. therefore, azoles are considered fungistatic rather than fungicidal, and it is well known that a strong and persistent antimicrobial pressure can lead to the selection of resistant clones, particularly if the drug effect is static rather than microbicidal. since azoles are the mainstay treatment for both human and agricultural fungal diseases, a major concern is the predictable emergence of cross-resistance to clinical a. fumigatus isolates that is already observed in several countries, driven by the massive use of azole fungicides in agriculture, which have the same mechanism of action as those used in humans. the aim of our study was to investigate whether prochloraz, an azole extensively used in agriculture, could be associated with the development of cross-resistance to clinical azoles among a. fumigatus.  the three isolates developed a progressive increment of pcz minimal inhibitory concentrations value. in addition, a concomitant increase of the mic of vrc, pos and itraconazole was also observed. during the induction assay, mic of pcz increased times from day until day concerning the clinical azoles, cross-resistance was developed since all isolates changed from a susceptible to a resistant phenotype, according to meletiadis and colleagues. a. fumigatus isolates to prochloraz and clinical azoles a. fumigatus pcz, prochloraz; vrc, voriconazole; pos, posaconazole; itz, itraconazole; flc, fluconazole; Ø, mic after 30 days of culture in the absence of pcz. there are several studies that have characterized azole resistance in a. fumigatus, and most recently some addressed the possible cross-resistance between environmental and medical azoles. our study demonstrated the time frame between the introduction of a widely used agricultural antifungal and the emergence of cross-resistance to medical triazoles. during the induction assay, we found that besides the emergence of cross-resistance, pcz exposure caused marked morphological colony changes, both macroscopically and microscopically. macroscopic modification of the pigmentation of a. fumigatus colonies, changing from the original green colour to white was remarkable at the beginning of the assay. with the increase of mic values of pcz the colonies became scarcer, smaller and totally white. microscopic examination showed a progressive absence of conidiation: the original strain showed normal microscopic features regarding conidiation while almost white colonies showed nearly complete absence of conidiation. the totally white mycelia corresponded solely to hyphae and immature little conidiophore structures without conidia. these changes in pigmentation and in conidiation as a consequence of exposure to azoles have already been reported. varanasi and colleagues speculate that azoles may bind to a phytochrome-like regulatory molecule inhibiting the initiation and subsequent development of conidiophores in aspergillus species. such mechanism of action could also explain the different levels of inhibition displayed by other tested azoles and why echinocandins and polyenes did not show this effect. notably, such morphological changes may be responsible for laboratorial diagnostic misidentification of the fungal genus/species. the high mic values for pcz that were achieved in vitro maintained stable following removal of the selective pressure of the drug. for vrc, the mic value decreased only after 30 days of incubation without the selective pressure, changing the susceptibility phenotype from resistant to intermediate. for pos, the developed mic value also decreased but not enough to change the phenotype of resistance. regarding itz, for both lmf and lmn it was observed the complete reversibility of the resistant phenotype in the absence of pcz, ie, the mic reverted to the initial value. however, strain lmf had, since day zero, itz mic of 2 mg/l, which falls in resistant category. in all the isolates conidiation reappeared together with the typical green colour of mature colonies following the removal of pcz. since pcz was responsible for the emergence of stable resistance to itself and to very important medical triazoles in a. fumigatus, a resistance mechanism may have been developed. previous reports describe cyp51a mutation, efflux pump overexpression and/or target upregulation as the main mechanisms responsible for such resistance. a clonal expansion of isolates harbouring the tr34/l98h mutation has been reported across several countries. interestingly, besides the fact that these resistant isolates are less genetically variable than susceptible ones, no impact on fitness was observed. the phenotypic results and the stability of the developed resistance herein reported suggest the same. future studies aiming to assess the underlying molecular resistance mechanisms, not only from these induced resistant strains but also from isolates with naturally high mic values to pcz and resistant to medical azoles without previous in vitro induction, will certainly be our next step. meanwhile, our study suggests that the abuse of azole antifungals in nature may cause serious human health problems since azole-resistance and cross-resistance has the potential to further compromise the efficacy of clinical azoles in the future. furthermore, we can speculate that the exposure of clinically relevant moulds other than a. fumigatus to agricultural azoles may also be associated with the emergence of cross-resistance to clinical azoles. several compounds are being tested in order to find new antifungal alternatives, anticipating the possible loss of efficacy of clinical azoles. on the other hand, efforts should be made to find safer compounds to use in agriculture.  in order to assess the real dimension of aspergillus resistance, a susceptibility test should be performed in all isolates from patients with aspergillus infection. moreover, for patients with severe infection initial combination therapy may be considered in geographical areas with high prevalence of environmental azole resistant isolates. ultimately, surveillance studies in both clinical and in environment settings should be conducted in order to provide updated local data regarding susceptibility profiles. "," the purpose of this study was to unveil whether azole antifungals used in agriculture, similar to the clinical azoles used in humans, can evoke resistance among relevant human pathogens like aspergillus fumigatus, an ubiquitous agent in nature. additionally, cross-resistance with clinical azoles was investigated. antifungal susceptibility testing of environmental and clinical isolates of a. fumigatus was performed according to the clsi m38-a protocol. in vitro induction assays were conducted involving daily incubation of susceptible a. fumigatus isolates, at 35°c and 180 rpm, in fresh gyep broth medium supplemented with prochloraz, a potent agricultural antifungal, for a period of 30 days. minimal inhibitory concentrations of pcz and clinical azoles were monitored every ten days. in order to assess the stability of the developed mic, the strains were afterwards sub-cultured for an additional 30 days in the absence of antifungal. along the in vitro induction process, microscopic and macroscopic cultural observations were registered.  mic of pcz increased times after the initial exposure; cross-resistance to all tested clinical azoles was observed. the new mic value of agricultural and of clinical azoles maintained stable in the absence of the selective pcz pressure. pcz exposure was also associated to morphological colony changes: macroscopically the colonies became mostly white, losing the typical pigmentation; microscopic examination revealed the absence of conidiation.  pcz exposure induced aspergillus fumigatus morphological changes and an evident increase of mic value to pcz as well as the development of cross-resistance with posaconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. aspergillus fumigatuscross-resistanceclinical and agricultural azoles ",354d288f-40b5-4e23-a454-51844f568685,pubmed
206," the increased use of high-throughput analysis methods, such as microarrays, in mainstream biological research has led to a shift from studying small groups of reasonably well-characterized variables to exploring a complicated mire of thousands of inter-related variables simultaneously. these methods are powerful, but their outputs are complicated and difficult to interpret due to the sheer volume of data produced. interpretation can be prohibitively time consuming in the absence of computational assistance. the ultimate goal of any microarray experiment is to gain insight into the workings of cellular organisms by understanding the interactions of genes and proteins. for this to be accomplished, raw data must not only be converted into information, but this information must also be interpreted in context, to be transformed into timely biological discovery and knowledge. currently, the lack of a community-wide consensus on how best to integrate experimental data with information resources limits this knowledge acquisition. the recent work of saraiya et al. highlighted a ""critical need"" for tools able to ""connect numerical patterns to the underlying biological phenomena"", as current techniques fail to adequately link microarray data to biological meaning, which limits researchers' biological insights. one intuitive way to integrate biological knowledge and microarray data is through protein-interaction networks, where nodes represent proteins and edges symbolize relationships between proteins. however, focusing solely on physical protein interactions, such network constructs neglect a wealth of knowledge currently distributed among hundreds of existing biological databases that is directly applicable to proteins investigated via microarray experiments. current protein network constructs typically focus on a small subset of this biological knowledge, producing incomplete and sparsely populated resources. this is a particular problem for higher eukaryotic organisms such as mice and humans, for which physical protein interaction data are limited. in agreement with lee et al. and leach et al., we demonstrate by expanding the definition of'interaction' to include functional information that a) there is enough publicly available biological information to produce biologically useful, well populated interaction networks for higher eukaryotic species, b) through the combination of expression data and functional information, it is possible to provide contextual insight into the network, and c) it is possible to effectively link to existing biological knowledge using current technology. using a murine craniofacial developmental expression microarray dataset and a recently published technique for weighting and integrating functional interaction information, we illustrate how the application of context sensitive methodology leverages the full force of current available biological knowledge, enabling the translation of complex high-throughput datasets into scientific insight and discovery. methods microarray expression data a comprehensive murine craniofacial developmental expression dataset was used in this study. expression was analyzed through the microdissection of mandibular, maxillary and frontonasal prominences at time points e –e at day increments. expression was measured using the affymetrix moe430_2a microarray system. microarray probes, corresponding to unique mgi identifiers, were clustered using the manova test statistic in r. hierarchical complete clustering was undertaken on the resulting correlation coefficients. the resultant tree was cut to produce clusters. explicit and implicit data sources traditionally an'interaction' between two proteins is defined as a physical association. here we expand the term to include functional relationships between pairs of proteins. functional interaction information was retrieved from a number of different resources falling into either of two categories: explicit and implicit. explicit sources indicate a direct interaction between a pair of genes/proteins, and include experimentally measured physical, biochemical and genetic interactions, and computationally predicted gene neighborhoods, gene fusion events, or conserved phylogenetic profiles. implicit sources provide information pertaining to an individual gene or protein attribute, which may be shared by any given pair of genes or proteins. such attributes include literature references, sequence motifs, protein categories, protein complexes, phenotypes, cellular location, molecular function, and biological processes and pathways. network construction, weighting and visualization genes within any given cluster were defined to be the nodes in our network constructs; a network was produced for each cluster identified from the hierarchical complete clustering stage. data from both implicit and explicit sources were used to define arc interactions between pairs of proteins. applying the cons noisyor methodology of leach et al., the edges between each pair of nodes were assigned a combined reliability score based on the individual reliabilities of the sources asserting the edge. resultant networks were viewed using cytoscape. network identification and interrogation based on significant tissue-restricted expression and progressive increase in expression from embryonic day to e, a network of interest was identified comprising nodes. by using cytoscape's ability to display edge attributes, rapid orientation within the sub-network was achieved. recognizing implicit functional themes common to nodes and edges across the sub-network facilitated the identification of key information such as shared pathways, processes, locations and phenotypes, as well as over-represented protein families. this approach provides a high-level overview of the networks functional composition, which subsequently directs the user towards more focused analysis of individual nodes and their pairwise interactions. each pair of nodes and associated interactions were reviewed through the exploration of'links' within cytoscape to a number of biological resources. although we were working with murine developmental expression microarray data, our goal was to gain insight into human developmental processes. pertinent information is distributed across both mouse and human resources, thus requiring all investigations be repeated to ensure that valuable data were not overlooked simply due to their residing in a species-specific entry or database. in addition to mining these associated database entries, a corpus of relevant literature was compiled by following links from each implicit source. this corpus was then manually assessed and interpreted in order to extract key information. the network construction method applied here provides a maximum of possible functional interactions per edge. the edge with the most support in this network was between myod and myog, and was asserted by nine sources. therefore, even with a structured interrogation strategy guided by both expression data and functional interactions, pursuing all informative leads was not a minor task. considerable time was dedicated to the interpretation of the significance of each element. in this example, approximately hours of expert user time was required. the process is cyclical, where new information not only informs future discoveries, but previous work is frequently revisited to be viewed within new contexts.  a mandibular-specific network: finding novelty the group of proteins was clustered on the basis of correlated mrna expression, and with the construction of the network the goal was to develop biological hypotheses explaining the observed correlation. those edges with the most support frequently comprise well-documented relationships between the proteins encoded by these genes. those edges with less support are therefore more likely to represent novel, as-yet uncharacterized relationships and so generate new hypotheses. in this instance, a number of nodes were linked by edges asserted by a single expert. chebi is a dictionary of molecular entities focusing on'small' chemical compounds of biological relevance and encompasses ontological classifications. interestingly, these nodes and edges also formed a discrete sub-network. although each of these nodes has reasonable amounts of associated biological knowledge, only the chebi data provided the shared functional interaction categorizations required for network construction. this sub-graph of nodes, exhibiting correlated and progressively up-regulated expression in mandibular tissue during mouse development, thus provided a unique opportunity to search for truly novel biological hypotheses. data present represented by a ✓, absent by -. the common theme: calcium and lipids by observing the sub-graph as a group of interacting proteins, the implicit functional information displayed through the presence of edges can be taken together to produce a strong and unified voice capable of highlighting themes which may have otherwise gone unnoticed if only single, unassociated implicit resources were used. in this instance, the chebi terms on which the network was constructed were ""calcium"" and ""lipids"". cumulative evidence from go and kegg highlighted themes around muscle, acyl-coa, lipids, signaling, and calcium signaling. of the nodes, only nr5a had a mgi phenotype association. nr5a knockouts exhibit digestive, alimentary, and immune disruption, and are embryonic lethals. insights from primary literature primary databases also provided a source of literature. publications attached to go annotations, generifs, and phenotypes can subsequently be explored further. published literature is the gold standard for classification and description of biological functions; however, much of the knowledge in this vast resource is difficult to assess in the absence of prior knowledge of what to query for. searching for pertinent information regarding all associated genes in the original network and craniofacial disorder constitutes a formidable challenge due to the extremely large number of primary papers returned. however, the task becomes more manageable when the user has an insight into the relationships among a smaller subgroup of genes. in this instance, it was more productive to search over the chebi-specific sub-network for nfatc a role in mandibular development, known associations with actn sned fkbp galntl efhd and megf and any associations with calcium signaling. by having a structured network rather than a gene list, mining the associated literature became a more targeted and thus more fruitful task. as expected, the published literature provided a wealth of existing knowledge, and a putative biological pathway loosely centered on calcineurin was hypothesized to explain the correlated expression of the genes. in the absence of a network to guide investigations, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to associate these genes in a biologically meaningful way without domain-specific prior knowledge. the importance of leveraging pre-existing biological knowledge although the availability and application of high-throughput methods such as expression microarray technology has been a key advance in biological research, the biological research community is still grappling with how best to harness the power of this technology. biologists are dependent upon computational methodologies to help them navigate and interpret their raw data, and as such the ability of the biologist to generate new insights, hypotheses and discoveries is intimately associated to the methodology's ability to assist effective discovery of biologically meaningful information. saraiya et al. highlighted how failing to link microarray data to existing biological knowledge prevents biologists from leveraging their domain expertise to construct higher level, biologically relevant hypotheses. they argued that it was ""imperative that users be able to access and link biological information to their data"". in agreement with this point, the study presented here illustrates how effective access to pre-existing knowledge can drive biological discovery. inadequate access to this wealth of information ultimately hinders scientific discovery. we have demonstrated that through the combination of both explicit and implicit data and a permissive visualization environment such as cytoscape, it is possible to link large-scale microarray datasets to biological information in a manner which facilitates hypothesis generation.  the approach outlined here will be particularly useful when applied to analyses of large-scale datasets to help understand the processes implicated in complex, multi-factorial disorders. in addition to the example presented here, application of this methodology to analysis of our craniofacial developmental expression microarray dataset has led to identification and validation of four genes not previously implicated in craniofacial development. we believe this methodology will be of significant use to the wider scientific community, and we are therefore also currently working towards explicitly capturing and automating this analysis protocol and developing a user interface to facilitate ease of investigation. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions hjt participated in the design of the

"," in response to the frequently overwhelming output of high-throughput microarray experiments, we propose a methodology to facilitate interpretation of biological data in the context of existing knowledge. through the probabilistic integration of explicit and implicit data sources a functional interaction network can be constructed. each edge connecting two proteins is weighted by a confidence value capturing the strength and reliability of support for that interaction given the combined data sources. the resulting network is examined in conjunction with expression data to identify groups of genes with significant temporal or tissue specific patterns. in contrast to unstructured gene lists, these networks often represent coherent functional groupings.  by linking from shared functional categorizations to primary biological resources we apply this method to craniofacial microarray data, generating biologically testable hypotheses and identifying candidate genes for craniofacial development.  the novel methodology presented here illustrates how the effective integration of pre-existing biological knowledge and high-throughput experimental data drives biological discovery and hypothesis generation. 10– march the first summit on translational bioinformatics san francisco, ca, usa ",fdfbf137-6d6f-4c48-87bb-501022193edf,pubmed
207," eukaryotic cells, from yeast to human, contain large nonlysosomal proteases called proteasomes. the 26s proteasome is part of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, which regulates proteins through a mechanism of selective degradation. the 26s proteasome is composed of a 20s proteasome as a catalytic core and regulatory particles at either end. the subunits of the 20s proteasome subunits can be classified into two families, α and β. in eukaryotes, the 20s proteasome contains seven α-type subunits and seven β-type subunits. the fourteen kinds of subunits are arranged in four rings of seven subunits and form an α7β7β7α structure. fully grown frog oocytes arrest in the late g phase of meiosis. maturation-inducing hormone acts on the oocytes, inducing final maturation and triggering germinal vesicle breakdown, and the oocytes arrest again at the second meiotic metaphase until fertilization. the proteasomes are thought to be involved in regulating the maturation and fertilization of oocytes. previously we identified the proteasomal subunit modified during oocyte maturation in xenopus and goldfish as α. in the present study, we cloned three unidentified α-type subunits of xenopus and prepared antibodies for a total of five subunits. using a set of specific antibodies, we analyzed changes in all α subunits composing the 26s proteasome during the meiotic cell cycle. we demonstrated that of the subunits exist as a heterogeneous population in frog oocytes and identified another subunit in addition to α which was modified meiotic cell cycle dependently.  isolation and characterization of cdna clones a blast search of the xenopus est database was conducted using known proteasomal subunit α cdnas. from the data for each subunit, full-length orfs were obtained by pcr. the amplified cdnas were and bp long. the clones encode proteins of and amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of and daltons, respectively. comparison of the amino acid sequence revealed that these molecules are highly homologous to the α α and α subunits in humans, drosophila and yeast. thus, we concluded that the cdnas isolated in this study encode the α α and α subunits of the xenopus 20s proteasome. we named these clones α1_xl, α5_xl and α6_xl according to a systematic nomenclature. figure represents a comparison of amino acid sequences predicted from cdna sequences of α-type subunits of the xenopus 20s proteasome. overall identity between the subunits was – %. a consensus sequence for α-type proteasomal subunits was conserved. interestingly, a conserved sequence for β-type proteasomal subunits was found in the α subunit. comparison of proteasomes purified from immature and mature oocytes polyclonal antibodies specific for five subunits were raised against purified recombinant proteins. the specificity of the antibodies was examined by immunoblotting with the cytosol fraction and the purified 26s proteasome. each antibody preparation displayed a specific reaction for different polypeptides in both samples. recombinant proteins from the cdnas clearly cross-reacted with each antibody. thus, specific antibodies for each subunit were prepared. with these antibodies and previously described monoclonal antibodies for subunits α and α, changes to all α-type subunits during xenopus meiotic maturation were analyzed. the modifications were demonstrated by 2d-page. the α subunit antibodies gave a single spot but all of the other antisera produced more than one spot, suggesting that the α1–α subunits undergo some type of modification in oocytes of xenopus as demonstrated in other species. a difference in the spots between the 26s proteasome from immature and mature oocytes was detected in the blots of subunits α and α in blots of α and α only a major spot was detected in the 26s proteasome from mature oocytes. it is suggested that the α subunit is phosphorylated in immature oocytes and dephosphorylated in mature oocytes. likewise, it is speculated that part of the α subunit is phosphorylated in interphase and dephosphorylated in metaphase. these results suggest that the subunits of 26s proteasomes are changed by meiotic cell cycle-dependent modifications. it can be speculated that these modifications are involved in the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle. the modification of proteasomal subunits and factors interacting with proteasomes may be involved in the regulation of proteasome function. by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, up to different polypeptides were separated from the 20s proteasome which was shown to be composed of gene products. furthermore, changes in proteasomal subunit composition under different physiological conditions and the likely existence of a different subpopulation of proteasomes have been reported. all these results suggest that the subunit composition of proteasomes, and likely their activity, is under complex control in vivo. some of these changes may be due to post-translational modifications of the proteasomal subunits. regarding protein modification, there have been several reports about the phosphorylation of proteasomal subunits. phosphorylated proteasomal subunits were detected in crude preparations from cultured drosophila cells. several subunits of the 20s proteasome could be phosphorylated in vitro by a cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase copurifying with the bovine pituitary 20s proteasome. castaño et al. identified the ckii phosphorylating subunit and its phosphorylation sites as the c component and serine- and serine- respectively. ckii was also reported to phosphorylate the c component in rice. the phosphorylation of subunits in the 26s proteasome in vivo was investigated using cultured human cells. mason et al. showed the phosphorylated subunits to be the c and c components in the 20s core, and the s subunit and several other components in regulatory particles. recent approaches have revealed post-translational modifications to many of the subunits. in the yeast 20s proteasome, the α2- and α4-subunits are phosphorylated at either a serine or threonine residue, and the α7-subunit is phosphorylated at tyrosine residue. in the human 20s proteasome, more than two spots were identified in all α-type subunits except α and phosphorylation of the α7-subunit at serine- was revealed. however the sites and kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of the α and α subunits of the 20s proteasome have yet to be demonstrated. the modification of these proteins is one possible mechanism regulating the functions of the 26s proteasome during the meiotic cell cycle. consensus sequences for phosphorylation sites are conserved in these subunits. cyclic-amp dependent protein kinase is responsible for the g2/m and metaphase/anaphase transitions. calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is shown to be involved in the exit from metaphase ii arrest at fertilization in xenopus. it can be hypothesized that these kinases are involved in the regulation of 26s proteasome activity. the identification of kinases and the phosphorylation sites of the α and α subunits may reveal how the modification of proteasomal subunits is involved in controlling the cell cycle. currently, we have identified one of the protein kinase for α subunit as casein kinaseiα. possible regulation of 26s proteasome activity by this kinase is under investigation. recently, alternative subunits of proteasomes have been identified. in drosophila where alternative α-type, β-type and 19s cap subunits are expressed from separate genes during spermatogenesis and in arabidopsis and rice where alternative isoforms of most proteasome subunits are differentially expressed from separate genes during development. there are also examples of alternative β-type subunits in mammals. alternative subunits have yet to be identified in xenopus, there is a possibility that the changes in the spots identified in this study may derive from differential expression of alternative subunits from paralogous genes.  cdnas for three α-type proteasome subunits of x. laevis were identified. six subunits but not α7_xl are modified in immature oocytes in x. laevis. α α4_xls are modified during the meiotic cell cycle in x. laevis. "," the 26s proteasome is the proteolytic machinery of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system responsible for most of the regulated intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. previously, we demonstrated meiotic cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of α subunit of the 26s proteasome. in this study, we analyzed the changes in the spotting pattern separated by 2-d gel electrophoresis of α subunits during xenopus oocyte maturation.  we identified cdna for three α-type subunits of xenopus, then prepared antibodies specific for five subunits. with these antibodies and previously described monoclonal antibodies for subunits α and α modifications to all α-type subunits of the 26s proteasome during xenopus meiotic maturation were examined by 2d-page. more than one spot for all subunits except α was identified. immunoblot analysis of 26s proteasomes purified from immature and mature oocytes showed a difference in the blots of α and α with an additional spot detected in the 26s proteasome from immature oocytes.  six of α-type subunits of the xenopus 26s proteasome are modified in xenopus immature oocytes and two subunits are modified meiotic cell cycle-dependently.
