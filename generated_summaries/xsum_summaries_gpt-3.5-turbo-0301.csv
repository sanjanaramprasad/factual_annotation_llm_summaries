10466,"According to animal protection group the RSPCA the dogs had likely been shot. And many were abandoned there, near Bundaberg in the state's south-east, some time ago.
""It's probably likely it was a common dumping ground,"" RSPCA Queensland spokesman Michael Beatty told the BBC.
""We've always known that there's wastage within the industry, but to find 55 bodies in one spot is a bit disturbing.""
Police and the RSPCA are now investigating the find as part of a joint taskforce established in Queensland following an expose by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) earlier this year into the practice of ""live baiting"" within the greyhound racing industry across the nation.
The ABC aired disturbing footage of greyhounds chasing live pigs, possums and rabbits around tracks. The ""bait"" animals were tied to mechanical lures before being chased and mauled to death by dogs during training sessions.
Trainers and owners were blooding their dogs - giving them a taste of blood before the chase - to make them faster in competition, despite the practice being illegal.
Only 2,000 of the roughly 20,000 greyhound puppies born each year in Australia live to a full life span of about 12 years, according to Animals Australia, which provided footage of live baiting to the ABC.
Most are killed at a young age after their racing career is over, or are euthanised as puppies because they are unwanted.
In the wake of February's broadcast, four Australian states - NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania - have launched inquiries into the greyhound racing industry. Dozens of trainers have been suspended across the country, some have been banned from ever participating in greyhound racing again and others have been charged under animal cruelty laws.
In NSW, the entire governing board for the sport was suspended from duty.
Greyhound Rescue, a voluntary group based in Sydney that houses greyhounds abandoned after their racing careers end, has welcomed increased scrutiny of the industry.
But it was not surprised by the shallow grave found this week in Queensland. Jessica Crause, from Greyhound Rescue, said the discovery was not unusual.
Late last year, Greyhound Rescue found Napoleon, a former racing greyhound, wandering the streets of Sydney.
He was starving, had pressure sores on his body from lying on concrete and bitumen, rocks in his stomach, and black teeth from scavenging.
The vet who treated him described his condition as the worst he had ever seen in a dog.
""He was so emaciated and covered thickly in fleas - so much so that the vet nurses cried as they bathed him,"" recalls Nora Anderson-Dieppe, also from Greyhound Rescue.
The Sydney-based charity, which takes up to 250 greyhounds into its care each year in New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory, finds homes for as many of the dogs as it can. Some have been abandoned, others are handed over directly by trainers who have no use for the dogs anymore.
But given the sheer numbers of greyhounds bred for racing, it says it is fighting an up-hill battle. It says it receives puppies with untreated traumatic paw amputations, dogs with festering wounds, animals beaten by their trainers or used as breeding bitches for too many years, among other things.
Some animal rights groups, including Animals Australia, have called for the entire industry to be shut down.
""I don't know how you could call for anything but an end to greyhound racing,"" Lisa Chalk, a spokeswoman for the animal rights group, told the BBC.
Code of silence
Australia is one of only eight countries in the world where a commercial greyhound industry still exists. In addition to the UK, New Zealand and Ireland, Macau, Mexico and Vietnam have money-spinning racing.
In the United States, where it is also a commercial sport, greyhound racing is on the way out. The main anti-greyhound industry group, GREY2K, reports 39 states have now banned commercial dog racing. In only seven states is it still a viable operation.
But greyhound proponents say there is still a future in the sport.
""There's a bit of a code of silence hanging over the whole show and a legacy of handed-down practices,"" says Geoff Slattery, a former sports editor of Melbourne newspaper The Sunday Age, who breeds and trains dogs for racing.
He said public exposure of archaic and sometimes illegal practices could help the sport.
""Bad things can actually make good things happen,"" he says.
Mr Slattery believes says the industry needs a tough national oversight body with a good governance structure and the authority to enforce strict regulations, along with a tightening of licensing rules to make participation a more rigorous process.
""It's pretty much been an amateur sport and still is,"" he says. ""[Under a stricter system] you may have a loss of numbers or you may have a tighter control over the numbers.""
The existing national body, Greyhounds Australasia, which oversees racing in Australia and New Zealand, is ""toothless and all but irrelevant"", he says.
Greyhounds Australasia's newly-appointed chief executive officer, Scott Parker, said the industry, which employs more than 10,000 people, should not be punished as a whole because of the actions of a few.
""Recent evidence that a small number of the sport's 50,000 participants were using live bait as a training method horrified industry administrators,"" he says.
""Australian greyhound racing is a A$1bn ($770m; Â£520m) industry providing hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to state and territory governments annually. It is administered by statutory authorities whose boards are appointed by ministers for racing.""
In March, Victoria's Racing Integrity Commission cleared that state's Greyhound Racing board of any knowledge of animal cruelty. The board members nonetheless resigned en masse shortly after the commission's interim report was released.
But Lisa Chalk of Animals Australia believes that when gambling and animals are combined, the animals will always come last. ""Animals come second to profit,"" she says.

The issue of animal cruelty in the industry was first exposed in February 2015, with more states now launching inquiries into the industry as a result.
","The discovery of 55 greyhound dog bodies buried in a mass grave in Queensland has led to increased scrutiny of the greyhound racing industry in Australia.

Live baiting scandals have been widely reported, where lures carrying live animals such as rabbits, pigs and possums were used to teach greyhounds to race. The industry is challenging to police as it is both and amateur and professional sport that is tightly woven into the Australian community, creating resistance to dramatic legislative remedies.

9511,"No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful.
And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF).
Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?
Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.
Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.
Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (""there is no alternative"").
What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.
Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.
Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).
There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.
So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.
Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.
So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.",I haven't been in Greece for three weeks but I am told it is eerily quiet and - in respect of tourism - surprisingly busy.,33847273,xsum,"The Greek people are not taking to the streets to protest against the recent VAT increases and pension cuts, as well as the expected farm subsidy cuts, controversial privatisations, and the opening up of industries to competition; the author suggests that people are waiting to see just what Tsipras has conceded in order to obtain €86bn of new credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF. The author argues that good economics and politics require the easing of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half, and that any deal will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.  
 
","Greece's resorts are busy with tourists, but the country's citizens are not protesting against austerity measures and liberalisation policies proposed by the Syriza government.

5655,"Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced plans last week to form an 11-person panel to review football's scandal-hit world governing body.
Domenico Scala had earlier said he would only lead the taskforce if he is guaranteed full independence.
The Swiss businessman is already the independent chair of Fifa's audit and compliance committee.
Scala was believed to have been prepared to lead the taskforce, after meeting presidents of three of Fifa's six continental confederations.
But a spokesman for Scala told BBC Sport: ""Domenico Scala never applied for such a chairmanship.""
He added that the post would only be considered ""under the strict condition"" that ""independence was guaranteed"".
As well as an independent chair, the taskforce will have two representatives from the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean) and Uefa (Europe), as well as one representative from each of Conmebol (South America) and the OFC (Oceania).
In a statement, Fifa said representatives from federations would not necessarily have to be ""members of the football community"" and the confederations could decide that themselves.
Blatter, who has announced his intention to stand down as president, has said presidential term limits and integrity checks for top officials are potential areas of reform.
Recommendations are due to be presented at the next meeting of Fifa's executive committee in Zurich on 24 and 25 September.
The prospect of Scala leading an independent review of Fifa was described as ""laughable"" by campaign group New Fifa Now.
And Alexandra Wrage, who resigned from Fifa's independent governance committee in April 2013 in protest at a lack of meaningful action, said even an independent chairman of the reform taskforce ""can't work"".
She told BBC Sport: ""The process needs to be taken out of Fifa's hands. Short of that, it's another reform dead-end.""
Blatter's resignation on 2 June followed the arrest of seven Fifa officials as part of a United States investigation that saw 14 people indicted on corruption charges.

4891,"Further caps are coming into effect on roaming - or connection - charges within all 28 countries of the European Union (EU).
From June next year, roaming charges in the EU will be abolished completely.
The government said that those making calls, downloading data or texting would save millions of pounds in charges following the latest changes.
""Roughly a million Brits stay the night in Europe every day, and they spend around Â£350m a year on roaming charges,"" said Ed Vaizey, the minister for the digital economy.
""So by realising these changes, we're going to save British consumers millions of pounds a year.""
The charge cap will also apply in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Consumers pay roaming charges whenever they connect to an operator based abroad. The charges are in addition to the cost of the call itself, and for short calls they can make up a large proportion of the overall fee.
The biggest reductions will be for people downloading data - such as emails, pictures or social media - where the roaming charge will be cut by about 75%.
Charges for outgoing phone calls will be cut by a similar amount. The charge for texting will be reduced by about 66%.
So whereas those making a phone call in Europe would previously have paid roughly 16.5p to get connected, they will now pay just 4p. The charge is repeated for every minute of the call.
Data downloads, which previously cost a maximum of 17.4p, will also now cost 4p for each megabyte of data.
When the call charges themselves are taken into consideration, the government says the average total cost of a phone call should fall by more than half.
Not all customers will see a reduction, however, as some operators include roaming charges within special packages.
O2 said most of its customers would see immediate reductions, while EE said the majority of its customers would not be affected. Three already provides free roaming for most of its customers in a limited number of countries.
Mr Vaizey questioned what would happen to the roaming charge caps should the UK vote to leave the EU.
""I don't know what would happen if we leave the EU, and that's the problem,"" he told the BBC.
""They might stay, or they might not stay.""
The controls on charges are being introduced under an EU regulation - not a directive - which means they have not been specifically incorporated into UK law.
So if the UK voted to leave the EU, it could decide whether it wanted to keep them or not.
The Vote Leave campaign said the UK would be able to retain the price caps if it wanted to.
""These charges are being abolished across Europe and abroad. There is no evidence to suggest that they will go up if we vote leave,"" said Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave.",UK consumers using their mobile phones in Europe will see reductions in their bills from Saturday.,36171266,xsum,"Caps on roaming charges within the European Union will come into effect, reducing the cost of making calls, downloading data and texting while people are abroad.

7681,"At a campaign rally, he called the South Carolina senator an ""idiot"" and then told the crowd to try the number.
A Politico reporter called the number on Tuesday, and Mr Graham answered.
Mr Graham recently called Mr Trump ""a jackass"" and condemned the real estate mogul's comments about Senator John McCain.
Mr Trump has come under increasing criticism from fellow Republicans and veterans groups after he appeared to disparage Mr McCain's war record.
""He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured,"" he said, referring to Mr McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
Recent national polls show Mr Trump with a double-digit lead over his closest Republican rival.
However the polling was mostly conducted before the controversial comments about Mr McCain.
His rivals are becoming increasingly frustrated as Mr Trump continues to dominate the media coverage of the crowded Republican race.
Mr Trump has drawn headlines since he called undocumented Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" when he launched his campaign in June.
""The world is literally falling apartâ€¦ and all we're talking about is Donald Trump,"" Mr Graham told CNN on Monday.
To question the military record of Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war tortured so brutally that he is unable still to raise his arms above his shoulders, would ordinarily have been suicidal.
But Trump is operating under rules of his own making that are perfectly suited to the voracious metabolism of the modern media, and the hyperventilated style of modern campaigning.
The more outrageous his remarks, the more coverage and social media comment he generates. And the more coverage he receives, the better his polling numbers seemingly become.

6270,"A study of more than 250 plants and animals suggests their ability to adapt to changes in rainfall and temperature will be vastly outpaced by future climate change.
Amphibians, reptiles and plants are particularly vulnerable, according to US researchers.
And tropical species are at higher risk than those in temperate zones.
Some animals might be able to move geographically to cope with rising temperatures, but others live in isolated areas where they cannot move, such as in nature reserves or on mountains or islands.
Ecologists analysed how quickly species had changed their climatic niches (the conditions where they can survive) over time, and how these rates compared with that of global warming.
They analysed 266 populations of plants and animals, including insects, amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles.
Rates of change in climatic niches were much slower than rates of projected climate change, by more than 200,000 fold for temperature (on average), they said.
""Overall, our results show that rates of climatic niche change among populations of plants and animals are dramatically slower than projected rates of future climate change,"" said Tereza Jezkova and John Wiens, of the University of Arizona.
Mammals and birds might be better placed to survive than amphibians and reptiles, because they had the ability to regulate their own body temperatures, said Dr Wiens.
And, while some species might be able to move to higher latitudes or elevations to survive, ""for a lot of organisms, that is not an option"".
""It's a double jeopardy of climate change and habitat destruction,"" he told BBC News.
The research is published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.

9121,"It said lack of awareness and a shortage of trainees meant police often ended up questioning adults with mental illness or learning issues without one.
Home Secretary Theresa May said the situation was ""not acceptable"".
Appropriate adults are trained volunteers who help with communication during police interviews.
They are supposed to ensure mentally vulnerable people who are arrested or questioned understand what is happening, and that their legal rights and welfare are safeguarded.
They were introduced in the 1980s following miscarriages of justice involving vulnerable people.
Local authorities are required to provide appropriate adults whenever children are in contact with police and there is no parent or guardian present, but there is no duty to do the same in respect of vulnerable adults.
In some areas, no organised scheme for adults exists.
Researchers analysed police data and found appropriate adults were used in about 45,000 of the 1.4m detentions and voluntary interviews of adults each year.
It is estimated that 280,000 of those detentions involves a person who is ""mentally vulnerable"".
What does an appropriate adult do?
Appropriate adults do not provide legal advice, but assist with rights and broader welfare.
Nuala Chapman, an appropriate adult, told BBC Radio 5 live that she would be called after a medical practitioner had decided someone in custody needed support.
""We then go to the station, we go through all the processes with them, we make sure they understand what is going on, we go through interview with them and... facilitate communication between all the people in the interview,"" she said.
""Our role ends once they have either been charged or bailed.""
The report, entitled There to Help, found police were least likely to identify vulnerability in areas which did not have an organised appropriate adult scheme.
Custody officers reported spending hours trying to find a suitable appropriate adult. They admitted to sometimes asking random members of the public, or proceeding without one.
Chris Bath, chief executive of the National Appropriate Adult Network, the charity which led the study, said: ""People with learning disabilities, mental ill health, traumatic brain injuries or autistic spectrum disorders are some of the most vulnerable citizens, and state detention is perhaps the most vulnerable situation.
""We have a moral and a legal duty to ensure appropriate adults are available wherever people live.""
The report's recommendations include:
The home secretary said appropriate adults ""provide vital support and help to demystify what can be a confusing, sometimes frightening, experience in police custody"".
Mrs May added: ""The status quo is not acceptable and I am concerned that vulnerable adults are not always receiving the support of an appropriate adult.
""We are currently examining the recommendations and implementation options to ensure that vulnerable people are provided with the support they are entitled to.""
Avtar Bhatoa, from the Law Society, said appropriate adults were needed to ensure ""fair justice for all"".
""With the right support, mentally vulnerable people are less likely to suffer an injustice or to waive their right to free legal advice through fear and misunderstanding, which can compound their disadvantage in the justice system, "" he said.","Up to a quarter of a million vulnerable people are not being supported by an ""appropriate adult"" while in police custody, a Home Office report suggests.",34054636,xsum,"A recent report has found that vulnerable adults with mental illness or learning issues are often questioned by police without the support of a trained volunteer known as an “appropriate adult”.

6281,"Corran ""Coz"" Powell, 21, died following the collision in Braintree, Essex, in December 2014.
His family is raising money to buy a particular area of land on which he dreamed about running outdoor survival courses for disadvantaged young people.
The centre would also be used as a venue for new bands and charity events.
""I can't think of anything else we could have done that was more fitting, or more Coz,"" his mother Gennie said.
""I think he'd be 100% behind it. If he's watching now he'd be saying 'Come on Mum, keep going'.
Mrs Powell said even if they could not raise enough money to buy the land ""he loved and built his plans around"", his relatives would make sure they followed through ""even if it's just three acres"".
Mrs Powell said her son, who was from Gosfield, Essex, dreamt of ""teaching other young people to understand, be safe in and respect our countryside"".
""He loved being active outdoors and having been introduced to woodland survival was passionate about the skills and confidence it gave him,"" she said.
On the family's fundraising page, Mrs Powell wrote: ""We have the skills and knowledge to set up the kind of Centre that Coz had in mind but we do not have the money.""

3748,"Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said the idea was ""attractive"" and could help tackle poverty and inequality.
Supporters said it would help unemployed people who fear taking a job would lead to cuts in their benefits.
But Patrick Minford from Cardiff University's Business School said it was ""not a workable scheme"".
Under Universal Basic Income (UBI) everyone would receive the same sum of money regardless of whether they work or not.
There would be no requirements to show an individual is looking for a job either.
In Scotland the policy has support from across the political spectrum, with feasibility work under way ahead of possible pilot schemes in Glasgow and Fife.
Jamie Cooke, head of the RSA think tank in Scotland, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme: ""Moving from a system where you aren't working to a system where you are, you won't face those penalties, you retain your consistent payment.
""You're given the security to be able to choose to work... or training, or to set up your own business in a way that is beneficial to you.""
However Prof Minford, who was an adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, told the programme: ""This is not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive.
""It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all.""
Mr Drakeford told the assembly earlier in January he found the idea of UBI ""attractive in the way that it can simplify and support people who currently have to rely on a very complex set of part-time work, part-time benefits and so on"".
But he added: ""The political world will face a job of convincing the public about the merits of the scheme.""
Asked if he was worried by Mr Drakeford's comments, Prof Minford replied: ""It's quite worrying for Wales.

7100,"Ed Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical worker for the CIA, has since revealed himself to be the source of the leaks in an interview with the Guardian news website.
US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.
""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian.","Both international governments and the world's biggest tech companies are in crisis following the leaking of documents that suggest the US government was able to access detailed records of individual smartphone and internet activity, via a scheme called Prism.",22839609,xsum,"In 2013, former technical worker for the CIA Ed Snowden leaked documents that revealed the extent of US government surveillance of citizens' online activity.

Robert Nieri has been fundraising for a plaque to go outside his birthplace to mark 100 years since his death.
He said Kilpin was the ""father of Italian football"" and deserved more recognition in Nottingham.
You can read more stories about people who have helped shape sport on our Pinterest board
The footballer, who was born at the back of a butcher's shop in Mansfield Road, started Milan Football and Cricket Club in 1899.
Kilpin led the club to its first three championships and even designed its legendary red and black striped shirt.
He died in 1916, aged 46, and his grave was believed lost until a historian tracked it down.
In 1999, AC Milan paid for a new tombstone and he was reburied in the Monumental Cemetery in Milan.
Kilpin's name adorns shirts in Milan and his image can be seen on giant banners on match days.
However, in Nottingham, there has been little recognition of his achievements and writer Mr Nieri set out to change that.
""We need to bring Kilpin to the fore,"" he said.
""He is the founder of one of the most successful clubs in the world and the father of Italian football.
""He taught the Italians to play. He's massive [in Milan].""
On 22 October, the 100th anniversary of Kilpin's death, a ceremony will take place outside his birthplace, and the Sheriff of Nottingham will name a bus after him.
Mr Nieri, whose book The Lord of Milan is set to be released, is also due to fly to Italy to start filming a documentary about the star.
The humble man who made Milan
Details about Herbert Kilpin's remarkable life only started to emerge over the past few decades.
How did a whisky-guzzling, chain-smoking son of a butcher from Nottingham come to set up one of the world's biggest and most successful clubs?
Other English ex-pats helped him, of course, but it is Kilpin who has remained in the imagination here and in Italy.
While his friends became part of the fledgling Italian football association, Kilpin just wanted to play football.
And that is why, according to some, he is a ""grassroots football icon"" - concerned only by what happened on the pitch.
It is hoped more recognition of his story will inspire a generation of young footballers.

6506,"The report by the UN Agency for Human Settlements says that the richest 20% of the population on average earn 20 times more than the poorest 20%.
According to the study, Guatemala is the country with the widest disparity, and Venezuela the most equitable one.

The report, State of the Cities of Latin America, suggests that by 2050, nearly nine out of 10 Latin Americans will live in cities and its authors suggest Latin American nations use the current period of relative economic stability and slower population growth to make life in the cities more equitable.

11141,"Argentine journalists have become accustomed, after eight years under Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's presidency, to getting little or no access to the person at the top.
For all her appearances at inaugurations of public works or rousing speeches before the Peronist party faithful, President Fernandez de Kirchner rarely exposes herself to scrutiny and even less so to the kind of open press forum that enables journalists to question and probe the work of her government.
Not that Mr Macri was particularly illuminating or generous with detail, particularly when asked about the specifics of his plans to turn around Argentina's precarious economy.
But at least he made the effort to engage and respond to questions.
So what have we learned in the first few days about the man who defeated a political movement that has dominated Argentine politics for decades?
The outgoing mayor of Buenos Aires and soon to be president of Argentina repeated on more than one occasion that he could not yet expand on the detail of his economic plans until he was able to ascertain exactly how critical the situation was.
The current administration has been repeatedly accused of being less than transparent about key statistics like the real rate of inflation or exactly how much liquid reserves remain in the Central Bank coffers.
Correcting those anomalies and introducing measures to restore international confidence in the Argentine economy are likely to be some of Mauricio Macri's first big policy initiatives when he assumes the presidency on 10 December.
To that end we learned that, rather than appointing a single minister for the economy, there will be a team of no less than six ministers responsible for the economy brief.
This historic election reflected the deep divisions in Argentine society, with barely three percentage points ultimately separating Mauricio Macri and the defeated Peronist candidate, Daniel Scioli.
While the victor's well-heeled and middle-class will be expecting a more liberal economic climate, those less well-off working class Argentines who voted for Mr Scioli will also be hoping the new administration protects the welfare programmes introduced by the Fernandez de Kirchner government.
Mr Macri indeed promised to be a ""president for all Argentines"", knowing the powerful labour unions and sometimes volatile Peronist youth movements will become restless if economic ""reform"" turns out to mean across-the-board ""cuts"".
There is clearly not much love lost between the man heading into the hot seat and the woman who has governed Argentina in her own unique style for the past eight years, her reputation and legacy damaged by an election result few would have predicted only a couple of months ago.
Without saying so directly, Mr Macri made it abundantly clear that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's combative and sometimes bellicose style had damaged Argentina's image abroad.
Rebuilding relations with neighbours in Latin America and allies further afield, would be another job at the top of his ""to do"" list.
The most interesting of those relationships is with Venezuela.
Its leftist, revolutionary president, Nicolas Maduro has been one of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's closest allies in the region - part of a populist alliance that included Bolivia and Ecuador, (but less so Chile and Brazil with whom the outgoing president has not always been on the closest terms)
Mr Macri is preparing to realign those alliances, hinting that he might seek to suspend Venezuela from the regional trade bloc Mercosur, over its ""lack of democratic transparency"".
Observers noted with some interest that one of the most prominent figures at Sunday night's victory rally was the wife of the jailed Venezuelan opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez.
With legislative elections in Venezuela looming, the result in Argentina could have wider repercussions.
Back on the domestic front, those of us who have spent many hours covering the case of the death of the special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, have been intrigued by Mr Macri's vow to keep the case alive.
Mr Macri again indirectly accused the outgoing administration of trying to wrap up the investigation and conclude that Mr Nisman killed himself - rather than the widespread view in Argentina that he was murdered.
Less clear yet is what will be Mr Macri's stance on social and moral issues, including gay marriage, abortion and the continued pursuit of human rights abuses committed under Argentina's military rule from 1976 to 1983.
At his victory rally, Mauricio Macri danced like a teenager on stage without, apparently, a care in the world.

Doctors, who held the vote after discussing the plans at a meeting on Monday, said the recent decision to withdraw consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services at the hospital for 18 months has left them feeling demeaned.
Dr Richard Lewis, secretary of the Welsh British Medical Association, said that following a number of high-profile resignations at the board two years ago after a damning report on management failings, communications between the board and the wards remained poor.
""The situation in terms of the board's ability to communicate with its frontline staff are as bad if not worse than ever,"" he told BBC Wales.

5092,"Mr Obama asked Congress for the funds after a week of nationwide protests over perceived policing injustices.
Ferguson in Missouri was rocked by riots after a grand jury decided not to charge a white police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man.
Protests spread across the US and a mass walkout was held on Monday.
Students and workers held a lunchtime protest in several cities to highlight the issue.
""This is not a problem just of Ferguson, Missouri. This is a national problem, Mr Obama said. ""But it's a solvable problem.""
The president spoke after a day of meetings with mayors, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials at the White House.
They discussed a programme that currently provides redundant US military tactical gear to local police departments, free of charge.
Mr Obama said he has asked federal agencies for recommendations to ensure the programme is not building a ""militarised culture"" in domestic police forces.
Police in Ferguson, Missouri, were criticised for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in August.
The funds requested by Mr Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments.
Body cameras can provide evidence of encounters between police and civilians, particularly in disputed cases such as the Ferguson shooting.
The president said the stories of discrimination that young people had told him at the White House on Monday ""violate my belief about what America can do"".
He also unveiled a taskforce on modern policing, to be chaired by Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey.
Also on Monday, a commission tasked with making recommendations on issues stemming from the fatal shooting has convened in Ferguson.
The 16-member panel, stood up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, will consider changes in areas including public interaction with law enforcement and community stability.
The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend.
The decision not to charge Mr Wilson days earlier triggered a nationwide debate over relations between black communities and law enforcement.
The policeman said he had feared for his life.
Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up.","US President Barack Obama has requested $263m (Â£167m) to improve police training, pay for body cameras and restore trust in policing.",30281735,xsum,"US President Barack Obama has requested $263m from Congress for policing reform amid protests over policing injustices following the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson earlier this year.

By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent
The smiles said it all. Jing Haipeng, commander of the Shenzhou-9 crew, was the first to emerge from the return capsule, followed by his flight engineers Liu Wang and the country's first woman astronaut, Liu Yang.
The Shenzhou-9 mission posted a series of firsts: the first manned automatic and manual dockings; the first long-duration spaceflight; and the first crew to live aboard a permanently orbiting module, Tiangong-1.
Beijing has long talked about its three-step strategy.
The first step was the development of the Shenzhou capsule system itself, the second involved the technologies needed for spacewalking and docking, and the third is China's own space station.
But a word of caution. Spaceflight, to quote the old cliche, is hard, and at some point the Chinese programme will encounter problems.
The history of spaceflight tells us unfortunately that some adversity is inevitable. It will be interesting then to see how the Beijing authorities react.
Jonathan Amos' full analysis
""This is another outstanding contribution by the Chinese people to humanity's efforts to explore and use space,"" Mr Wen said in Beijing.
""It feels so good to stand on Earth, and it feels even better to be home,"" astronaut Liu Wang was quoted by national broadcaster CCTV as saying.
""Tiangong-1, our home in space, was comfortable and pleasant. We're very proud of our nation,"" female astronaut Liu Yang said.
The crew of the Shenzhou-9 craft successfully carried out the country's manual docking manoeuvre earlier in the week.
The delicate procedure, which involved bringing together two orbiting vessels travelling at thousands of miles an hour, was mastered by the USSR and US space teams in the 1960s.
The crew also carried out automatic docking of the two crafts during their mission.
The three astronauts returned to the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft on Thursday and performed a manual separation from the space laboratory.
They touched down in Inner Mongolia's Siziwang county, with the capsule deploying a parachute to slow its approach.
All the astronauts were in good health, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. They were shown on CCTV leaving the capsule carried on chairs, smiling as they waved to supporters.
The crew included Jing Haipeng, 45, the mission commander and a veteran astronaut, Liu Yang, 33, and Liu Wang, 43, who performed the manual docking.
Ms Liu, 33, is a major in China's air force from the central province of Henan. On China's Tencent QQ messaging service, she goes by the name ""little Flying Knight"".

The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States.
Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers.
A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force.

Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended.
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago.

He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle.
The gunmen ""were criminals; they weren't protesters,"" he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras.

Belgium's Pieters hit a 68, while American Fowler shot a day's best 67.
Rory McIlroy (73) is one over as he seeks a career Grand Slam but defending champion Danny Willett missed the cut.
Englishman Willett ended one over the cut line on seven over after shooting 78 in blustery winds that made conditions tricky at the Georgia course, although most players did find scoring easier than on the opening day.
Only two players - Hoffman and compatriot William McGirt - shot under 70 on Thursday, but seven men managed the same feat  in the second round - including Garcia, Fowler and Pieters.
""I felt like I played great, I felt like I hit the ball better than the first day,"" said Garcia, the world number 11.
""The course is still very difficult, and I made a couple of stupid mistakes but I can be happy because of the way the course is playing,"" he added.
Garcia has been one of the game's leading players since bursting onto the European Tour scene as a teenager, consistently hovering in and around the world's top 10 and challenging for leading honours.
But his failure to win one of the four majors, after several near misses in 22 top-10 finishes, is a blemish on an otherwise stellar career.
Two impressive rounds at a blustery Augusta have left him well-placed to shake off the unwanted tag of being one of golf's most famous 'nearly men'.
Garcia made a flying start to his second round with birdies on the first three holes before dropping his first shot of the tournament on the fourth.
Then came total confusion after a mistake on the Masters scoring system.
Garcia scored a bogey on the par-four 10th, but it was changed on the scoring system to a triple-bogey seven - dropping him down the leaderboard.
The mistake was eventually rectified by tournament officials about an hour later, moving him back into tied second and two behind Hoffman.
Two more birdies at the 15th and 17th wiped out Hoffman's lead, although the Ryder Cup stalwart missed a six-foot birdie putt on the last to take the outright clubhouse lead.
""I've shown myself many times that I can contend and I truly feel I can not only win one major, but more than one,"" said Garcia.
On the scorecard mix-up, he added: ""I saw it on the leaderboard on the 13th but the main thing was I knew where I stood.""
Hoffman, 40, caused a shock when he shot a stunning seven-under 65 to lead on Thursday but, unsurprisingly, the Californian was unable to replicate this remarkable feat.
His round was ruined by five bogeys in six holes around the turn, although he recovered to birdie the 13th and stay in the hunt.
""Any time this place firms up, it plays its hardest just because it's hard to control your golf ball,"" said Hoffman, who has only previously claimed one top-25 finish at a major.
Belgium's Pieters - considered one of the rising stars on the European Tour - moved into contention with another impressive showing on his Augusta debut.
The 25-year-old began the day level and, after bogeying the first, stormed back with three birdies and an eagle on the 15th.

Fowler, two groups behind Pieters, set the tone by holing his bunker shot for an eagle on the par-five second and adding a birdie on the next. He rolled in three more birdies to record the day's lowest round.
Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth birdied three of his last six holes to finish level par alongside two other former Masters champions, Adam Scott and Phil Mickelson.
In three appearances at the Masters, American Spieth has finished second, first, tied for second.
World number two McIlroy, 27, is aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors - at his third time of trying at Augusta.

He shot a scrappy level-par 72 on Thursday and followed up with a similarly-scruffy round on Friday.
He struggled to find rhythm in a card littered with five bogeys, salvaging four birdies to keep him within touching distance.
However, McIlroy felt aggrieved to walk off the 18th with a bogey after his approach shot hit the flagstick and bounced off the green.
""The shot at the last looked like a tap-in birdie and I made five. I got two bad breaks with hitting the pin and the wind then caught me out on the putt as well,"" he said.
""It was another day where you had to battle, make a lot of pars and pick off the odd birdie here and there.
""I feel I can put a 31 or 32 together a couple of times over the weekend and get closer to the leaders.
""Hopefully these are the toughest conditions we have played in and hopefully I can go a lot lower over the weekend.""
England's Danny Willett became the first Briton to win the Masters in 20 years when he claimed his first major 12 months ago - this time there was no cause to celebrate ending another barren run.
The Yorkshireman, 29, is the first defending champion to miss the cut since Canada's Mike Weir in 2004.
Willett began the day at one over par, but his second round got off to a shocking start when he recorded a quadruple-bogey eight on the first.
Two more bogeys arrived at the fourth and 11th holes, in addition to a solitary birdie at the 10th, leaving him perilously close to missing the projected cut of six over.
And a bogey on the 18th pushed him to seven over par.
""We've had two fabulous years and then you have a little bit of a downturn and it feels like the world is coming to an end,"" Willett said.
""Playing Augusta at the weekend would be nice with the good weather coming in, but we had that in our own hands and unfortunately we let that slip.""
Other big names who missed the cut include reigning Open champion Henrik Stenson, plus former Masters winners Bubba Watson and Zach Johnson.
Seven other Britons - Chris Wood, Tommy Fleetwood, Russell Knox, Ian Woosnam, Tyrrell Hatton, Sandy Lyle and amateur Scott Gregory, plus Ireland's Shane Lowry - also failed to make the weekend.

6468,"Seagrass was deemed to be heading for extinction in this region before the otters returned.
But scientists found that the animals triggered a chain reaction of events that boosted the water-dwelling plants.
The research is published in the journal, PNAS.
The urbanisation of California has led to a huge increase in nutrient pollution in coastal waters, from increasing use of nitrogen-rich fertilizers.
This is said to be the reason for the dieback of seagrass, which has also been declining worldwide.
This research suggests that the hunting to near-extinction of sea otters in the late 19th and early 20th Century may have exacerbated the problem, and conversely that their reintroduction is helping revive ailing seagrass populations, even in the face of hugely nutrient-rich water.
The researchers assessed seagrass levels over the past 50 years in the Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay, and mapped their increases and declines.
They looked at a variety of changes that may have affected the grass, but the only factor that really matched the changes in seagrass was sea otter numbers.
They theorised that sea otters were eating the crabs which prey upon small invertebrates in the water.
These invertebrates eat a type of algae which blooms when there are more nutrients in the soil. It grows on the leaves of the seagrass, shading them from sunlight and causing them to die back.
This is quite a complex cascade of effects, so the researchers tested out their theory by comparing similar estuaries with and without sea otters, and by doing experiments in the lab, and in the field.
These experiments, which included putting cages that sea otters either could or couldn't access, down on the seagrass, confirmed their hypothesis.
Brent Hughes, lead author of the study, said: ""This estuary is part of one of the most polluted systems in the entire world, but you can still get this healthy thriving habitat, and it's all because of the sea otters.
""So it's almost like these sea otters are fighting the effects of poor water quality.""
Hughes described seagrass as ""the canary in the coalmine"" in terms of predicting levels of nutrient pollution in the water.
It also acts as a nursery habitat for many species of fish and it uses CO2 from sea water and the atmosphere, thus potentially helping with climate change.
Not only that, but it acts as protection to the stability of the shoreline.
Hughes said: ""It's what we call a foundation species, like kelp forest, salt marsh or coral reef. The major problem from a global perspective is that seagrass is declining worldwide. And one of the major drivers of this decline has been nutrient inputs from anthropogenic sources, via agriculture or urban runoff.""
These findings are of particular interest at the moment, as a ban on sea otters moving along the coast to southern California was lifted last year. The ban was in place as there was a fear the sea otters would impinge on fisheries in the area.
Hughes told BBC news: ""That's important because there's a lot of these kind of degraded estuaries in southern California because of all the urban runoff from places like Los Angeles and San Diego.
""Coastal managers will now have a better sense of what's going to happen when sea otters move in to their systems.
""There's a huge potential benefit to sea otters returning to these estuaries, and in to these seagrass beds that might be threatened.""","The return of sea otters to an estuary on the central Californian coast has significantly improved the health of seagrass, new research has found.",23814524,xsum,"Research published in the journal PNAS shows that sea otters have a highly positive impact on the health of seagrass. Scientists found that increasing numbers of sea otters, which eat crabs that prey on small invertebrates in the water, act to increase the invertebrates which in turn eat the algae that causes seagrass to die back. The sea otters were reintroduced to Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay after hunting had almost made them extinct. The introduction has resulted in significantly healthier seagrass populations, according to the study.","Sea otters are helping to revive seagrass populations, according to research published in the journal PNAS. Increasing use of nitrogen-rich fertilisers has harmed coastal waters in California, leading to a decline in seagrass levels. This research found that the reintroduction of sea otters has boosted the growth of seagrass populations by acting as a predator for crabs that prey on small invertebrates. Those invertebrates eat algae which grow more plentifully in nutrient-rich environments and subsequently bloom, shading seagrass leaves and causing them to die back. Seagrass is important to the marine ecosystem as a nursery for many fish species and for its potential as a way of reducing carbon dioxide levels."

6776,"Rocket Lab's 17m-long (56ft) Electron lifted off from the Mahia Peninsula, in the North Island, the firm said.
The test flight was the first launch from New Zealand and is a major first step in an emerging market: launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads.
The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year.
Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10-day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16:20 local time (04:20 GMT).
The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted, but the company released a video of the lift-off on its Twitter page.
""It was a great flight,"" chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch, adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit, the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth.
""We'll be investigating why, however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme, deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business.""
The test launch, one of three planned, did not carry a payload as such, although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed.
Eventually, Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg (331lbs) into a 500km-high orbits that go from pole to pole.
We're on the cusp of something quite exciting. Innovative companies are packaging really capable technologies into very small, low-cost satellites.
Their data will drive myriad new services - from helping city officials keep track of urban development to giving farmers information about the performance of their crops. But if this new wave is to succeed it needs cheaper access to space.
At the moment, the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket.
Rocket Lab aims to change that. And there others, such as Richard Branson's LauncherOne project. Rocket Lab's second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple months.
Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US/NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon.
Rocket Lab's founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary.
The country has less air traffic, compared to say the US, so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space.
New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north-to-south orbit around Earth.
The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water, far from from people and property.
The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low-cost space hub.
Nice touch: The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage. They are called Rutherford engines - after the great New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937), who famously split the atom in 1917.
Private and commercial rocket launches are becoming more and more common - the most famous example being Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon rockets.
But the SpaceX vehicles are huge and are aimed at following in the footsteps of Nasa missions, delivering cargo to the international space station and eventually sending people to Mars.
Rocket Lab's goal is to launch what, by comparison, is a tiny rocket for a fraction of the price, but with much more frequency.
The Electron is a mere 17m long and 1.2m in diameter. Each launch only costs about $5m. Rocket Lab wants to conduct 50 or more a year.
Just to put this all into perspective: SpaceX's current Falcon rocket is a towering 70m and can carry 22,800kg into low-Earth orbit for a standard price of $62m.
Rocket Lab's website already allows you to book a slot for your satellite. The cheapest deal is a small cubesat on a rideshare option - prices start at $77,000 (Â£59,280).","An American company has launched a rocket into space from New Zealand, the first from a private launch facility.",39971843,xsum,"Rocket Lab has launched its first-ever rocket, Electron, from Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, with plans to launch more than 50 of the disposable rockets per year.

Each Electron launch expected to cost about $5m, with the mission set to offer far cheaper access to space for those using their services, including city planners monitoring urban development, and farmers assessing crop quality.","Small rocket manufacturer Rocket Lab conducted a successful test launch of its Electron rocket from New Zealand, a significant moment in the push to create a market for low-cost, disposable launch vehicles that can carry payloads of small satellites.

It comes after a lawyer for an event organiser accused the UMP of ordering almost 11m euros ($15m; Â£9m) worth of fake invoices to cover overspends.
Reports say the scandal could damage the party and complicate any efforts by Mr Sarkozy to be re-elected.
Police searched the headquarters of the UMP in Paris on Monday afternoon.

""There was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and I was probably one of them,"" he said.
He said Mr Sarkozy, UMP Chairman Jean-Francois Cope and Batien Millot, the founder of the events company Bygmalion, were not aware of the actions taken.
It comes after Patrick Maisonneuve, the lawyer for Bygmalion, told the same television station that the centre-right UMP had ordered fake invoices to cover exploding campaign costs.
He said it was made clear to Bygmalion that if it did not comply, it would not be paid.
The UMP's chairman was already facing growing speculation that he will have to step down after the French newspaper Liberation reported this month that the party paid some 20m euros to a unit of Bygmalion, founded by two associates of Mr Cope, to organise campaign events.
Mr Cope told BMF TV earlier on Monday that he knew nothing of any wrongdoing.
He said he had put his trust in the people who were responsible for the party's accounts and did not think he had to look over their shoulders.
Mr Cope was already expected to face challenges for the leadership of the party after the UMP's poor result in the European Parliament elections. It came second to the far-right Front National.

The claims could threaten the reputation of Sarkozy and his planned return to politics. The investigation could also impact potential leaders of the UMP. Jean-Francois Cope, the current chairman of UMP, was already facing calls to step down following the party's poor European Parliament election results when the scandal broke.","Jerome Lavrilleux, a deputy director of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign, has admitted on France's BFM TV that his party, the UMP, exceeded campaign spending limits through false billing that was charged to the party rather than to Sarkozy's unsuccessful re-election bid.

Nora Aunor, 59, was named best actress for Thy Womb, while 87-year-old Eddie Garcia was named best actor for Bwakaw.
Garcia, who said he was ""elated and honoured"" to be recognised, also received the People's Choice award for favourite actor.

Speaking to reporters ahead of the ceremony, Yeoh revealed she had long heard rumours of a Crouching Tiger sequel but had yet to see a script.
'Very privileged'
Recent reports have attached martial arts star Donnie Yen to the project, and Yeoh said she would welcome the opportunity to work with him if a sequel was made.
Yeoh appeared in the 1997 James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies and was recently seen playing the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi in film biopic The Lady.

5954,"Asad Khan, from Bradford, who died in September was a pupil at the city's Beckfoot Upper Heaton School. His family believe he had been bullied.
An inquest into his death was adjourned on Monday when the claims emerged.
The family's solicitor Ruth Bundey said it was important to have time to review the evidence.
Speaking after the adjournment at Bradford Coroner's Court, she added: ""We have always considered the death of an 11-year-old boy by self-suspension, a boy who had no mental health background, as being completely inexplicable.
""We now find out, only this morning, that a police sergeant involved in the investigation spoke to a school manager in January.""
Ms Bundey said the new evidence could explain why many of those questioned ""were very reluctant to come anywhere near the inquest"".
The solicitor also said the evidence raised concerns about ""the school's duty of care if such a dangerous practice was known to the kids"".
She added it was important that the evidence be reviewed in order to help prevent future deaths.
A statement from the school said: ""We are very sorry that the inquest has been adjourned. No words can adequately describe the sense of loss that we know Asad's family feel and any delay in the inquest process is regrettable.
""The school has made a series of statements to police in relation to their investigation and we believe they will be thoroughly examined when the inquest resumes. Further comment at this stage would be inappropriate.""
West Yorkshire Police said it had provided all available evidence for the purpose of the inquest.

10825,"The serious case review into events at Winterbourne View, near Bristol, comes after 11 ex-staff members admitted offences against patients.
Owners Castlebeck took ""financial reward without the responsibility"", the report's author Margaret Flynn said.
South Gloucestershire Council said it ""fully accepted"" the findings.
Castlebeck said the criticisms in the report were being ""actively addressed"".
The independent report also revealed concerns were raised before the abuse was uncovered in a secretly-filmed investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme.
The safety of dozens of patients was raised but the NHS was only informed about a handful of cases.
From the opening of the hospital in 2006 until 2011, there were 38 safeguarding alerts raised about 20 patients from the unit. Only one in five of those was reported to the NHS.
Three alerts the NHS does not appear to have been notified of in any way - an allegation of abuse by staff, concerns about the attitude of some staff, and an allegation of assault by a member of staff.
Peter Murphy, the head of South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board, said he wanted to convey his ""deep regret"" for what had happened at the hospital.
""In particular, I would like to express our regret to the hospital's patients and to their families, friends and carers,"" he said.
""Winterbourne View hospital should have been a safe place for them to be treated with care and compassion.
""But the hospital's owners, Castlebeck Care Ltd, failed to provide that care.""
Margaret Flynn, the report's author, said Castlebeck had ""promoted an unworkable management structure"" and relied on ""poorly paid and untrained staff"".
She added the firm did not ""act on the concerns, complaints of Winterbourne View visitors or patients"".
The Panorama programme, aired in May last year, showed ""compelling images"" of patients being slapped and restrained under chairs, having their hair pulled, and being held down as medication was forced into their mouths, Ms Flynn said.
By Matthew HillBBC West health correspondent
With the increasing use of the private sector delivering care to  patients, Winterbourne View raises fundamental questions about whether their safeguards are as robust as the NHS.
It's emerged from the serious case review that unlike NHS hospitals, private institutions like Winterbourne have no electronic system to report so-called 'Serious Untoward Incidents'.
Even on the rare occasions when primary care trusts were told about these concerns by social or health workers, they were not reported to the body charged with spotting patterns of abuse - the Strategic Health Authority.
If they had been, then the scandal  could have been revealed before the BBC filmed undercover.
It remains to be seen whether the Department of Health will address this question, when they give their report into Winterbourne View.
She said patients had been ""traumatised and remain very distressed that they were not believed"".
But she was also critical of ""out of sight, out of mind"" commissioning by primary care trusts when placing patients in Winterbourne View.
Castlebeck, the report added, ""appears to have made decisions about profitability, including shareholder returns, over and above decisions about the the effective and humane delivery of assessment, treatment and rehabilitation"".
The average weekly fee per patient was Â£3,500, but Castlebeck did not tell the review how this was spent.
Ms Flynn said the turnover at Winterbourne View alone was Â£3.7m a year.
She said the staff were ""chronically bored"" in their roles at the hospital, which was ""poorly managed"".
A spokesman for Castlebeck said: ""We hope that the lessons learned and the actions that flow from this rigorous report will mark the start of a new chapter for care in our sector.
""The actions towards people with learning disabilities by former members of staff at Winterbourne View Hospital were both wholly unacceptable and deeply distressing for all concerned and we are truly sorry this happened in one of our services.""
He said significant changes had been made within their organisation that included extensive changes to board membership, all new operations structures, strengthened clinical governance and increased staff training and development.
""Importantly, we are determined to ensure that each of the persons for whom we care and their family are firmly at the heart of everything we do,"" he said.
Avon and Somerset Police were also criticised for not informing South Gloucestershire Adult Safeguarding of all their contacts with the hospital.
Det Ch Supt Louisa Rolfe, head of CID at the force, said there were 29 calls and nine incidents over a period of nearly three years relating to Winterbourne View, and agreed a pattern should have been noticed.
She said investigating officers had ""overly relied on people perceived as professionals and experts in their field"" at the hospital, for information.
David Behan, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, said: ""There is much for all the organisations involved with Winterbourne View to consider in Margaret Flynn's thorough and comprehensive report.
""I will ensure that the Care Quality Commission responds fully to all the recommendations for CQC.
""We will continue to work with other organisations to improve communications and sharing information to ensure we all protect those who are most vulnerable.""
Dr Gabriel Scally, who chaired the NHS review panel, said: ""The most striking thing - apart from the sheer horror of what was done to patients - is that even though lots of different people knew bits of what was going on, nobody put it all together and did anything about it.
""That is most disturbing.
""We should take this opportunity to look at reporting systems and make sure a system is in place so when incidents happen they are properly reported and investigated.""
Anne Milton, parliamentary under-secretary of state for public health, said primary care trusts had spent money ""recklessly"" putting patients in Winterbourne View.
She said changes were being made to make it the responsibility of those commissioning care to ensure quality is a priority.
The report was published as two organisations warned that moving people hundreds of miles away from their families increased the risk of abuse taking place.
Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation said they had received 260 reports from families concerning abuse and neglect in institutional care since the Panorama programme was broadcast.
Eleven former workers at the private hospital have pleaded guilty to almost 40 charges of abuse and are due to be sentenced later at Bristol Crown Court.","Fundamental changes are needed in how care of vulnerable adults is commissioned and monitored, a report into abuse at a private hospital said.",19162516,xsum,"An independent report has found that owners of the Winterbourne View care home in South Gloucestershire took “financial reward without the responsibility” leading to the abuse of patients.

The Panorama documentary programme that exposed the abuse at the home was aired in May 2011. Subsequently, 11 former workers at the home pleaded guilty to almost 40 charges of abuse. Relatives of patients who suffered at the home are calling for a public inquiry into the scandal.

The report raises fundamental questions about the safeguards of privately-owned institutions delivering care to vulnerable people.

9322,"A second bus was hit by a suicide bomber elsewhere in the city, injuring two soldiers and two civilians.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attacks.
The blasts come a day after Afghan and US officials signed a deal letting US troops stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014.
The agreement was authorised by new Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, who was sworn in on Monday.
On that same day, two bombs killed at least 15 people in Kabul and Paktia provinces.
Mr Ghani's predecessor, Hamid Karzai, had refused to sign the deal because of a disagreement with the US.
The attack on the army bus took place in western Kabul, and largely destroyed the bus.
""I was walking down the road when a huge explosion occurred,"" shopkeeper Sanaullah Khan told Reuters.
""Right after the blast, I saw dust and smoke rising from the area and then I escaped.""
The second attack took place in northeast Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for both attacks on Twitter, saying they were a continuation of an offensive which started in the summer.

The belt could only be won by Yafai after the Panamanian was stripped of it when he failed to make the weight.
Unbeaten in 21 professional fights, Yafai previously held the Commonwealth and British super-flyweight belts.
The Birmingham fighter also won a silver medal at the 2010 European Championships during his amateur career.
""It's unbelievable, it's going to take a while to sink in,"" he said. ""I knew I was going to do it, it was just a matter of how. I just did what I needed to do.
""I can't wait to headline in Birmingham as a world champion. My hands are a bit sore so I might be out for a little bit, but the second I can get in the gym I will be back working and getting ready to defend this belt.""
The fight was part of a packed undercard as Britain's Anthony Joshua retained his IBF world heavyweight championship by knocking out American Eric Molina.
Bury's Scott Quigg won his first fight since losing to Carl Frampton in February, and his first as a featherweight, outpointing Mexico's Jose Cayetano.
Former super-bantamweight world champion Quigg, 28, had his jaw broken by Frampton but showed no signs of frailty on his return to the ring.
Cayetano, himself fighting at 126lb for the first time, was unmoved by most of his opponent's punches until the end of the eighth round, when he began to wilt.
And Quigg finished his rival off with a flashing left-right combination at close quarters, the referee calling a halt to proceedings with Cayetano on the deck.
Quigg has plenty of options at featherweight. Frampton moved up and claimed the WBA featherweight title in July, Welshman Lee Selby is the IBF title-holder and Leeds' Josh Warrington is also in the hunt for a world title.
Liverpool's Callum Smith stayed on course for a world title shot with a brutal 10th-round knockout of game Lancastrian Luke Blackledge.
Referee Steve Gray could have stopped the fight earlier but allowed the one-sided battering to continue until Blackledge was knocked unconscious.
There were an anxious few minutes as a prone Blackledge was administered oxygen before he gingerly, and mercifully, made it back to his feet.
Smith, 26, successfully defended his British title for the first time and remained unbeaten in 22 pro fights, with 17 knockouts.
He is ranked number one by the WBC but Sweden's Badou Jack is defending that belt against Britain's IBF champion James DeGale in January.
In a thrilling light-heavyweight contest, Frank Buglioni stopped Hosea Burton in the 12th and final round to secure the British title.
Manchester's Burton, 28, built an early lead behind his jab and some ramrod right hands, and the challenger's face was a bloody mess by the middle rounds.
However, the Londoner's punches started to have an effect down the stretch and Burton went down under a barrage in the 11th.
Midway through the 12th, Burton was stunned by a right to the temple before going down again. He clambered to his feet but the referee called things off after another assault by Buglioni, with a minute and four seconds remaining.
Buglioni, 27, improves to 19 wins (15 KOs) and two defeats from 22 pro fights and could be rewarded with a second shot at a world title.
Welterweight Conor Benn, son of British legend Nigel, made it six wins out of six with a first-round knockout of Manchester's Steven Backhouse.

3767,"Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said his mother Peggy was ""traumatised"" to learn the truth.
He was talking to BBC journalist Peter Taylor for a TV documentary to be broadcast on Monday, 29 September.
The former IRA commander from Londonderry joined the IRA in 1970, shortly after the Troubles began.
He said he had not told his parents about his membership of the paramilitary organisation.
""My mother found, I think it was a black beret or something like that, in the house and it immediately traumatised her, I think,"" he said.
His mother, Peggy McGuinness, died in 2008 aged 84.
Looking back on the moment when she found out, he said:  ""She did not hit me with it or anything like that or if there were gloves, there was no smack across the face with the gloves.
""I think that it was a moment in time and she was obviously annoyed at the prospect that all of our lives were changing and maybe mine more dramatically than anybody else's.""
On 30 January 1972, the Army shot dead 13 innocent civil rights protesters in Derry on Bloody Sunday.
Martin McGuinness was second in command in the IRA at that time. He later addressed the Saville Inquiry, set up to establish why those people were killed.
The inquiry found that Mr McGuinness was present at the time of the violence and ""probably armed with a sub-machine gun"" but did not engage in ""any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire"".
He rose to become a senior figure in the IRA and Sinn FÃ©in and was involved in negotiations with the government that led to paramilitary ceasefires and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
In June 2012, he shook hands with the Queen on her visit to Northern Ireland - a photograph that became a symbol of reconciliation.
Earlier this year, Mr McGuinness attended a Windsor Castle banquet hosted by the Queen marking the state visit to Britain of Irish President Michael D Higgins.
The deputy first minister has also called for a border poll in Northern Ireland on unification with the Republic of Ireland and said he was fighting politically for reunification.
In recent years, Mr McGuinness has insisted his job had become a political one.

5395,"Accies travel to Ibrox for what will be Caixinha's first game in charge.
""It changes slightly because it is a little bit unknown how he best thinks to set up the players he's got,"" said player-manager Canning.
""If he comes in and does a good job and it is something you can learn from as a young manager then great.""
Caixinha took over on Monday, the day after Rangers recorded a creditable 1-1 draw away to city rivals and Premiership leaders Celtic in Graeme Murty's last game as caretaker manager.
Canning thought it would be ""good for the game"" in Scotland if the 46-year-old Portuguese proved to be the standard of coach that could improve Rangers.
But he is hoping he can outfox the former Santos Laguna and Al-Gharafa boss when his side visit Ibrox.
""I don't know much about him, but I've checked back at his previous clubs to see how he's played, but that is dependent on the players he's got,"" said Canning.
""I think he will come in and want to put his own stamp on it straight away.
""I don't think he'll feel the need to stick with what they've been doing.
""He might if he thinks that's the best way to go about it and it mirrors his philosophy and how he wants to play.""
Accies held Rangers to a 1-1 draw in the opening Scottish Premiership game of the season at Ibrox and then suffering a 6-0 beating there in this month's Scottish Cup quarter-final.
""The atmosphere in the stadium will be a little more intense than it would normally be,"" Canning predicted.
""The new guy has come in and the players will be desperate to impress, the fans will want to get behind the team and it will be a very similar atmosphere, I imagine, to the opening day of the season.
""We need to make sure we stand up to that again and we need to do our own job.""
Canning was pleased how his players had handled the occasion at the start of the season - and for much of the cup game despite their heavy defeat.
""Watching back the 6-0 game, for the first 45 minutes we were very good then we concede straight after half-time and four goals in the last 10 minutes,"" he added.

6244,"""And on the Monday there was no one there. There was a complete hush, it was extraordinary,"" says Mr Haynes who used to work on the floor of the London Stock Exchange, and is now chief executive of the trading venue Aquis Exchange.
The Monday he's referring to was 30 years ago. It was the day of the Big Bang - when, in one fell swoop, the City of London was deregulated, revolutionising its fortunes and turning it into a financial capital to rival New York.
London's switch in 1986 from traditional face-to-face share dealing to electronic trading helped it outpace its European competitors and became a magnet for international banks.
Even if London now loses access to the single market, many believe the Big Bang's legacy is a financial infrastructure with foundations too deep to be moved.
But many also say it sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis.
There were three key elements to the Big Bang revolution:
By ending fixed commissions Big Bang allowed more competition; by ending the separation of dealers and advisors it allowed mergers and take-overs; and by allowing in foreign owners it opened London's market to international banks.
Coupled with the new magic of electronic trading - the City jumped from the 19th Century to the threshold of the 21st.
It is generally thought that Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister drove through Big Bang as part of a programme of deregulation, but there were already powerful forces at work.
By the early 1980s the competition authorities were threatening to take the stock exchange to the Restrictive Practices Court.
Nicholas Goodison, then chairman of the Stock Exchange, believed it would be better to pre-empt the lawyers and avoid being forced to tear up its rule book.
In any case the world was already changing. The US had abolished fixed commissions in 1974, and in 1979 the Conservative government abolished exchange controls - triggering for many the UK's financial and economic rebirth.
""And there were other developments,"" says David Buik, now a market commentator at Panmure Gordon.
""You have to remember that LIFFE (the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) had started up in 1982 and already attracted the big American and Japanese banks - not to mention the privatisations of British Gas, British Airways and so on.""
In the end it was Mr Goodison, Trade and Industry Secretary Cecil Parkinson, and Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who persuaded Mrs Thatcher to back the reforms that changed the City for ever.
City traders were then strictly divided into two; jobbers and brokers. Brokers liaised with clients and then gave their orders to jobbers who did the actual trading, face-to-face in ""open outcry"", on the exchange floor.
Up until 1967 trading was done at the old Capel Court exchange, known as The House, where ""waiters"" would water the floors with watering cans to keep down the dust.
Nowadays the pre-Big Bang City has a bowler hat image, where a good lunch and long friendships were more important than profit. But it wasn't all like that, according to Brian Winterflood, later the founder of Winterflood Securities, who had been a jobber at Greener Dreyfus since the 1950s.
""We had lunch but we never stopped trading,"" he said in a 1990 interview. ""If we were too busy for lunch we wouldn't go to lunch, and you'd snatch a half an hour now and again.""
Crucially for the subsequent development of London as an international financial centre, the Big Bang produced a free-for-all, as brokers, jobbers and the City's traditional merchant banks merged.
Some were bought by UK clearing banks but many more were snapped up by much bigger US, European and Japanese banks.
The 300 member firms of the stock exchange had all been domestic - but within a year 75 were foreign-owned. With this came electronic trading, cutting costs as the competition increased. The jobbers vanished and the trading floor became deserted.
All this meant that the volume of trade that flooded through the new terminals soared, averaging more than $7.4bn a week after Big Bang compared with $4.5bn a week beforehand.
And costs also came down.
""When I started out it cost a fortune to trade, the spreads between buying and selling were huge. Now you can trade on your mobile phone for a fiver,"" says Mr Haynes.
It is said that Big Bang created 1,500 millionaires. Some 95% of the firms had been owned by partnerships, and dazzled by the massive sums on offer many sold up and retired.
It also changed the geography of London. Until then the Bank of England had insisted that all of London's banks had to be within 10 minutes' walking distance of the governor's office so, it was said, in a crisis he could summon the lords of finance to his parlour with half an hour's notice.
But the Securities and Investments Board (later the Financial Services Authority) replaced the Bank's regulatory role.
On the day of Big Bang an advertisement in the Financial Times promised a new financial centre, three miles to the east of the City at Canary Wharf, which would ""feel like Venice and work like New York"".
Yet not everything went to plan. In the short term there was a problem of massive overcapacity. The banks found they had overspent.
The following years saw them closing down venerable firms like Vickers da Costa, Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee, Fielding Newson-Smith, Wood Mackenzie; names that now appear only in history books and at the bottom of senior financiers' resumes.
By 1992 Canary Wharf was forced into bankruptcy as it struggled to find tenants.
But in the 1990s and 2000s, profits, salaries and bonuses boomed. Even Canary Wharf recovered and thrived.
The result was a financial sector many believe is Brexit-proof. ""The banks built a huge infrastructure in technology, transport, education and telecoms, and that infrastructure is unique,"" says Mr Haynes.
""People who say we are going to move off to Paris or Frankfurt don't understand you can't build an infrastructure like that overnight. It can't be rebuilt quickly just anywhere in the world.""
But with the wealth came something more ambiguous, and dangerous - a change of attitude.  ""It became much more of a dog-eat-dog environment,"" says David Buik.
""In the old days you would have been very careful to look after your client, you had a relationship. But it became a competition on rate and pricing. And the earnings became colossal.""
Much of this was based around a bonus culture which rewarded the best deal, while short-term trumped long-term.
Some people understood better than others what was happening.
David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit but went on to be a Conservative minister, co-authored a paper for Mrs Thatcher on the likely impact of the Big Bang.
He expressed concern about ""unethical behaviour"" and that financial deregulation could lead to ""boom and bust"" But he concluded while there might be ""individual financial failures"" he did not expect ""a systemic problem"".
On this he was wrong. The 2008 financial collapse was systemic. It prompted a new wave a regulation, trimming some of the City's freedoms.
However, no one, save perhaps the odd elderly broker, dozing now in his Surrey mansion, would dream of returning to the days of bowler hats when the waiters watered the floors in Capel Court.","""I was used to the hustle and bustle, the crowd on the floor,"" says Alasdair Haynes.",37751599,xsum,"The Big Bang of 1986, in which London’s financial markets rose to rival those of New York, laid the groundwork for UK finance to continue attracting international banks, according to advocates. Margaret Thatcher drove the programme of deregulation, removing the separation of advisors and dealers and introducing foreign ownership. Opponents to the change claim that it has been responsible for the country’s boom-and-bust economy, exemplified by the 2008 financial crisis, as businesses prioritised short-term profits over relationships with clients. Nevertheless, supporters point out that London's infrastructure is now so deep-rooted that it is Brexit-proof.","The Big Bang, which deregulated the City of London in 1986 and led to the rise of electronic trading and international investment, is still leaving its mark on global finance today. Despite criticism that it created an uncertain environment where the competition was based on rate and pricing, the legacy of the Big Bang has bequeathed finance with an infrastructure unique to London. Critics who believe that the UK capital will lose its significance post-Brexit do not grasp the time and effort required to replicate or create such an infrastructure, according to some executives interviewed. "

Speaking in Columbus, Ohio, he offered no evidence for his claim, which he repeated later on Fox News. Trump has also been widely criticised for his remarks about Khizr Khan, whose son, a US Muslim soldier, was killed in action, and for suggesting that Clinton was ""the devil"". Last week, he suggested that Ghazala Khan, the soldier's mother, had been prevented from speaking at the Democratic National Convention.

4912,"Imagine a situation where most people with a common condition are undiagnosed and where opportunities are repeatedly missed to identify the problem and to offer good care.
What is this condition? It's dying.
Each year, an estimated 92,000 people in England are believed to need end of life care but not receive it.
As a practising GP I have seen distressed relatives after a patient has died in hospital.
Often they have not had a chance to see their relative before they died and were unaware of the seriousness of the condition, despite repeated admissions with deteriorating conditions.
Many such patients are never formally identified as at risk of dying and not assessed for end of life care.
One relative said something that haunts me to this day: ""I wish the doctors had told me that my mother was dying.""
As a result too many people still die in distress with uncontrolled symptoms, or have futile interventions when this will not make any difference.
All of us, including doctors, must do more to talk about dying.
A new ComRes research for the Dying Matters Coalition confirms there is a widespread reluctance to talk about dying and death.
That is why we want to encourage people to talk more openly about dying and bereavement and to make plans around end-of-life care.
Most people have not made a plan of their choices and wishes in the event of a serious illness.
People often think there is plenty of time when the situation arises but often this is not the case and it can be too late.
Doctors are trained to cure, but as people live with long-term conditions, the medical profession needs to change how it works with dying patients.
We need to bring dying back into people's homes, rather than in hospital, care homes or hospices.
As increasing numbers of people develop and live with dementia, it is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care people would choose, while people are healthy.
There's a huge change required in our culture, starting with the medical profession.
Having learnt a lot from the Canadian communications expert Prof Stephen Workman, I would urge doctors to do three things.
First, be compassionate but direct when talking about dying.
Doctors speaking to relatives about an ill patient who is giving cause for concern, should not just say ""your husband is seriously ill"", but should add ""It is possible that he could die"". This allows all involved to prepare.
Secondly, be honest and don't offer false hope.
Think twice about offering a false choice of procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when someone is actually dying and chances of recovery are minuscule.
Instead offer supportive care to keep the patient comfortable and allow them to die a natural dignified death.
And, thirdly, when doctors diagnose a serious illness they should ask the patient whether they would like to talk about what they can expect and what is likely to happen.
Most people die from frailty in old age, and will be well known to health and social care services.
Importantly, this gives opportunities for talking about end of life wishes and advance care planning.
My ambition is to reduce the fear of dying and increase knowledge and awareness of palliative care.
It is vitally important that every person who is coming to the end of their life is spotted early enough and supported to make a good advance care plan.
I know just how hard it is to address issues like this in the frenzy of busy surgeries and wards.
But we as doctors need to up our game.
All of us, especially doctors can play a part in ensuring everyone is able to have a good death.","In this week's Scrubbing Up opinion column, Prof Mayur Lakhani chair of the Dying Matters Coalition, urges doctors to be more open and frank about preparing patients and their families for the end of life.",18101418,xsum,"A recent ComRes survey conducted for the Dying Matters Coalition, reveals that most people in England are reluctant and do not want to discuss death and dying, even though they may have relatives or friends who are terminally ill.

It is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care that people would choose, while they are still healthy.

2681,"The accusation comes days after the US and Taiwan said China appeared to have deployed surface-to-air missiles on a contested island in the region.
Vietnam has called the reported move a ""serious violation"". The Philippines and Australia also expressed concern.
China dismissed the reports as ""hype"", but said it had the right under international law to defend itself.
Several nations claim territory in the resource-rich South China Sea, which is also an important shipping route.
Taiwan and US officials say satellite images taken on 14 February indicate that China has deployed missiles on Woody or Yongxing Island in the Paracels.
The island is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.
US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday: ""There is every evidence, every day, that there has been an increase of militarisation from one kind or another. It's a serious concern.""
However, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei hit back on Friday, telling reporters that US air and naval patrols in the region were what had ""escalated tensions"" in the region.
""That's the real militarisation of the South China Sea,"" he added.
The US says it does not take sides on territorial disputes, but has previously sent B-52 bombers and a naval destroyer near the disputed islands.
It says it conducts such ""freedom of navigation"" operations to ensure access to key shipping and air routes.
On Friday, Vietnam said it had issued diplomatic notes to the UN Secretary General and the Chinese embassy to protest against China's apparent deployment of missiles on Woody Island.

2824,"Josh Earnest said the closure of the Cuban detention camp was a national security interest.
It was one of the first directives President Barack Obama ordered two months after he was elected in 2008.
Inmates have slowly been transferred out and at the start of the year, 122 men were left.
The peak population in 2003 was 684.
Mr Earnest said the administration was ""in the final stages of drafting a plan to safely and responsibly (close) the prison at Guantanamo Bay and to present that to Congress"".
He added: ""That has been something that our national security officials have been working on for quite some time, primarily because it is a priority of the president.""
In 2009, President Obama admitted the January 2010 deadline he had set for closing the counter-terrorism facility would be missed.
Since then, Congress bipartisan opposition has meant the transfer of prisoners to the US has been blocked.
Some have been considered too dangerous to be released, but the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them.
The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, a process Mr Earnest said needs to continue if the facility is to shut.
The camp was established in 2002 by the Bush administration to detain the most dangerous suspects for interrogation and the prosecution of war crimes.
Controversy has centred around the period of time detainees have been held without charge and the use of interrogation techniques.","The White House is in the ""final stages"" of drafting a plan to close the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay, a spokesman has said.",33626398,xsum,"The White House said that it is ""in the final stages of drafting a plan"" to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay; President Obama has long argued that the prison is ""contrary to American values"" with its detention of individuals without trial and use of torture. His spokesman, Josh Earnest, has said that closure of the Cuban detention camp is a national security interest; however, one major drawback to the plan is that prisoners who are considered to be too dangerous cannot be released as there is no evidence that can be used against them in civilian or military trials. Given that Congress has been blocking the transfer of these prisoners to the US, the White House is left with few options other than returning prisoners to their home countries or third-party countries.","The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, has announced that the administration is working on a plan to close Guantanamo Bay, and will present this to Congress once completed. The prison camp was established by the Bush administration in 2002, with the aim of detaining the most dangerous terror suspects for interrogation and war crimes prosecution. President Obama tried to close the detention centre shortly after his election in 2008 but has been prevented from doing so because of congressional opposition to bringing detainees to US soil. Only 122 men remain at the camp, compared to a peak population of 684 in 2003. The US has slowly been sending prisoners back to their home countries or to third countries, and this process needs to continue. Among other criticisms of Guantanamo, the international community has raised concerns about prisoners being held in the camp for lengthy periods without being charged, and the use of interrogation techniques."
8657,"There are currently five drop-in clinics in England for victims of the practice, which affects an estimated 200 million women and girls worldwide.
But there is no such medical provision in Wales.
Now charity Bawso is working to open a pilot clinic at the Cardiff Royal Infirmary to provide medical and psychological help to survivors.

Bawso's violence against women director Dr Mwenya Chima said: ""In the UK there are women's clinics for women who have had FGM, for medical and psychological help. Survivors can just walk in and ask for help.
""But in Wales we don't have any of that. We are trying to make a case to health agencies that we need to have this kind of clinic, even if it is initially for one day a week for a year to see if there is a demand.""
Dr Chima believes there is a big gap in the support provided, and that many survivors of FGM in Wales are not known about.
She said: ""I worked with a young women recently - a survivor of FGM - who wanted medical help as she was having problems. Although she wanted help she was already in two minds about having anything done as she was going against her parents.
""We tried to get her help from the clinic in Bristol, but there were delays because she was outside the area, so in the end it didn't happen and she is still living with these problems now.""

1816,"The Portuguese defender's quick-fire brace put the Bees in control at Brisbane Road before Curtis Weston sealed the points in added time after Paul McCallum had halved the deficit.
Santos, a recent signing from Peterborough, seized on a fumble by O's goalkeeper Alex Cisak to break the deadlock from close range in the 63rd minute and he doubled the advantage three minutes later following good work from Nana Kyei.
McCallum gave the O's a lifeline when he powerfully headed in a Callum Kennedy corner with 10 minutes remaining but Weston guaranteed the three points when he crashed the ball into an empty net after a lob from substitute Jamal Campbell-Ryce rebounded off the crossbar.
Although the teams went into the interval all-square, the visitors should have been well ahead having missed five clear chances, and leading scorer John Akinde was the main culprit for their profligacy.
His best chance came after just four minutes when he stabbed wide from close range with the goal at his mercy.
Fellow striker Simeon Akinola spurned two straight-forward chances set up by Akinde as the home side struggled to contain the Bees' attacking threat.

4348,"As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday.
Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened.
He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success.
Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was ""not good"", that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal.
A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers ""unconvincing"".
In 2014 a company was awarded a £39m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present.
No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts.
As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017.
During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built.
""We are in on going discussions with the operator on that,"" said Mr Roberts.
Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a ""commercial matter"".
Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm ""pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment"".
Mr Roberts replied with a denial: ""No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all.""
""At the time, there was no market for larch,"" he said, claiming timber merchants at the time ""would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch"".
""What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market.""
Mr Roberts said there was a ""real crisis on our hands at the time"" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse.
""The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful,"" he said.
""It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well.""
A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent.
In a qualification to the body's accounts he said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful.
NRW disputed the auditor's findings on state aid and had said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful.
Neither NRW or the auditors have identified the company involved.
Following the meeting Mr Waters said the answers given by the chief executive ""were not satisfactory"" and that the evidence was ""unconvincing"".
He said it was a ""serious issue which has been badly handled"". Mr Waters said it was clear from the evidence ""with two days to go before the end of March the saw mill line has not been installed by this company"".
""I think the whole committee felt that the performance was complacent and this was a sufficiently grave situation for the auditor general to qualify the accounts, which rarely happens,"" he told BBC Wales.
""I think the committee will be referring this to the full assembly to draw this to their attention,"" he said.","The chief executive of Natural Resources Wales has denied the organisation had the ""wool pulled over our eyes"" by a sawmill operator given a 10 year timber contract that was criticised by an audit.",39409678,xsum,"The CEO of Natural Resources Wales (NRW), Emyr Roberts, has given ambiguous responses when questioned as to whether a £39m deal with an unnamed company to purchase and use diseased larch timber had complied with state aid rules.

But the Uruguay striker, 27, can now train and play in friendly matches, with new club Barcelona confirming: ""He will join the first team's training session, scheduled for Friday.
""The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou.""
It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon.
A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing ""organised"" matches but now allows him to take part in all ""football-related activities"", will be published at a later date.
He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico.
But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month.
Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment.
Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed.""
But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended.
World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"".
It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment.""
In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities.
His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"".
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team.""
""By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate,"" said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes.
""What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender.""
Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance.
He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.
In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.",Luis Suarez's four-month ban for biting an opponent has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).,28783667,xsum,"Luis Suarez, an Uruguay striker, has had his ban from all football activities reduced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).

He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his nine-match ban in competitive international games. Suarez's legal team argued that FIFA's decision to impose a worldwide ban was too harsh. Meanwhile, world players' union Fifpro says it is disappointed that the ""disproportionate"" sanctions remain in place.","Barcelona's Luis Suarez has won some easing of the ban that has kept him from playing football since he bit Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in June.

7079,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff.
Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer.
His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner.
But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.
The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals.
Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories.
But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1.
So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it?
In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer.
But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman.
And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk.
He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"".
His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994.
He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare.
He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.
Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House.
Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento.
Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves.
But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked.
Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.
But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.
Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.
As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players.
Mr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise.
Names that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low.
One factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items.
If no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal.
The 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.","The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.",36379212,xsum,"Efforts to rescue UK retailer BHS from collapse and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff continue after it entered administration in April.

However, if a deal can't be reached, the business may have to be liquidated. Several companies are lined up to act as liquidators including Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers.
","Efforts to save struggling retailer BHS from closure and secure the jobs of its 11k staff are still ongoing. Greg Tufnell is now the front-runner thanks to a surprise late bid led by the retail veteran and backed by Portuguese money. Another consortium, led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has suffered setbacks, while other suitors have failed to impress with their proposals. Tufnell describes himself as a ""highly experienced managing director with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"".

7773,"Kjell Lindgren played Amazing Grace on the pipes after recording a message about research scientist Victor Hurst, who was involved in astronaut training.
It is thought to be the first time that bagpipes have been played in space.
They were made for Mr Lindgren by McCallum Bagpipes at the company's factory in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.
Kenny Macleod, who works at McCallum Bagpipes, told BBC Scotland the 42-year-old astronaut had got in touch two years ago to say he was going to the space station and wanted to play the pipes while he was there.
""He wondered if it was feasible to play bagpipes,"" he said.
""They're made of plastic - they're just easier to keep clean and to make sure they're not contaminated. They're also lighter.""
In the video, Mr Lindgren is seen to give the pipes a punch before he starts playing. Mr Macleod said it was normal for pipers to massage the bag to get the air flowing, ""but not quite as vigorously as that"".
""The thing about bagpipes is that they're very difficult to play at high altitude because the air is that bit thinner. They're quite hard to blow so he's done well,"" he added.
There are six astronauts currently in space on the 45th expedition to the International Space Centre.
In a video recorded in the last few days, Mr Lindgren said all of them had come into contact with Dr Hurst during their training and were ""shocked and saddened"" to hear about his death.
Dr Hurst worked for US engineering company Wyle Science as a research scientist and instructor. He died suddenly in October, aged 48.
Nasa flight engineer Mr Lindgren said: ""He always had a quick smile, a kind word. I don't know if anyone was more enthusiastic and professional about being involved in human space flight.""",A US astronaut has played a set of Scottish-made bagpipes on the International Space Station to pay tribute to a colleague who died.,34757254,xsum,"Astronaut Kjell Lindgren has played Amazing Grace on bagpipes while aboard the International Space Station, thought to be the first ever performance of the musical instrument in orbit.

2384,"Ancient sites like Palmyra have suffered destruction, and it is feared that hundreds of precious valuables have been smuggled out of the country to be sold on the international art market.
Art specialist Christopher Marinello is chief executive of the Art Recovery Group, which has retrieved US$500m (Â£330m) of stolen and looted works of art over the past decade.
He spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about what can be done to help stop the theft of the country's precious antiquities.
""We've been aware of smuggled goods from Syria for some time. As a lawyer in New York, I represented a lot of galleries, auction houses and dealers that had problems bringing items in and out of the United States. So I was very aware of the smuggling routes that take place, and the traffic that is involved with antiquities.
""What's happened now is Isis and other people are taking advantage of the war in Syria to tap into these markets and sell their goods on a worldwide basis.
""You've got some very poor people doing the digging, and selling to a middleman who moves the objects on to Lebanon, through Beirut into Turkey and then into the Western world. We've heard reports of Isis taxing the trade, up to around 20%.
""The number one funding for Isis is oil, and after that, kidnapping and ransom demands. When they don't have access to those, they look for something else, and the antiquities in their backyard have provided a natural source for income.
""Stopping this crisis requires a multi-faceted approach, where number one is [to] stop the war. Number two is to increase awareness of collectors and dealers and auction houses not to purchase material that has no provenance.
""We are just one small portion of the solution: we run the Art Claim database. We have donated our services to museums and anyone on the ground who wants to identify works that are being looted. A museum can download its entire collection and say 'put this on your database; if anything ever appears in the marketplace, it's not authorised to be sold'.
""As soon as the conflict happened in Syria, we reached out to our contacts on the ground to put everything they could on the database, even before it was stolen.
Syria's riches
""Once a looted object is reported to us, it goes onto the database. Then we check the sales catalogues of all the major auction houses. We've got teams of people checking eBay, Amazon, other sale venues. We're also a very sophisticated searchable database with visual recognition software, so dealers and collectors contact us and say 'I'm about to buy something' or 'someone's approached me with something. Should I buy it? Is it on your database?'
""The first thing we look at is the provenance. Where did you get it from? Do you have a receipt? Was there a history that was given to you? We can't always rely on it because we've known the smugglers to falsify provenance information. But we look at what was given. And we're pretty adept at determining whether it's legitimate or not or whether it was made up or whether it's completely absent.
""We then notify the authorities. We are a free service to law enforcement. They know that if they place objects on our database, we will tell them where they are. We turn over all the information. I'm about to go to Venice at the invitation of the Italian government, and that follows Poland and Romania and Bulgaria and other governments.
""We have several hundred thousand objects on our database, and that's only since March, 2015. It's growing exponentially. The FBI database has just 15,000 objects. The Interpol database has about 40,000 objects. The Italian police have a fantastic database, and next year they will be changing it to work with Interpol.
""But they're not actually checking the marketplace the way we are. They don't have the funds to do that. They don't have the manpower.
""The Italians have done it right: they've got 300 officers dedicated to art crime. But let's look at the United States: a 320 million population with just 16 FBI agents in the art crime team. And they're also assigned to bomb duty as well.
""Here in London there are just a handful of in the art crime unit. They are overworked, underpaid and the whole department could use an overhaul.
""We've noticed a big jump in dealers and collectors checking with us, and that is evidence of fear.
""In the US, the FBI has issued a declaration that anybody who is found to have been purchasing looted Syrian objects could be prosecuted under a US Federal Law about funding international terrorism. That's pretty scary.
""We've seen some wild reports that the markets are being flooded with this material, but we haven't seen the really high-end antiquities getting here. We know of a recent container that was seized here in the UK with a great deal of Syrian looted objects on it, and I can't go too much beyond that because it's a current investigation here in the UK.
""But other than that container, we're seeing a lot of low-level material, and a lot of fakes. A lot of people are trying to take advantage of the situation and send fakes through and pretend that they're real.
""The better, more reputable auction houses do not want to sell this type of material in their sales room. It's the lower to mid-level dealer that [poses the risk]. It's that way with fine art as well: you always have those people who are looking to get a good deal without asking any questions.
""That's a big threat because it creates a market, and as long as there's a market for this type of illicit and looted material, it's going to be dug out of the ground. And when you have a situation like we have in Syria - where the government is near collapse, and there's no authority to really stop the export of this type of material - you have chaos.""
The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST. Listen online or download the podcast.","Syria's cultural heritage is being attacked from all sides: the Assad regime, opportunistic looters, opposition forces, so-called Islamic State fighters and even Russian air strikes.",34732945,xsum,"As we have previously highlighted, ISIS is increasingly turning to the illegal trade of antiquities to generate funding. According to Christopher Marinello, CEO of the Art Recovery Group, ISIS is also taxing the trade in antiquities up to around 20% and while the number one funding for ISIS is oil, looted antiquities provide a natural source of income. Marinello says that enforcement of restrictions on antiquities trade must be multi-faceted, with efforts ranging from increasing awareness of collectors, dealers and auction houses of the need for provenance, to stopping the war. Overall, stopping the illegal trade in antiquities will require significant funds, personnel and technology, all of which are in short supply.
","International art market is being flooded with looted Syrian antiquities to generate funds for ISIS. Chris Marinello, CEO of Art Recovery Group that has so far retrieved $500mn stolen art, warns that looting from Syria will stop only when the war ends and people become aware of the illegal trade. Marinello has donated its service by running the Art Claim database to museums and individuals on the ground to identify looted art. The database is searchable, identifies and notifies the authorities of looted items on online sale venues. However, there is a need for increased multitiered approach to stop smuggling of Syrian looted antiquities.

4495,"Investigators in Operation Pallial have found evidence of 140 allegations of historical abuse between 1963 and 1992.
Seventy six new complainants have also come forward.
The claims centre on 18 homes involving offences against boys and girls aged between seven and 19.
A total of 84 suspected offenders have been named - 75 male and nine female. Of these, 16 have been named by more than one complainant.
By Mark EastonHome editor
The scale of the investigation is quite a surprise.
We had a huge police investigation in the 1990s and we had a public inquiry led by a former judge, as well as other inquiries.
And here we are all these years later, we look at this again and discover that it is far more widespread - over four decades, going right back to the early 1960s.
Previously, we thought it started during a period from the mid-1970s and the investigation now covers, not just three or four children's homes, but 18 children's homes.
We are talking about systemic, serious sexual and physical abuse that, it would appear, has been conducted by a large number of people.
There are 84 names - 75 men but nine women as well.
If the allegations are true, it's an appalling scandal and a scandal that, as some victims have said, was left unresolved for far too long.
It is believed that 10 of the 16 may be deceased.
Home Secretary Theresa May ordered this inquiry following a Newsnight report in November, that as well as leading to a Tory peer being falsely accused of paedophilia, alleged that child abuse in north Wales in the 1970s and 1980s was far more widespread than had previously been investigated.
North Wales Chief Constable Mark Polin said: ""Offenders quite rightly should have to look over their shoulders for the rest of their lives.""
Keith Bristow, director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), has agreed to continue investigations at the request of Mark Polin, the North Wales chief constable.
""I took the decision to ask the director general of the National Crime Agency to investigate these allegations last November conscious that some victims of historic abuse may not have the necessary level of confidence in North Wales Police to report these matters directly to us,"" Mr Polin said.
""Operation Pallial has now secured accounts from almost all victims who are willing to support an investigation and it makes absolute sense for the officers and staff involved to date to be the core of phase two and to move matters forward as quickly as professionally as possible.""
At a news conference in Colwyn Bay, Mr Polin told victims: ""It's never too late to report abuse.""
He also sent a message to offenders, saying: ""If you believe the passage of time will reduce the resolve of Operation Pallial or any police force to identify people who are still alive and to bring them to justice, you are sorely mistaken.""
Det Supt Ian Mulcahey of Merseyside Police is leading the day-to-day investigation.
He said: ""We're prioritising our work focus on those individuals who pose the greatest risk to the public.
""I want to reassure the community that we are taking their allegations seriously and my officers are dedicated top ensuring that people who are responsible for these offences are held to account regardless of the passage of time.""
Mr Bristow said the rest of the investigation would be conducted as quickly as professionally possible.
He said he believed it was ""very positive"" that so many people had come forward and that he hoped victims would receive more support than perhaps they had done in the past.
A Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer has been appointed to assist Operation Pallial.
The CPS lawyer has advised ""the priority should be given to the most serious allegations and the prioritisation process has been agreed with them"".
The investigation involves police officers and staff, primarily from forces in north-west England, supported by members of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP Centre).
By December it had heard from 105 victims of alleged abuse.
At the time, Det Supt Mulcahey said the investigation would ""follow the evidence without fear or favour"".
A separate review by Mrs Justice Macur is investigating the terms of the Waterhouse abuse inquiry, which began in 1996.
It examined the abuse of victims in former north Wales care homes such as Bryn Estyn in Wrexham dating back to the 1970s.
The new inquiry followed a victim's claims that Sir Ronald Waterhouse only uncovered a fraction of the abuse.
Those claims surfaced in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Last week, one man was arrested in Ipswich, Suffolk, as part of Operation Pallial and questioned on suspicion of serious sexual offences against a number of people. He has been bailed until July.
Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service in Wales, said: ""This latest investigation is a major step forward investigating claims of wide spread child abuse.
""Many who have been waiting decades for justice and for their voices to be heard have now finally found the courage to come forward and we mustn't fail them this time.""
Keith Gregory, a Wrexham councillor who alleges he was abused as a child while in care at Bryn Estyn, says victims will feel they are now being believed.
""To bring justice these allegations need to be looked at,"" said Mr Gregory.
""It feels like at last we are starting to be believed.""
Malcolm King, who was chair of social services at the former Clwyd county council and who campaigned for a judicial inquiry, called for a royal commission on the issue of child abuse.","An independent investigation examining claims of historical child abuse at children's homes in north Wales has found ""significant evidence of systemic and serious sexual and physical abuse"".",22306588,xsum,"The ongoing investigation, Operation Pallial, has uncovered evidence of 140 allegations of historical abuse against boys and girls aged between seven and 19 between 1963 and 1992, with claims centering on 18 homes.

8828,"But in April - before the EU referendum - the then home secretary gave a speech warning of the implications of a vote to leave the EU. Here's how some of the key quotes compare:
April 2016: ""So, if we do vote to leave the European Union, we risk bringing the development of the single market to a halt, we risk a loss of investors and businesses to remaining EU member states driven by discriminatory EU policies, and we risk going backwards when it comes to international trade.
""But the big question is whether, in the event of Brexit, we would be able to negotiate a new free trade agreement with the EU and on what terms.""
January 2017: ""I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement.""
April 2016: ""The reality is that we do not know on what terms we would win access to the single market. We do know that in a negotiation we would need to make concessions in order to access it, and those concessions could well be about accepting EU regulations, over which we would have no say, making financial contributions, just as we do now, accepting free movement rules, just as we do now, or quite possibly all three combined.
""It is not clear why other EU member states would give Britain a better deal than they themselves enjoy.""
January 2017: ""If we were excluded from accessing the single market, we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model.
""But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds... and I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point.""
April 2016: ""It is tempting to look at developing countries' economies, with their high growth rates, and see them as an alternative to trade with Europe. But just look at the reality of our trading relationship with China - with its dumping policies, protective tariffs and industrial-scale industrial espionage. And look at the figures. We export more to Ireland than we do to China, almost twice as much to Belgium as we do to India, and nearly three times as much to Sweden as we do to Brazil. It is not realistic to think we could just replace European trade with these new markets.""
""And while we could certainly negotiate our own trade agreements, there would be no guarantee that they would be on terms as good as those we enjoy now. There would also be a considerable opportunity cost given the need to replace the existing agreements - not least with the EU itself - that we would have torn up as a consequence of our departure.""
January 2017: ""We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us.""
April 2016 (responding to a question from the BBC): ""What matters is that we have brought about changes in the free movement rules as a result of the negotiation.""
January 2017: ""As home secretary for six years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe.""
April 2016: ""With no agreement, we know that WTO rules would oblige the EU to charge 10% tariffs on UK car exports, in line with the tariffs they impose on Japan and the United States. They would be required to do the same for all other goods upon which they impose tariffs.  Not all of these tariffs are as high as 10%, but some are considerably higher.""
January 2017: ""And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.
""Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors to Britain.""","Theresa May has said the UK will emerge from Brexit as a ""great, global trading nation"", becoming ""safer, more secure and more prosperous"".",38653681,xsum,"Comparing quotes from April 2016 and January 2017, the article highlights how UK Prime Minister Theresa May's stance on Brexit has changed.

Kilmarnock started the brighter, though Tony Watt passed up a glorious chance from close range for Hearts.
The home side took the lead when Souleymane Coulibaly curled a shot in from distance wide on the right.
Steven Smith then added a sublime second to seal the three points when he lobbed goalkeeper Jack Hamilton from 20 yards out.
Watt is a difficult player to get the ball off, but his finishing is one that needs improving. He'd only scored once this season but he should have doubled his tally in the fourth minute. He started the move with mazy play in the midfield before releasing the pass.
When it eventually arrived at Robbie Muirhead wide on the left the former Killie player delivered the perfect cross for Watt two yards out. But instead of volleying the ball into the net he managed to fluff his effort by only killing the ball and allowing goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald to smother.
Souleymane Coulibaly is gradually becoming the Kilmarnock talisman. Twice he had decent efforts before he did give the home side the lead. His first was a header which was blocked by his team-mate Nathan Tyson, his second a 25-yard free kick which curled inches wide of Jack Hamilton's right hand post.
It was third time lucky but it was more than fortunate it was another spectacular effort.
The Ivorian striker showed all his close control skills holding off challenges at the right edge of the penalty box. As he stumbled he quickly regained his balance to elude the tackle from Faycal Rherras then from 16 yards on the angle he curled a superb shot with his left foot which flew past the Hearts 'keeper into the right hand corner of his net for his ninth goal of the season.
Coulibaly came so close to adding a second before the interval, this time showing terrific spring in his legs to rise high six yards out to head goalbound a Tyson cross. However, Hamilton did well to turn away the striker's effort.
Muirhead had a 30 yard free kick which stung the hands of MacDonald who gathered at the second attempt, while at the other end Jordan Jones flicked a volley wide of the target.
Lee Clark has praised Rory McKenzie's performances in recent weeks and his harrying in an advanced central midfield role ensured the Hearts defenders were not getting time on the ball. He hit a left foot shot which clipped the bar before going over and then produced the assist for Killie's second goal.
McKenzie's tenacious play saw him gather possession midway inside then Hearts half and as he turned he spotted Smith advancing in a central area. The midfielder played the ball into his captain's path and he duly delivered the perfect finish. Smith's left foot curling strike into the top left hand corner of the net from 25 yards showing it's not only Coulibaly who can produce the spectacular.
Substitute Bjorn Johnsen had a chance to pull a goal back for Hearts, but he, like the strikers he replaced, could not provide a composed finish with only the goalkeeper to beat from six yards.
Kilmarnock's form at home has been poor recently but this victory - only their fifth in their last 28 top flight matches - may well have given them a welcome boost for the rest of the campaign.
Kilmarnock's Lee Clark: ""I'm absolutely delighted. From the first whistle to the last we were outstanding as a team and individually some brilliant performances, but as group superb.
""We've won by two but we could have won by more.
""Rory McKenzie, Steven Smith and Gary Dicker set the tone when we had to press and also when we had to come off Hearts and get a good shape.
""We scored two wonderful goals and I'm absolutely delighted with the three points.
""Souleymane Coulibaly is a real showman. The fans love him. He's going to have his own montage of goals-of-the-season.
""The manner of the win against quality opposition tells me and it tells the players that as long as we stick to what we're about then we can get results home or away.""
Hearts' Robbie Neilson: ""The performance is disappointing but the biggest issue for me is we had that opportunity to go into second place and put pressure on Celtic and Aberdeen and we didn't manage to take it. If we want to compete at the top of the league when we get that opportunity we need to grasp it.
""Credit to Kilmarnock they pressed us really well and we didn't deserve to take anything out of the game. You have to compete, you have to turn teams and we were too easy to play against tonight.
""We have to move on to Inverness and try and rectify a poor display.""

1734,"Dr Barry Morgan said the Wales Bill, passed last week after a vote of approval by AMs, was unjust.
He added that Scotland and Northern Ireland were offered ""better deals"".
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has previously said it meant people in Wales would get more say over ""everyday decisions in their lives"".
Dr Morgan is due to retire after 14 years leading the Church in Wales.
The Wales Bill offers to extend the transfer of powers over tax, energy, transport and the assembly's own affairs but there have been claims it would reduce AMs law-making powers
Dr Morgan told the BBC's Newyddion9 programme: ""Devolution in Wales is a matter of equality and fairness and we have not reached that point yet, as far as Wales is in the question in my opinion.""
Asked if devolution needed to go further and faster, he said: ""Of course. And I don't believe the latest bill which was passed is a just settlement.
""But, on the other hand, this is the only thing we'll be given at the moment.
""In 20 years we have reached a very good point. We now have a government which is responsible for a number of things in Wales and it's much better than having a Welsh secretary and two ministers controlling Wales.
""That is much better but it has not gone as far as it should, because Scotland and Northern Ireland have been given better deals than Wales.""
Dr Morgan, who is retiring on Tuesday, has supported numerous causes while at the helm of the church, including more powers for the Welsh Assembly.","The devolution settlement for Wales is less fair than those offered to Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Archbishop of Wales has said.",38774843,xsum,"Dr Barry Morgan, who is retiring after leading the Church in Wales for 14 years, has criticised the Wales Bill, passed on 15 November, claiming it does not offer “equality and fairness”.

Scotland and Northern Ireland, Morgan contends, were offered “better deals”. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns claims that the bill provides more say over “everyday decisions in their lives” for people in Wales.","Dr. Barry Morgan, in his final interview as the archbishop of Wales, has criticised the country’s devolution settlement, calling it unjust and inferior to the arrangements currently in place in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Morgan’s comments come just one week after the Welsh Assembly voted to approve the Wales Bill which aims to extend powers over the areas of policy that include tax, transport, energy and higher education. In Morgan’s view, the legislation does not go far enough in devolving powers to Wales, and in calling for greater and more rapid devolution, he emphasised the importance of fairness and equality.

3968,"But the Frenchman's situation remains ""challenging"" and the 25-year-old is in a critical but stable condition.
Earlier, Bianchi's father Philippe had described the situation as ""desperate"".
""Every time the telephone goes, we know it could be the hospital to tell us that Jules is dead,"" he said.
""He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it.""
He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: ""I speak to him. I know he can hear me.
""His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up.
""His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules.""
Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules.
""I've never seen anything like that,"" Philippe said. ""It touched us very deeply. We thank every one of them. So many of them have been in touch, written to me; [Fernando] Alonso, [Jean-Eric] Vergne, [Felipe] Massa have given strong messages.
""[Lewis] Hamilton wrote me a beautiful email in which he says that if there is anything he can do, he's there. [Valentino] Rossi and [Marc] Marquez from Moto GP too.""
Philippe also said he is using the accident of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who continues his recovery at home after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident in December, as a reference point.
""I was very sad when he got hurt,"" Philippe said. ""I kept wondering, like every one else 'Why don't they tell us more about how he is?'.
""But now I'm in the same position I understand. Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable.

He added: ""It's tough. In a week the life of this family has been destroyed. What are we doing here? Living a nightmare in a place very far from home.

4725,"""I'm feeling the joints for any kind of heat or swelling.""
Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination.
""I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,"" she says, ""Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis.""
But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996.
This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters.
""Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,"" he says.
We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests.
As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation.
But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world.
According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results.
He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?""
Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation.
""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair.
""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.""
The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down.
But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones.
""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals.""
Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans.
Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities.""
The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health.

The White House said North Korea should ""focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations"".
The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.
But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state.
""We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made,"" he said.
""We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""
Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009.
Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year.
A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex.
But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there.
The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons ""in quality and quantity"".
It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with ""nuclear weapons any time"".
However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear.
Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim.
North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces.

1714,"Both missiles hit the water before reaching the USS Mason, a guided-missile destroyer.
A spokesman for Yemen's rebel Houthi movement told the Saba news agency that it had not targeted any warships.
The incident came eight days after an attack on an Emirati civilian ship that was also blamed on the Houthis.
The UAE government said the high-speed catamaran was carrying aid, wounded Yemenis and passengers when it was hit in the Bab al-Mandab strait.

""We assess these missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory.""
However, a Houthi military spokesman told Saba that the charge was ""baseless and aimed to cover for the heinous Saudi crime of Saturday's air attacks on the civilian funeral hall in the capital Sanaa"", which killed more than 140 people.
A Saudi-led multinational coalition, whose air campaign against the Houthis and their allies is supported by the US, has denied any responsibility.
Also on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis at the King Fahd Air Base in Taif in central Saudi Arabia, which hosts US military personnel training the kingdom's armed forces.
A missile was also reportedly fired at the Yemeni government-controlled city of Marib in central Yemen.

5062,"Labour suffered heavy losses at the hands of the SNP, with the Tories defying opinion polls to secure a House of Commons majority.
In a speech in London, Mr Miliband said it was ""time for someone else"" to take over the leadership and that he was ""truly sorry"" he did not succeed.
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls was among the party's big-name casualties.
It also lost its election campaign chief Douglas Alexander and its leader in Scotland Jim Murphy.
Mr Miliband was applauded by staff as he arrived at Labour headquarters in central London.
He confirmed deputy leader Harriet Harman would be interim leader.
""I joined this party aged 17,"" he said. ""I never dreamed I'd lead it.""
He may have served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, but few people outside politics had heard of Ed Miliband before he was elected leader of the Labour Party in 2010, a post he has now relinquished in the wake of Labour's election defeat.
He had spent much of the first 40 years of his life in the shadow of his older brother David, the former foreign secretary.
He did the same course - Philosophy, Politics and Economics - at Oxford University, at the same college, and followed David into a similar backroom role in the Labour Party, albeit on different sides of the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown divide. The two even lived in neighbouring flats in the same building for a while.
In full: The Ed Miliband Story
He joked that he would spending his time ""reacquainting"" himself with his wife and children, thanked the public for the ""selfies"" and - in a reference to an online trend of teenage fans - ""the most unlikely cult of the 21st century - milifandom"".
Mr Miliband said he had done his best for five years, and that it was ""not simply leadership that achieves change"".
""I will never give up on fighting for the Britain that I believe in,"" he said.
He urged supporters not to ""mourn"" the defeat.
""We have come back before and this party will come back again,"" he added.
Speaking earlier after retaining his Doncaster North seat, Mr Miliband said his party had been overwhelmed by a ""surge of nationalism"".
Ms Harman confirmed she would step down as deputy leader once the new leadership is in place.
Labour MP Tom Watson - the party's former campaign co-ordinator - confirmed that he would consider running to replace her.
""I've always thought that the deputy leader role is the campaigning role,"" he told BBC News.
""We've got a mayoral election in Tower Hamlets to fight in six weeks' time. Who knows, we might even have a by-election for London mayor.
""So this party has got to keep campaigning whilst we try and understand what's gone on in the general election.""
Mr Balls lost his Morley and Outwood seat to Conservative candidate Andrea Jenkyns by 422 votes.
""Any personal disappointment I have at this result is as nothing compared to the sense of sorrow I have at the result Labour has achieved across the UK, and the sense of concern I have about the future,"" he said.
Mr Balls said questions would arise about the future of the United Kingdom and Britain's position in Europe over the next five years.
Labour also lost previous leader Gordon Brown's former constituency to the SNP as the nationalist party almost swept the board in Scotland.
Mr Alexander lost his seat to a 20-year-old student after a massive 26.9% swing from Labour to the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South.
Conceding defeat, Mr Murphy said: ""The party that has traditionally been the tireless champion of the underdog now finds itself in the position of being the underdog.
""Scotland needs a strong Labour Party and our fight-back starts tomorrow morning.""
Former Labour Home Secretary Lord Reid told the BBC ""changing the captain"" would not necessarily improve Labour's electoral prospects.
""They (the public) thought we were on the wrong side of all the major arguments - our economic competence, on the question of creating wealth rather than just distributing wealth, on the question of immigration, on the question of reform of the public services,"" he said.
Another Labour peer, former First Minister Lord McConnell, said his party had experienced a ""catastrophic night"".

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"".
He said it would continue to focus on adult education.
Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire.
BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued.
Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years.
She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut.
She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"".
The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added.
Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course.
One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.""
Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"".
Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts.

8397,"This weekend will be my first outing at the Stade Jean-Bouin as I didn't take part last year. Those that did play recall tricolours aplenty and a rousing French crowd who were enjoying sevens rugby in Paris for the first time since 2006.
With South Africa 25 points clear at the top of the standings with two tournaments to play, they only need to make the quarter-finals to secure the overall series title.
Samoa shocked a few people when they claimed victory in Paris last year, coached by Damian McGrath. He now coaches Canada, who claimed a well-deserved but unanticipated victory in Singapore in the last round.
This weekend, the series welcomes newly qualified Spain. They won the qualification tournament in Hong Kong and will compete as a core side on the tour next season, having played in the Olympics last summer. They are a passionate group and will be a tough opposition for us as we meet them in our first group game on Saturday.
The grand finale will again take place in London on 20 and 21 May. Returning to Twickenham for the 10th and last leg of the series is a particularly special occasion for us in the England team.
Setting foot on the hallowed - and incredibly well kept - turf at the home of rugby is a dream for many young players in England and it was no different for me. There is part of me that still feels awestruck when I allow myself to picture that moment standing in the tunnel leading the team out in front of the home crowd. The eight-year-old me playing at East Grinstead Rugby Club didn't even dream this big.
The London Sevens also provides a rare opportunity for us to play in front of friends and family. 90% of our playing time is overseas and, while this allows us to connect with fantastic support for England around the world, our friends and family only enjoy the experience on TV. So this is the occasion when we get to truly share the excitement of the journey with our loved ones.
The roar we get at Twickenham is like no other. A pre-tournament treat for our home leg is choosing which song will play when we take the field, but whatever we choose, the music is lost in the sound of cheering fans and this is the most motivating song we could ask for.
In 15-a-side rugby, the difference between players' positions and roles is very clear. This is not always so obvious in sevens, where you have to be a bit of a jack of all trades - everyone must tackle, pass well, achieve certain speeds (minimum 32kph) etc.
Loosely we can divide up a squad into four categories - playmakers (scrum-half, fly-half), strike runners (centres, wings), enforcers (props), and link player/fetcher (hooker). I'm a playmaker, and we are responsible for running the attack and manipulating defences. Often the playmakers are also the kickers and sweep behind the line in defence.
The strike runners, such as Dan Norton, are the headline grabbers. They specialise in hot stepping and high speeds, and can hit speeds in excess of 37kph, which is over 10m per second. Tom Bowen utilises both of these attributes brilliantly to beat defenders.
The enforcers are often the big boys, but even the props in sevens will run 1,200m in just over four minutes. These guys are often the bosses at the set piece and are also the physical presence in attack and defence.
The link player/fetchers are most commonly the hookers. Often these guys are the dogs - putting their heads in tackles and rucks for 14 minutes. ""Housewives' favourite"" Phil Burgess is an ever-present in this role and so these guys need to have a good engine.
One player missing out on Paris through injury is Richard de Carpentier. He has been a force to be reckoned with on the World Series this year, terrorising opposition with his steam-train carrying and wrecking-ball defence.
On and off the field, ""Chippy"" enjoys a witty quip. At scrum time he has been known to have a jibe at the opposition prop and he is always on the lookout for a joke. Just don't steal his tea bags otherwise you'll see a different side to him.
Appropriately, Rich picked up the award this week for England Sevens player of the year at the RPA awards.

7207,"A review of homes in Wales said they were seen as places of ""irreversible decline"" where residents were unable to do things that matter to them.
The report was published by the Older People's Commissioner for Wales.
The Welsh government said it was already taking action on issues raised in the report, A Place to Call Home?
Care Forum Wales, which represents 500 care providers, said the findings support what it has long been saying.
Experts in health and social care undertook unannounced visits to 100 care homes across Wales.
And more than 2,000 questionnaires were completed by care home residents and their families.
The report's key conclusion was: ""Too many older people living in care homes quickly become institutionalised. Their personal identity and individuality rapidly diminishes and they have a lack of choice and control over their lives.""
It looked at residents' social participation, their home environment, diet, staffing and training as well as commissioning, regulation and inspection of services.
Commissioner Sarah Rochira called ""for action to deliver the change required within our care homes and ensure that quality of life sits at the heart of the delivery of residential and nursing care across Wales"".
She said: ""While my review found excellent examples of truly person-centred care, enabling and empowering care that delivers the very best outcomes for older people, there are significant variations across Wales that result in too many older people living in care homes having an unacceptable quality of life.""
The review was undertaken using the commissioner's statutory powers which means care providers and public bodies have to act on the findings.
Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) chief inspector Imelda Richardson said it had moved away from a tick box culture to focusing on quality of life of people during its inspections of older people's care homes in Wales.
She said while the majority of care homes provide good or excellent care, there is ""still an unacceptable level of care in some homes"".
Care Forum Wales chair Mario Kreft said the report did not ""fully recognise what is being achieved despite the system"".
He supported a call for services being commissioned for quality rather than reinforcing a ""culture of compliance to the bare minimum"".
He added: ""The commissioning process should be about quality and securing value for money and not about paying the lowest possible price.""
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The Welsh government, for its part, is already taking action on many of the areas highlighted in this report through a draft Bill to strengthen the regulation and inspection of social services.
""We expect the care sector to consider this report carefully - as the Welsh government will - and reply to the Older People's Commissioner's specific points.""","Many older people living in care homes have an ""unacceptable quality of life"" and quickly become institutionalised, says a watchdog.",29976769,xsum,"A report published by the Older People's Commissioner for Wales highlights that ""too many older people living in care homes quickly become institutionalized...and have a lack of choice and control over their lives"".

Forest sacked boss Dougie Freedman on Sunday after a run of five defeats in six, but Gary Gardner's 30-yard strike put them ahead at the break.
Hull substitute Aluko rescued a draw, sliding the ball in after a deflection.
The goal came with 17 minutes remaining and lifted a restless home crowd who had seen their side struggle to create chances against an impressive Forest defence.
Although Abel Hernandez hit the post early on, Hull, who drop to fourth, were lifeless in attack and Gardner's sensational strike, after a neat passing move, increased the nerves.
Reds substitute Oliver Burke, who replaced debutant Federico Macheda following his loan move from Cardiff, could have made it 2-0 after a swift counter-attack.
But the hosts rallied, with Aluko making the most of a cruel deflection from Tom Huddlestone's shot to make it 1-1 and Mohamed Diame wasting a great chance for victory when he fired an effort just wide.

5875,"The move showed the UK has no ""real influence"" over world events, Russia's foreign ministry said.
Mr Johnson said events in Syria had ""changed the situation fundamentally"" and he would go to G7 talks instead.
The UK deplored ""Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime even after the chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians,"" he added.
The foreign secretary said: ""We call on Russia to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated.""
Rather than travelling to Moscow to meet Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, he will now be travelling to Lucca, in Italy, for a G7 meeting, where he will call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull his troops from Syria.
His Russian visit, which would have been the first by a UK foreign secretary in five years, was cancelled after discussions with the US, which is sending Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Moscow to deliver a ""clear and co-ordinated"" message to the Kremlin.
In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: ""During Johnson's visit to Moscow there were plans to hold open and exhaustive talks on the entire spectrum of international problems, and also to discuss the state of Russo-British relations, which have, in essence, been forced into a dead end by the UK.
""The decision to call off Johnson's visit to Moscow confirms once again doubts in the presence of added value in speaking to the UK, which does not have its own position on the majority of present-day issues, nor does it have real influence on the course of international affairs, as it remains 'in the shadow' of its strategic partners.
""We do not feel that we need dialogue with London any more than it does.""
The Russian statement added that Mr Johnson's plan to ""discuss Russian support for the Assad regime"" with G7 partners showed a ""fundamental misunderstanding or ignorance of what is happening in Syria, Russia's efforts to settle this crisis, and the purpose of diplomacy in general"".
Russia and Iran have condemned US air strikes against Syria as a violation of international law.
The SNP's Foreign Affairs spokesman Alex Salmond joined in with the criticism of the foreign secretary on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, saying: ""Boris Johnson just looks daft.
""What is the argument for not going ahead with a visit?
""Rex Tillerson is going on Wednesday so it can't be that we have moved to a Cold War position of no talking whatsoever.
""And the idea that the foreign secretary can't be trusted because he might pursue his own line or have an independent thought or cross over what the Americans might say makes him look like some kind of 'mini-me' to the USA and that's not a position that any foreign secretary would want to be in.""
Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News the foreign secretary ""should be in Moscow nowâ€¦ saying to the Russians just how appalling the situation is and the role they should play"".
He added: ""We've got to be frank with them and we shouldn't just allow the Americans to go off and do that. We should be doing that ourselves.""
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron claimed Mr Johnson was considered a diplomatic liability.
""Boris has revealed himself to be a poodle of Washington, having his diary managed from across the pond,"" said Mr Farron.
""It is pretty shameful when even Trump judges you to be a buffoon.""
A government source accused Mr Johnson's critics of playing politics.
""It's a shame that some like Farron, Salmond and McDonnell put polls and politics above sorting out a civil war - it's very sad and shows how desperate they are,"" they said.
BBC Political Correspondent Ben Wright said the criticism would not ""unduly bother"" Mr Johnson, who had spent the weekend calling counterparts, including the Germans. French and Italians, ahead of the G7 meeting. The foreign secretary would also be speaking to Mr Tillerson again, ahead of the US Secretary of State's visit to Moscow to agree a joint position on Syria.
Mr Johnson's position was defended by International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who said the UK was working with the US and international partners on a co-ordinated response in the wake of US missile attacks on Syria.
She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""This isn't just about one voice.
""This is about the international community coming together and our foreign secretary is working with his American counterpart as that is the right thing to do.""
In January, Mr Johnson said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be allowed to run for election to remain in power and warned that Britain may have to ""think afresh"" about how to handle the crisis after failing to live up to its long-held position that the dictator must go.
But sources insisted he has always believed Assad cannot remain in power.
It comes as UK Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Russia was to blame for ""every civilian death"" in the chemical weapons attack last week in Syria.
Sir Michael, writing in the Sunday Times, said the Kremlin was responsible ""by proxy"" as the ""principal backer"" of the Assad regime.",Russia has criticised Boris Johnson's decision to scrap a planned trip to Moscow after discussions with the US.,39544432,xsum,"UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has cancelled a visit to Russia following last week’s chemical weapons attack in Syria, focusing instead on the forthcoming G7 meeting in Lucca, Italy, where he will discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria with other foreign ministers.

Scotland on Sunday saw print sales fall more than 20%. It now has an average weekly sale of less than 25,000. It doesn't have its own staff any more, relying on a journalism pool shared with its stablemate, The Scotsman.
""SoS"" is now being beaten by the only weekly ""regional"" paper to register a rise in print sales, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sunday Herald looked to be on its last legs, but found a niche by backing the independence cause.
Approving ""Yes"" campaigners backed it, with a big lift in the back half of last year, from which it's fallen back, but still retained an average 29,000 weekly sales.
Its publisher, Newsquest, also saw a gap in the daily market for pro-independence readers. Although the figures aren't audited, we're told they're selling nearly 17,000 a day.
These are small numbers when set alongside the total sale of newspapers. The constitutional debate may have polarised opinion and changed some buying behaviour, but it can be overstated. The decline of sales in Scotland has recently been steeper than those for the rest of the UK, but the trends are similar.
Meanwhile, publishers point out there's a rise in online readership. But that's not making them enough money to sustain their cost bases. In the case of the Scotsman's figures, daily online readers are down 33% since a busy referendum period.
Those news publishers are competing with broadcasters for online readers. We've just got half year figures for STV which show  it aiming to achieve its turnaround by the end of next year.
A high priority is the desire to find a new earner from making drama series, as royalties from Taggart re-runs fade to black.
It's finding the transition and investing in new services can be expensive, with an Â£800,000 half-year loss on its two city stations, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh.
They're being watched by 900,000 people in the average month which, we're told, is 30% of the potential audience. The Glasgow channel is being aimed at break-even by the end of this year.
STV also lost a wad of cash by having to bail out Mirriad, a digital advertising firm in which it invested. It may have failed to raise the finance needed without the bail-out, but it's clever stuff, ""advertising to the skip generation"", with personalised product placement embedded in video content.
For instance, a music video might have a street scene, in which a background billboard has ads which differ, depending on who is viewing.
Advertising is not part of the BBC debate. Not yet anyway. But as the future of the licence fee is discussed, they are a sort of subliminal presence on the background billboards.
A project, financed by the BBC and published this week, sought to find out how small groups of people responded to living without the corporation's TV, radio and online content for a few days.
It concluded the group who resented having to pay the annual Â£145.50 missed it more than they expected, and some were despairing at the impact of adverts on their viewing of commercial channels.
Commissioning that research is part of the BBC's fight for its very existence, at least if you believe some of the interpretation of the government's green paper on how the next 10-year charter is going to change things. The charter is due to start from the end of next year.
We're half way through the consultation on that, and so far the UK government appears to have retreated from the early briefings to delighted print rivals that Auntie might as well be put in a retirement home, her funding clipped, with a remit to leave popular entertainment to the commercial market-place.
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has been in Edinburgh for its International TV Festival this week, making reassuringly supportive comments about the BBC. He'll be aware that it has a lot of fans mobilised to defend it, including some formidable cultural celebrities. Some, including Armando Ianucci and Sue Perkins, used the Festival platform to sound off.
The context of the debate on the BBC's future in Scotland is, of course, rather different. The broadcaster's fans have not rushed forward to argue the case for it. The independence referendum seems to have left a bruised legacy of reluctance to engage.
It also left a legacy of a starkly changed political landscape, to which the BBC has to respond, even if Mr Whittingdale's green paper didn't make much of it.
The document only noted the Smith Commission's agreement that the BBC should be answerable to Holyrood on a similar basis to its accountability at Westminster (note that it's accountable for its management and use of resources, rather than its output and journalism).
On the pro-independence side, there's some tacit awareness that the broadcasting section was hardly the most compelling part of the Scottish government white paper. It proposed a new Scottish broadcaster while somehow ensuring that all the popular BBC stuff was retained.
Less tacit are vociferous critics of the BBC's political coverage, including pro-independence websites and bloggers, some threatening mass non-payment of the licence fee.
Having mobilised protests outside the BBC last year, that element continues to be fired up by Alex Salmond, in his newspaper column and promoting his book, with ever stronger condemnations of the BBC's referendum coverage.
The body set up to represent viewers, listeners and readers, the Audience Council of Scotland, took 10 months to produce a report that reflected on the referendum. When it did, it was both supportive and quite challenging of the corporation's coverage.
It said online was of ""exceptional quality"" (including something called ""expert economic analysis"" - though if there was, I missed it). But it also said coverage failed to respond to the change in campaigning style, as grass roots and social media played such a significant role.
The Council pointed to ""an opportunity to review issues in the light of experience in the referendum"", though it stopped short of explicitly calling for one.
So that was the complex background to Alex Salmond's successor, previously with little to say on the subject, setting out her thoughts on broadcasting, and the BBC in particular, with a speech at the TV festival.
Nicola Sturgeon said she approached the subject with trepidation. Her speech was very carefully worded. It's hard to believe this was anything like the speech Alex Salmond would have delivered.
Criticism of the BBC's campaign coverage last year was measured. The first minister said she saw no ""institutional bias"", and praised at least some BBC Scotland journalism.
She went on to argue that there was a failure to strike the right balance between holding independence plans up to scrutiny on a parallel basis with the prospects for remaining within the UK.
""The status quo and the consequences of voting 'No' were not really analysed at all,"" she claimed, voicing the irritation of those who feel there wasn't a level playing field.
And she cited the Audience Council in support of her view that London-based journalists had failed to catch the mood of Scots audiences. Their broad brush reports jarred, it was argued, with the detailed scrutiny of issues that had long been debated at every level of Scottish society.
BBC management responded to her speech with a statement beginning: ""We believe our coverage of the referendum was rigorously impartial and in line with our guidelines on fairness and impartiality"".
The Sturgeon speech then turned its focus on the future. For her followers, it's worth noting a change of direction - no longer talk of a Scottish Broadcasting Service splitting from the BBC, but a federal structure.
The design appears to allow for either devolution or independence. That way, it helps to disarm Ms Sturgeon's constitutional opponents in their claims that an independent Scotland would be deprived of Eastenders, Strictly Come Dancing and Sir David Attenborough.
The governance requires a Scottish board of overseers, she said, while the output requires a Scottish TV channel (in addition to BBC Alba in Gaelic), and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland.
Her most forthright criticism was of the BBC's past attempts to avoid becoming a leader of constitutional change by refusing the pressure to split its flagship network news coverage, at 6 and 10 o'clock, for a different perspective from Scotland for Scots.
""The criticism that should be levied at the BBC is not that it has tried to lead constitutional change,"" said the first minister. ""It is that it has totally failed to follow it.
""The UK has changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters are still catching up with its consequences. And although that poses questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue is maybe most acute with the BBC.""
The message was aimed at Mr Whittingdale to some extent, but more so at the BBC. So how will it respond?
Last month, the official answer to concerns about a lack of trust was to point to large audiences for the flagship news programme, Reporting Scotland. And even last month, these were ""early days"" for a debate about changes to governance.
Not any longer. Not with a BBC Trust survey finding that only 48% of Scots think that the corporation reflects their lives. That's lower than other parts of the UK.
That BBC spokesman's reaction to the first minister's speech continued: ""We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in charter review.
""The BBC's funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC.
""We will have to balance our investment on pan-UK services with dedicated services in the Nations (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). We will aim to protect spending in the Nations so that content investment is cut less than in other parts of the BBC.""
Expect more on that from the Beeb next month. With the first minister's speech, an important debate on the future of the media in Scotland has only (at last) just begun.","Scotland's media landscape is being bulldozed - transformed by digital technology, burgeoning choice, and quite a bit of politics - particularly as the future of the BBC is now in play.",34082425,xsum,"The political mood in Scotland during and following the Scottish Independence Referendum last year has left scars in the nation, with some threatening to end their subscriptions to the BBC for what they saw as unfair coverage. Although online readership increased during this period, this hasn’t made enough money to offset the decline in newspaper sales within the nation. The politics of the nation, as ever, is also driving the timing of the in/out EU Referendum announcement.  
","The decline of print newspapers and rise of online readership is affecting Scotland just as much as it is the rest of the UK. The Sunday Herald's support of the independence movement has helped to slow its decline, and in turn, its publisher Newsquest has seen success in selling a daily newspaper to pro-independence readers. In addition, the debate surrounding the future of the BBC has led to a call for a federalization of the UK's media industry, with Nicola Sturgeon suggesting the need for a separate Scottish TV channel and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland."

7210,"The evolutionary scientist, whose books include The God Delusion, said Wales was ""ahead of the rest of the UK"" in showing a decline in religious belief.
The census found 32% in Wales have no religion, against a UK figure of 25%.
The Church in Wales said Christianity was ""no longer the default setting"" for many, but the picture was complex.
Of those in Wales who described themselves as believers, the number of Christians fell by 14 percentage points to 57%.
Prof Dawkins said: ""I congratulate the people of Wales in coming out ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom in this respect - well done.""
He told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales that he believed in the ""wonder"" of scientific truth.
He said: ""People who are educated in religion are positively encouraged not to investigate, not to think sceptically about why they are here, but instead to accept what people wrote 2,000 years ago.
""I guess we do need focal points for communities but you can say also that religion has been a focal point for all sorts of backward, indeed bigoted, thinking about homosexuality, about abortion, the right to die, that we're seeing at the moment.""
He added that research commissioned by his foundation meant that the outlook for Christianity in the UK was ""even more pessimistic"" than the census data suggested.
He said many of those who put themselves down at Christian did so because they thought of themselves ""as a good person"" rather than due to belief in the virgin birth, or of Jesus Christ as the son of God.
Prof Dawkins dismissed the figures for people saying they were a Jedi knight or that heavy metal music was their religion as ""a kind of protest"" against the inclusion of a census question on religion.
The census found those in Wales who are Muslim was 1.5%, up from 0.7% in 2001, while there were also slight increases Hindus or Buddhists, both up from 0.2% to 0.3%.
There was also a rise in people saying they had other faiths, from 0.2% to 0.4% while the percentage who said they were Sikh or Jewish remained unchanged between 2001 and 2011 at 0.1%.
Churches said they were not discouraged by the findings, and argued that Christian belief was still clearly alive and well.
Following the census results, the Church in Wales said: ""It should also be borne in mind that statistics can't show the whole picture in matters of faith.
""The past few months, for example, have seen people in different parts of Wales turn to churches in their thousands following various tragic events: in Machynlleth, in Ely, in St Asaph.

6813,"Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number.
They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace.
It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years.
Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year.
But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed.
Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: ""In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly.""
The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year.
The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets.
The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are:
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation.
""It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK.
""Our vision puts the passenger at the heart of what we do, but also recognises the need to address the impacts of aviation on communities and the environment.""
Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway.
Friday also marks the start of a Â£1bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2.
The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years.
Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone.
The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns.
Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace.
Nats itself is rolling out a new Â£600m ($747m) computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays.
But Juliet Kennedy, Nats operations director, said: ""What is needed is a clear and stable UK policy that recognises how important our airspace is as a critical part of our national infrastructure.
""It is essential that we are able to balance the needs of airspace users with the environment and, of course, with the communities who experience aircraft noise.""",Air traffic controllers are warning that UK skies are running out of room for record numbers of planes.,40669144,xsum,"Today is expected to be the busiest day of the year for air traffic controllers, handling a record 8,800 flights, but the limit of the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service is being tested, warned Nats Director Jamie Hutchison.

"
5969,"Ms Sturgeon had said she hoped the ""national survey"" would involve two million people across the country.
It had been due to run until St Andrew's Day - 30 November.
Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Tuesday that the latest assessment suggested 1.7 million people had taken part.
The SNP leader and Scottish first minister added that ""this was never an opinion poll, it is not a scientific for or against independence.
""What it was was an SNP exercise to engage with the Scottish people on some of the issues around independence, and obviously we will take the time to analyse the responses we've had.""
When asked what the results showed, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I will tell you once it has concluded tomorrow.""
When she launched the initiative at an event in Stirling, Ms Sturgeon - the SNP leader and Scottish first minister - said she wanted to hear in detail how people felt about Europe, Brexit and independence.
Members of the public were invited to take part through a dedicated website, and the party's MPs and MSPs were also told to hold town hall meetings.
The SNP's 120,000 members were encouraged to ""hit the doorsteps"" to ask people to take part, and were sent a pack of ""survey cards"" which they would ask five people a month to fill in.
Data gathered during the exercise could be used by the SNP if Ms Sturgeon decides to call another referendum on leaving the UK.
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme at the weekend, the Scottish government's culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said she did not know whether the results of the survey would be published.
She said there had been a ""lot of interest"" from people who voted No in the independence referendum two years ago but were ""rethinking their position"" after voting Remain in the EU referendum.
When asked whether the results of the survey would be published, Ms Hyslop replied: ""I don't know because I'm not part of the party operation doing that.""
She also said: ""It is a listening exercise, it is a party exercise. I'm not running the consultation process"", and that she was ""expecting to have the results of what has come forth in some shape or form"".
Ms Sturgeon told the upper house of the Irish Parliament on Tuesday that another vote on independence remained ""firmly on the table"" if it was felt to be the best way of protecting Scotland's interests in the wake of the Brexit vote.
However, a YouGov poll for the Times newspaper that was published on Wednesday morning put support for independence at 44%, with 56% backing the Union.
Polling expert Prof John Curtice said it was the first time a poll had suggested support for independence had slipped from the 45% who voted Yes in the referendum in 2014.
The poll also suggested only 31% of people want the Scottish government to campaign for independence in the next two years, while 56% do not.
And respondents were asked about whether they think it would be ""realistically possible"" for Scotland to remain part of the EU after the rest of the UK leaves, regardless of their support for such a move.
Only 22% said they thought this would be ""probably possible"", with 62% saying ""probably not possible"" and 16% said they did not know.
And 13% said they had been contacted by the SNP as part of the national conversation survey while 82% said they had not.
YouGov polled 1,134 people from November 24-29.
It is the latest in a series of polls which have suggested the Brexit vote has not yet led to a surge in support for independence.
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said it was time for the SNP to ""finally pay heed to what Scotland is saying - 'no' to a second referendum and 'no' to more division, more uncertainty and more rancour"".
But an SNP spokesman pointed out that the poll suggested the SNP still has a commanding lead over the opposition in Holyrood voting intention, with the party on 48% in the constituency vote and 39% in the regional vote.
He added: ""That is a very strong endorsement of the party's record in office and of Nicola Sturgeon as first minister.""","The SNP's ""listening exercise"" on Scottish independence, which was announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September, is due to end.",38155720,xsum,"The Scottish National Party's ""national conversation"" exercise, aimed at engaging the Scottish public on issues related to independence, is believed to have been completed with an estimated 1.7 million participants.

Although Sturgeon has said that the survey was not an opinion poll, a recent YouGov poll for the Times newspaper suggested that support for independence had slipped to 44%, whilst 56% backed the Union.","The Scottish National Party (SNP) has said that around 2 million people may have participated in the party’s ‘national survey’ on Brexit and independence, though the number has since been reduced to 1.7 million.

9658,"SSAFA said there were more than 3,000 calls to Forcesline from serving troops last year, up from 1,600 in 2014.
The service was set up at the Army's request after four recruits died at its Deepcut Barracks in Surrey.
SSAFA said the rise in the number of calls ""although not a cause for panic, is reason for concern"".
The charity's chief executive, Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Those who serve in our armed forces are by their very nature resilient characters. They are then trained to be the most robust versions of themselves, so for some asking for help can be a real challenge.
""It is interesting that the service men and women who are contacting us are choosing to come to SSAFA, rather than their own chain of command, as the 'grin and bear it' attitude within the serving community remains strong.""
He said it was ""imperative"" that the welfare of service personnel welfare remained a priority and troops did not feel they had to ""deal with their issues on their own"".
""They have been there when our country has needed them and we must be there when they need us,"" he said.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""The government is absolutely committed to the wellbeing of our armed forces and provides a wide range of support both during and after service.
""We enshrined the armed forces covenant in law and have introduced a raft of measures designed to improve service life.
""The government works in close partnership with the service charitable sector on these issues and we value contributions such as this.""
SSAFA, formerly known as the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association, has a network of 7,000 volunteers providing support for serving personnel as well as veterans.
Between 1995 and 2002, four Army recruits died from gunshot wounds in unexplained circumstances at Deepcut, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse.
The Army said all of the deaths were suicides but, in each case, the families disagreed.
A second inquest is taking place into the death of one of those recruits, Private Cheryl James, more than 20 years after her death.
Among other things, the coroner will consider accusations that there were ""shortcomings"" with barracks policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young women, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.
In total, the SSAFA helpline received 21,983 requests for help in 2015, up 6% on the year before.","A confidential helpline has seen a nearly 90% increase in requests for help from serving military personnel, an armed forces charity has said.",35907701,xsum,"The UK's Armed Forces charity SSAFA has reported an increase in the number of calls to its helpline from serving soldiers, sailors and airmen over the past year, from 1,600 in 2014 to over 3,000 in 2015.

5404,"The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that 2,500 homes were repossessed in April, May and June, down from 3,000 in the previous quarter.
This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year.
Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise.
""This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular,"" said CML director general Paul Smee.
""As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening.""
Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home.
Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than Â£1.3 trillion.
The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year.
The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said.
Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance.
Ministry of Justice figures, also published on Thursday, show that the number of homeowners in England and Wales facing court action at the earliest stage of the repossession process fell during the second quarter of the year.
However, the number of tenants evicted by landlords in the second quarter of the year rose by 4% compared with the same period last year, to 10,361. Seasonally adjusted figures show a 1% decrease compared to the first three months of the year.
Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""These figures are a stark warning that relentless rent rises and welfare cuts have contributed to thousands of hard-pressed families losing their home.""",The number of homes repossessed in the UK fell again in the second quarter of the year as fewer owners fell behind on mortgage repayments.,33905314,xsum,"The number of UK homes being repossessed has dropped from 3,000 in the previous quarter to 2,500 in Q2, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML). This figure represents a significant reduction from the 5,400 homes that were repossessed during the same period last year, and is a welcome trend supported by low interest rates, which are helping to prevent low level arrears for stretched households, said CML director general Paul Smee.

8930,"Seventeen years ago, he was responsible for work at a particularly troublesome oil field in Kazakhstan.
""That oil field, Karazhanbas, was a real dog,"" he recalls, explaining that the oil there was very viscous, making it difficult to extract. ""Nobody wanted it.""
But Mr Barak and his colleagues persevered, drilling hundreds of wells. The field was later sold in 2005 for around $2bn (Â£1.5bn), he says.
Now, Mr Barak has turned his attention to the Wardlaw oil field in Edwards County, Texas. It lies in the southern corner of the Permian basin, a huge sedimentary basin in Texas and New Mexico that is associated with a high number of oil deposits.
But while there are an estimated 168 million barrels at Wardlaw, only around 120,000 have ever been extracted. That's what Mr Barak and his colleague Anatoly Bazhal, principal science coordinator, hope to change.
At Galex Energy Corporation, they have developed various technologies designed to dislodge hydrocarbons from the rock and move them to the surface.
One example of their innovations uses acoustic waves that are ""swept"", a process invented by Galex in which the waves are transmitted into oil-bearing rock surrounding the oil well.
Oil is trapped within that rock in tiny pores - the ""reservoir"" is more like a hard, wet sponge than an underground lake. To force oil out of the pores, the acoustic waves produce micro fractures in the rock that increase permeability.
The area is also exposed to cycles of low and high pressure. During low pressure cycles, the trapped oil droplets are impacted dramatically.
""The liquid bursts into vapour within the pore,"" explains Mr Barak. The pressure differential then encourages the hydrocarbons to flow towards the well where they can be drawn out of the ground.
Galex hopes to drill around 25 test wells this summer to measure the effectiveness of swept and other technologies it has developed.
But the process is not without risks. In a 2013 article Mr Barak and Mr Bazhal wrote, ""the unauthorized and incompetent use of [the] technology swept can cause damage to the subsoil environment, property and threat to the life of staff"".
Nevertheless, oil and gas companies are continuing to pursue new methods and techniques like this in order to get ever more fossil fuels out of the ground.
It's important to note that, traditionally, it has been commonplace for firms to recover only about a third of the oil from an oil field using existing techniques. But that is changing.
There are various reasons why new extraction methods are cropping up, but a key factor was the high price of oil in recent years - between roughly 2011 and 2014 the average price of a barrel was $100 or more.
""That period of time [when prices were high] allowed investments to be made in places such as very deep water in Brazil, Canadian sands and other parts of the world,"" explains Neil Atkinson, head of the International Energy Agency's oil industry and markets division.
In other words, the oil companies invested heavily in research and development at trickier sites, and in some cases are now benefiting from increased extraction.
An area long associated with oil production that some thought would have largely ""dried up"" by now is the North Sea, says Prof John Underhill at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland.
""More oil is being produced from those depleted fields than ever was thought possible when the North Sea was opened up,"" he says.
One new approach he cites is directional drilling, in which non-vertical wells are bored into the oil field.
""One can target those pockets of oil that would otherwise be left behind,"" he explains.
There have been innovations in injection too - the process of putting fluid into an oil reservoir to increase the pressure, helping it to flow through to the well.
At BP's major new site at Clair Ridge, off the coast of Shetland, chemistry will be harnessed to dislodge oil from the reservoir during injection.
The technique involved is called ""LoSal"". The oil in the Clair field clings to clay thanks to ions - atoms or molecules with an electric charge. They act a bit like a chain holding the hydrocarbons in place.
However, by lowering the salt content of the water in the reservoir, BP thinks this will make the chemical bonds of that chain relax.
If that happens, the ions may be replaced by less binding ones, releasing the hydrocarbons in the process. BP plans to begin production at Clair Ridge in 2018, and continue recovering oil from the field for the following 32 years.
The list of options for engineers vying to lure yet more oil from underground reservoirs is certainly growing.
Some firms, like Titan Oil Recovery in the US, are even enlisting the help of microbes, tiny organisms living within the oil field.
A sample of water in the field is sent to the lab for analysis, explains chairman and founder Ken Gerbino.
The goal is to find a microbe living there that can be fed and encouraged to proliferate. Once one is identified, Titan can deliver its - secret - formula.
""They multiply like crazy,"" says Mr Gerbino. The microbes, booming in number, surround globules of oil trapped in the porous rock.
""They physically deform the droplets into micro oil droplets,"" he explains. That means that the oil is more mobile and easier to recover.
""We've been on 48 commercial oil fields, we've done over 300 well applications, and the average increase in production has been 92%,"" he adds.
But microbial enhanced oil recovery, or MEOR as it is known, is not commonplace despite having been in development for many decades.
MrGerbino says his company's approach can cost as little as $6 per barrel, but the oil industry has long hesitated over MEOR techniques because of high costs and fears that microbial manipulation might not work as intended.
Of course, specialised techniques for encouraging oil towards the production well are one thing - simply locating pockets of oil suitable for extraction is another. This is no mean feat when, as in the North Sea, hundreds of smaller pools of oil are of course locked under the seafloor. Selecting which to aim for needs to be done carefully.
But augmented reality could soon help engineers decide which of these resources to earmark, according to Chris Pearson, small pools solution centre manager at the UK's recently opened Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC),
The OGTC is working with Aberdeen University to develop 3D visual representations of reservoirs - simulations of the oil field - based on data from geophysical surveys.
Artificial intelligence techniques can then predict what oil in that model is most recoverable and these evaluations can be represented within the 3D view.
""I'd call it augmented decision-making,"" says Pearson. ""It gives you a more informed view of what the reservoir looks like.""
For those in the oil industry right now, new technologies are just part of the excitement associated with high levels of both supply and demand.
They also play to many people's confidence that ""peak oil"" - when the maximum rate of oil extraction has been reached - is still a long way off.
And that, of course, is despite continued concerns that the fervour to extract more oil will lead to serious environmental problems - including, ultimately, a problematic contribution to climate change once those hydrocarbons are burned as fuel and emissions released.
But peak oil has certainly seemed more distant in recent times than it did, say, 10 years ago. The entrepreneurs and engineers behind new extraction technologies have plenty of faith that the status quo will continue - as does Neil Atkinson at the IEA.
""Oil production has been going up and up and up remorselessly for a very long time,"" he says, ""and it will continue to do so.""",Russian engineer Alex Barak has been coaxing oil out of the ground for a long time.,40580058,xsum,"Oil and gas companies are testing new methods and techniques to extract more fossil fuels from underground reservoirs.

Similarly, companies are also focusing on directional drilling into oil fields to extract previously missed pockets of oil. However, the increase of extraction poses environmental concerns, which including a further contribution to climate change.","Oil and gas companies are developing new extraction methods to get more fossil fuels out of the ground.

Innovations include non-vertical directional drilling and microbial enhanced oil recovery. Advances in augmented reality also allow engineers to identify pools of oil suitable for extraction. However, there are concerns about the environmental impact of attempts to extract ever more oil."
1863,"Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.
His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
""It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,"" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as ""a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend"".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.

But experts say that, with Ebola cases falling, it may be difficult to establish whether the jab offers any protection against the virus.
It has been produced by British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the US National Institutes of Health.
GSK said a plane carrying some 300 initial doses of the vaccine was expected to arrive in Monrovia on Friday.
And the company hopes the first volunteer will be immunised in the next few weeks.
The chief executive of GSK, Sir Andrew Witty, said the pace of development was almost unparalleled and was comparable to only the development of a pandemic flu vaccine or new medicines for HIV.
He told the BBC: ""As an example we have delayed two other vaccine development programmes to free up the space to do this work, so this has come with a significant amount of disruption.""
Scientists aim to involve 30,000 volunteers in the trial in total, including frontline health workers.
If all regulations are met, 10,000 volunteers will be given the GSK vaccine.
A matching number will get a placebo, dummy vaccine. And there are plans for a further 10,000 people to get a separate experimental jab.
The results will be compared to see if either vaccine offers any meaningful protection against the virus.
A version of the vaccine has already been tested on 200 healthy volunteers across the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali.
GSK says it has been found to have an acceptable safety profile so far.
But it is only in affected countries that experts can determine whether it provides adequate protection against the virus.
Dr Moncef Slaoui, of GlaxoSmithKline said: ""Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine.
""The initial phase one data we have seen are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing.""
The company stresses the vaccine is still in development and the World Health Organization, and other regulators, would have to be satisfied the vaccine is both safe and effective before any mass immunisation campaigns could be considered.
Field trials of other promising vaccines - for example one involving the company Merck - are planned in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the months to come.
And there are reports that a trial of an experimental drug called Zmapp might start in the next few weeks.
However, experts say with the number of Ebola cases falling opportunities to test vaccines and drugs could be limited.
Prof Jonathan Ball, a virus expert based at Nottingham University, told the BBC: ""Because case numbers are starting to come down it will become harder and harder to show if the vaccine is having any impact.
""Ultimately we may be in position in a few months time where we don't know whether this vaccine is effective in humans.

6646,"Of these 216 planets, 10 of them could potentially be home to some sort of life, because they are 'Earth-like'.
This means they have 'rocky' characteristics, and they are located in the 'Goldilocks Zone' of their solar system.
If a planet is in a 'Goldilocks Zone' it is not too hot or too cold, which means water can be in its liquid form there.
The Kepler Telescope has made some amazing discoveries since it was launched in 2009, but here are the top five findings...
In 2014 the telescope made a huge discovery by finding a planet nicknamed: 'Earth 2.0'.
The planet called, Kepler-452b has been dubbed as 'Earth 2.0', because it shares many characteristics with our Earth, even though it is 1,400 light years away from us.
The first potentially habitable planet the telescope found was Kepler-22b, way back in 2011.
Scientists agreed the planet was could be liveable because it was the perfect distance from its sun.
In April 2017 the telescope found a super-Earth.
This is a planet called LHS 1140b. It is a good candidate for life and orbits a red dwarf star 40 light years away.
However, scientists think the planet might have had an ocean made entirely out of magma! - which released steam into the atmosphere.
In February 2017, Kepler discovered seven new Earth-sized exoplanets.
Exoplanets are planets that orbit a different star to our Sun - in a different solar system to the one we are in.
In 2011 Nasa discovered the first planet to orbit two suns!
It is called Kepler-16b, and is roughly 200 light years away from Earth.
Some scientists have compared it to Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine, from the Star Wars movies, which also had two suns.","Nasa's Kepler telescope has recently found 216 new planets, meaning it has now discovered more than 4000 potential new worlds!",40344938,xsum,"The Kepler Telescope has discovered 216 planets, 10 of which are potentially habitable because they are Earth-like, rocky and found in the Goldilocks Zone.

5429,"They want President Dmitry Medvedev to be confronted over a perceived failure to protect business against corruption.
In a Sunday Times letter, they also call for the PM to raise the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.
The call is from Labour's Margaret Beckett, David Miliband, Jack Straw and Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind.
The letter says hundreds of thousands of Russian businessmen are detained in jails after falling victim to corruption sanctioned by the authorities.
They refer to these people as ""victims of an increasingly potent mix of corruption and lawlessness"".
In their letter, the former foreign secretaries state: ""The dangers of this corruption do not stop at Russia's borders and Alexander Litvinenko's murder shows the consequences of such lawlessness hitting British shores.
""In this regard the prime minister has both a domestic and international duty to tackle this issue head on during his visit.""
Mr Cameron is flying to Moscow on Sunday in an attempt to improve relations with Mr Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Strained relations
He will be the first UK prime minister to visit the Russian capital since Tony Blair six years ago.
Whitehall officials recently revealed that no UK minister or diplomat has spoken directly with Mr Putin for four years.
The BBC's James Landale said the prime minister was expected to see Mr Putin but a formal meeting had not been confirmed.
Relations between the UK and Russia have been strained since the murder of Mr Litvinenko, an ex-Russian security official who had been living in the UK.
Litvinenko killing suspect speaks out
Mr Litvinenko - an outspoken Kremlin critic - was fatally poisoned. His death led to both the UK and Russia expelling diplomats.
The 43-year-old was found to have been poisoned with radioactive polonium-210.
Moscow has refused a long-standing request from the UK to extradite the prime suspect in the case, Andrei Lugovoi, a former KGB officer who is now a member of the Russian Parliament and has always denied involvement.
In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, Mr Lugovoi suggested a third country should be brought in to re-investigate the murder in an attempt to break the diplomatic deadlock, and suggested MI6 - and even Mr Litvinenko himself - had been behind the killing.
There have also been tensions over Russia's attempts to shut down the British Council's offices in Moscow.
The UK government's refusal to co-operate and share intelligence since the scandal has harmed counter-terrorism efforts, according to Alexander Yakovenko, Moscow's ambassador in London.

5269,"Wolves started brightly and Nouha Dicko gave them the lead, beating Rob Green with a low first-time shot on the run.
Leeds turned up the pressure after the break, but Andy Lonergan saved from Souleymane Doukara and Kortney Hause cleared off the line to keep it 1-0.
Fulham's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday's 2-1 victory at QPR sees Leeds drop into seventh place.
Despite losing their past two Championship matches, Wolves dominated the opening exchanges, with Green having to come out quickly and make a low save one-on-one from Andreas Weimann.
Dave Edwards forced another Green stop and Dicko went close, cutting inside and firing narrowly wide before the goal their pressure deserved finally came.
The 24-year-old striker latched onto Ben Marshall's clever through-ball behind the defence and found the bottom corner before Green could set himself.
Leeds rallied, but Pontus Jansson could not hit the target with a free header and Lonergan produced a reflex save to keep out Doukara's header from Kemar Roofe's cutback.
Wolves sat back and invited pressure, with Hause clearing Roofe's looping header off the line from a corner and Chris Wood heading over late on, but the away side hung on to claim the points.
The win secures Wolves' Championship status for another season on 54 points, while Leeds' third loss in five games puts them out of the play-offs on goal difference with three matches remaining.

10195,"It is a special place, and it will be full of Real Madrid fans screaming their side on, so it is vital Manchester City handle the occasion as much as the opposition on Wednesday.
I know only too well what can go wrong for them in their Champions League semi-final second leg, because I was part of a Tottenham team that lost 4-0 there in the quarter-finals in 2011.
But I believe City's players when they say they are confident, and they are right to be.
The atmosphere will be intense and intimidating, and City also have to face a Real side containing some of the best players in the world, but they have the experience and the ability to handle all of that.
The likes of goalkeeper Joe Hart and captain Vincent Kompany were not just pretending when they were very positive about City's chances after the first leg finished 0-0.
I was the same when I faced the media before our game against Real.
I was not unaware of the size of the task we faced, but what I said was in response to the media trying to paint a picture of fear with their questions about the tie.
They were very much along the lines of, 'Are you lot ready for this?' and, 'Are you nervous?'
Like Hart, my reaction was, 'No, I am not afraid. I am looking forward to it.' I had been watching big Champions League games for years and now I was about to play in one myself.
Media playback is not supported on this device
I don't think anyone expected us to win but we genuinely were not afraid because we had been to the San Siro twice already that year as part of our amazing run to the last eight and, in Gareth Bale, we had a kid who had been ripping Europe apart.
For different reasons, City will also have a lot of optimism going into the tie.
This is their first semi-final but they have got a lot more Champions League experience than that Tottenham team, including two trips to the Nou Camp in the past two seasons.
The more times you are in those situations, the more you learn about how to deal with them.
Four of the City team likely to start on Wednesday - Hart, Kompany, Gael Clichy and Yaya Toure, came within minutes of beating Real at the Bernabeu in 2012 when they led twice but lost to an injury-time Cristiano Ronaldo goal.
And in Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas they have players who went there many times in La Liga when they played for Atletico Madrid and Sevilla.
They will be ready for the Bernabeu, and they certainly will not be scared.
City boss Manuel Pellegrini was spot on before the first leg when he said his players could not afford to lose their heads, and remembering that will be crucial for them on Wednesday.
We conceded early against Real, but it was a far bigger blow to our chances when Peter Crouch was sent off after being booked twice in the first 14 minutes, because our game plan went out of the window.
Part of the problem is you get so pumped up for these matches and it is hard to contain that emotion.
I only found out I was playing less than five minutes before kick-off because Aaron Lennon was unwell but I just remember walking out of the tunnel being more excited than anything else.
City players also have to remember that officials will feel the pressure of the Bernabeu crowd as much as the players, and a lot of decisions are more likely to go Real's way.
There is a difference in mentality too, because Spanish teams look at an opposition red card as a way of changing the course of the game to gain advantage.
It is a viable way of winning for them and they will do it again on Wednesday if they can, so City will have to be super clever to avoid that situation this time.
If you look at games between English and Spanish sides in the Champions League over the past 10 seasons, it is the English teams who have had far more players sent off - 11 red cards, compared to six.
No team - Spanish or English - has won any of those 16 games after going down to 10 men, and I don't think that would change if it happened to City this time.
When it happened to Spurs at the Bernabeu, it turned into the hardest and weirdest game I have ever played in, because we just never got the ball.
I was over on the right of a midfield diamond and Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo were running at me and Spurs right-back Vedran Corluka, although sometimes they just overloaded us with three or four players.
It was relentless - wave after wave of attacks from all angles, and in an electric atmosphere too because the crowd were in a frenzy.
Corluka and I just looked at each other at one point, because we did not know what to do. You looked round for help but everyone else was exhausted too.
If City can keep any kind of control in the game, they can take the positive effects of playing in the Bernabeu away from Real and use it against them.
The longer it stays 0-0, the better it is for City and their first aim should be to keep the home crowd quiet, then get them on the Real players' backs.
Real were sitting deep for most of the first leg but they cannot do that at home because they will get absolutely slaughtered by their supporters.
They have to attack and try to win the game and that will leave massive spaces for Kevin de Bruyne and Aguero to do what they did in the quarter-final, when City really exploited Paris St-Germain's expansive style and drew 2-2 in Paris.
The tie is in the balance at 0-0 after the first leg but City will be happier with that result because away goals are so important, and playing away from the Etihad seems to suit them a lot better in European competition anyhow.
They are capable of scoring as well as shutting Real out and I think they have the players to go there and win the game.
Jermaine Jenas was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan",It is very hard not to be overawed when you step out on to the pitch at the Bernabeu for the first time and look around you - the stadium just keeps going up and up for what feels like forever.,36198711,xsum,"Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas has called on Manchester City to handle the pressure of the Santiago Bernabeu in the same way as Real Madrid in Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final second leg.

However, he believes City’s experience in the Champions League and visits to other hostile grounds such as Barcelona mean that they will be prepared. Jenas has also warned City to keep their heads for the duration of the match in Madrid in order to avoid losing their game plan and also seeing red cards from the official, who themselves may be affected by the Bernabeu atmosphere.

 
","Former Tottenham player Jermaine Jenas has advised Manchester City to stay clam during the upcoming semi-final in the Bernabeu tonight. He warns that officials are as susceptible to the pressure of the Bernabeu crowd as the players, and that too much emotion can cause a player to 'lose their head', such as the situation where Peter Crouch was red carded in the opening minutes in Tottenham's match against Real in 2011.

6838,"Based on a true story, Pride shows how gay rights campaigners from London raised thousands of pounds for miners in the Dulais Valley, after the NUM had spurned their support.
Despite initial scepticism on both sides, the characters break down preconceptions and strike an enduring friendship.
Starring Bill Nighy, Dominic West and Imelda Staunton, the movie played to critical acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival this summer.
But, according to writer Stephen Beresford, it's a tale which had almost been airbrushed out of collective gay history.
""It was in the early 1990s, during the second round of pit closures, when I first heard about it,"" he said.
""As a naÃ¯ve 21-year-old, I asked the question: Why should we support the miners? They don't support us.
""Someone took me aside and said: 'Let me tell you a little story'.
""I suppose the film's been in the making ever since.""
The film opens with gay activist Mike Jackson at the Pride march in 1984, looking for a cause to support.
He persuades his friends that ""The miners are hated by Thatcher, the police, and the tabloid pressâ€¦who does that remind you of?"", adding ""The only thing we have to worry about which they don't is Mary Whitehouse, and that's only a matter of time""
Indeed, in real life it wasn't long until The Sun turned its moral indignation on the unlikely alliance as they branded a joint fundraising concert 'Pits and Perverts'.
But Mike quickly discovers that, in the beginning at least, not all the miners are entirely comfortable with the solidarity offered by 'Lesbians and Gays Support Miners'.
Christine Powell was treasurer of The Neath and District Miners Support Group, and recalls the first time LGSM visited Wales.
""Well we were nervous, not about them, but about ourselves.  We didn't know anything about gay people, none of us had ever knowingly met one, and we were just desperate not to say or do anything which was going to offend them - especially after they'd been so kind and supportive to us.
""But from the first minute they had us in stitches, and we soon realised that we had far more things in common than there were which separated us.
""Before that I suppose we'd been quite prejudiced, through ignorance.
""One of the good things to come out of the strike was that it forced us to be less judgemental about things we didn't understand, and realise that there are friends everywhere if you're happy to accept them.""

Ms Moore said: ""It sends a message to staff that choose to abuse patients in their care that it is fine, it's just a slap on the wrist - you can carry on doing what you are doing.""
In May 2012, 43-year-old Mr Clarke, of West Kingsdown, Kent, suffered a devastating brain haemorrhage, leaving him  paralysed down his left side, doubly incontinent and unable to swallow or communicate.
He was admitted to the West Kent Neuro Rehabilitation unit, run by the Kent & Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust.
But Ms Moore was so worried about him, she set up a secret camera next to his bed to monitor his treatment.
Footage showing Mr Clarke's mistreatment was subsequently broadcast by the BBC.
It showed his feeding tube being cleaned with a ballpoint pen and his emergency buzzer being taken away.
'Doesn't care'
The Nursing and Midwifery Council suspended staff nurse Vanessa Kennard from practice for 12 months.
In its last communication with Ms Kennard, the tribunal heard she was not interested in the case and ""doesn't care what happens"".
The case against her on 10 counts, including the removal of Mr Clarke's buzzer, continued in her absence.
Deputy ward manager Marie Banwell received a caution order for 18 months. She had admitted 13 charges but denied nine others.
Ward manager Sarah Coulter admitted 13 charges but denied four others. She has been given a caution order for 12 months.

10526,"Out of nowhere, he became the country's most talked-about man and was on the run until he appeared in an online video on 5 July vowing to keep up his attacks on the government.
President Nicolás Maduro has declared him a terrorist, accusing him of stealing a military helicopter and dropping grenades on the court to mount a coup.
Here is what we know about him so far.
Now in his mid-30s, Oscar Pérez has been a member of the forensic police force, known as the CICPC, for 15 years.
The Venezuelan media emphasise that he is a highly trained agent, part of the Special Actions Brigade (BAE), where he is chief of operations for the Air Force division.
The president said he once worked as a pilot for the ex-minister of interior and justice, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, who, according to Mr Maduro, has been plotting a coup against him.
The ex-minister called the accusations ""nonsense"", according to local media.
The government has also accused Mr Pérez of having ties to the United States, specifically the CIA, which it also often says is trying to overthrow it.
As yet, Mr Pérez has no confirmed links with any international or domestic groups, although he has claimed to be part of an anti-government coalition of military, police and civilians.
On the day of the attack, Mr Pérez posted a series of video statements on his Instagram account, calling people to rise up ""to recuperate our beloved Venezuela"".
The posts suggest someone who is prepared to put himself under public scrutiny.
He appears flanked by four armed, masked men, and stares squarely at the camera to read his message.
Beyond this, he has laid bare the rest of his life in more than 900 posts on the social network. Or at least he has laid out the curated life he wants to present to the world: a self-styled action man.
He poses with large guns and helicopters. He is seen practising self-defence moves and scuba-diving.
In January he was even pictured scuba-diving while brandishing a high-calibre weapon underwater. It was captioned, ""We prepare ourselves, so that there are no limits. Venezuela is a single nation.""
In another, he shows off his skills by shooting a target over his shoulder, behind his back, using only a make-up mirror as a guide.
But he is also shown patting police dogs and hugging child cancer patients.
Alongside pictures of hospitalised children, he comments on the medicine shortages that have been gripping the country.
Earlier this year, the national medical federation said that hospitals had less than 5% of the medicines they needed.
The president has blamed the problem on an economic war against his government and the sharp fall in oil prices, but his critics blame his mismanagement.
Mr Pérez has also worked as an actor and film producer.
In 2015, he played a role in Venezuelan film, Suspended Death, which tells the story of elite police officers rescuing the victim of a kidnapping.
In a promotional interview with local media, he described his own life in bombastic terms: ""I am a helicopter pilot, a combat diver and a free parachutist. I am also a father, a companion and an actor ... I am a man who goes out without knowing if he will return home because death is part of evolution.""
Before the attack on Tuesday, he posted a picture - without any commentary - of a painting by contemporary US artist Jon McNaughton.
It shows a glorified Jesus Christ surrounded by dozens of soldiers from different eras, and is titled 'Peace is Coming'.","Who is Oscar Pérez, the police officer who launched a helicopter attack on the Venezuelan Supreme Court on 27 June?",40429867,xsum,"Oscar Pérez, accused of flying a stolen helicopter over Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, and dropping grenades on the supreme court and interior ministry, has become the country’s most talked-about man.

58,"Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995.
Her parents said a dispute over the ballistics evidence could only be resolved if her body is exhumed.
Coroner Brian Barker QC said he would wait for a doctor's report before he made the decision.
He told the pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court that exhumation was a ""difficult and unusual"" step.
Alison Foster QC, representing Pte James' family, said her relatives were ""really dismayed to be at this point today"".
""From our standpoint, an exhumation would be necessary for you to carry out a full and proper inquiry.""
Bullet fragments in Pte James' body were yellow, while the SA80 rifle she was armed with used red bullets, Ms Foster said.
""There is no actual evidence that it was an SA80 that caused the bullet wound to Cheryl,"" she added.
The coroner said the full inquest on 1 February would consider whether there were ""shortcomings"" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation.
Another pre-inquest hearing is to held on 10 September.
Pte James was one of four soldiers found dead at Deepcut, in Camberley, between 1995 and 2002.
Surrey Police's request that her inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down.
A spokeswoman for the force said: ""[Surrey Police] has now completed the review of disclosure documents relating to Pte James.""
She said arrangements for the inquest were a matter for the coroner.
""Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into circumstances surrounding the death of Pte James and our thoughts remain with her family.""","The family of a soldier found dead at Deepcut Barracks has urged a coroner to let her body be exhumed so a ""full inquiry"" can be held into her death.",32802672,xsum,"The parents of Pte Cheryl James, who was found dead with a bullet wound to her head in 1995, have requested that her body is exhumed as part of an inquest into her death.

3960,"The annual celebratory march, now in its 43rd year, stopped for a minute to remember the victims shot dead in a gay nightclub in Orlando.
The parade got under way in the West End with an increased visible police presence.
For the first time, the Red Arrows will fly past the march and a rainbow flag is flying at Parliament.
Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, announced she is in a same-sex relationship as the event was in full swing.
She tweeted: ""Today's a good day to say I'm in a happy same sex relationship, I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!""
Her announcement came as the director of Pride London, Michael Salter-Church, said this year's campaign slogan is No Filter.
He said: ""No Filter is a call to arms. A call for people to be themselves, to live as their true selves.
""Now that might sound too obvious but too many people already self-censor. On this weekend whilst we celebrate the LGBT community, be your true selves, try and live without filter because that's a really important message that we want spread around the UK and the world.""
London Mayor Sadiq Khan also joined the celebratory parade and singer Alesha Dixon will entertain revellers.
In a message before the march, he said London is ""a city where the large majority of people of all communities, faiths and backgrounds, don't simply tolerate each other, but respect, embrace and celebrate our diversity"".
At the scene: BBC reporter Catriona Renton
What a carnival atmosphere!
The buzz around the start of the parade was electric as we watched several people dressed as the character of Patsy from ""Absolutely Fabulous"" dancing on their bus with a giant high heeled shoe and lipstick on it.
Then the real stars of the show Edina and Patsy herself cut the ribbon. Then they were off.
Approximately 40,000 people from around 300 organisations paraded down Oxford Street in a sea of glitter and colour on their way to Trafalgar Square.
There was silence as people here paused to remember the 49 victims of the shootings in Orlando who were killed two weeks ago. The message was of solidarity.
The march takes place weeks after a gunman shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida.
The Metropolitan Police said it will mount a visible police presence to provide reassurance to those taking part.
Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe earlier said there was ""no intelligence"" to suggest the march or the city would be targeted, urging people to join in but ""take reasonable precaution"".
Organisers expect that more people will attend the event this year to show support for the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community.
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who was involved in organising the first Pride, said people must unite against hate and this year both gay and straight Muslims will join the parade in a show of solidarity.
He said: ""In the wake of the horrific mass murder of LGBT people by an Islamist gunman in Orlando, we are highlighting the need for dialogue, unity and solidarity between the Muslim and LGBT communities - to oppose all hate.""

"
1204,"""I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared,"" said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter.
But the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out.
Ms Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine.
Undaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world.
Beauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila.
Opposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted.
The recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further.
Mr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive.
""In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family,"" he said. ""These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition.""
One of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator.
He and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally.
Mr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals.
In scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and ""the beauty of face"" were most important.
But training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said.
Ms Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense.
""There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist,"" she said.
One exercise was called the ""duck walk"" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. ""Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall,"" she said.
And despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant Q&A, as well as advice from former pageant winners.
Like Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles.
She did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included ""doing weird lunges and wiggling"".
Sian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum ""begged me to, so I joined a local one"".
She joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010.
They were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow.
""In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal,"" she said.
""The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing,"" Ms Maynard said.
But she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she ""didn't even know or bother to comb my hair"".
""So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips,"" Ms Maynard said.
Sometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors.
""And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know, 'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?'
""It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work,"" said Ms Maynard, now 27.
Even the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said. He helps pick the right outfits and involves himself with how a candidate ""should sway on stage"". He even helps pick a candidate's lipstick shade - anything to help improve her chances. He said mentors tried to build on a candidate's natural traits, such as whether to cultivate a sweet or sexy image.
Some mentors do charge for their services, but most like Mr Gaffud do it ""for the love of finding a girl"".
""This is a side project,"" he said, adding that mentors help pay for the candidate's make-up, pictorials, food and sometimes even their rent.
Some mentors, however, go on to manage their beauty queen's careers after they are successful in pageants.
""They don't expect us to pay for anything, which I just find really amazing,"" said Ms Seifert, ""because these pageant aficionados have full-time jobs, but they really dedicate so much of themselves to helping us develop and train,"" she said.
Becoming a beauty queen is not always glamorous, Ms Seifert cautioned. ""The moment I got crowned was the moment all the hard work began,"" she said.
In her case, being a Miss Philippines-Earth winner and Miss Earth runner-up meant many public appearances to promote environmental causes.
Pageant winners have high public profiles in the Philippines, and winning a title is seen as coming with big responsibilities. As ""an important public figure"", it was important to set a good example to young girls who looked up to beauty queens, Ms Seifert said.
Winners are feted, introduced to high-ranking officials, and often recognised on the street and asked to pose for photographs.
Anjo Lorenzana, a lecturer from the Ateneo de Manila University who specialises in media and popular culture, said pageants were also an opportunity for the Philippines to promote its image on an international stage.
""By winning international beauty contests, Filipinos, who are usually equated with lowly occupations, can be seen in a better light,"" he said.
For the candidates, pageants can be a stepping stone for upward social or economic mobility, Jose Wendell Capili said.
He added that Filipinos were deeply passionate about pageants, pointing to heated online discussions. ""Rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes break up families, friendships and relationships,"" he said.
Tammy David, who has been photographing pageants since 2007, said the most unusual pageant she shot was inside a large jail.
""You could see how parents were proud because their daughter was Little Miss Bureau of Corrections,"" Ms David said. ""Beauty pageants are everywhere.""","Sandra Seifert is tall, pretty, smart and articulate, but it took a while for her to decide she wanted to take part in a beauty pageant in the Philippines.",25550425,xsum,"Beauty pageants have become big business in the Philippines, fueled by a culture of celebrity and a desire for upward mobility, both qualities embodied by winners of the contests. Competitors sometimes spend years training for national contests, battling prejudice and scrutiny, working on their interviews and practicing walking and swaying in four-inch heels. The winners are celebrated and their public appearances are closely choreographed - opportunities to promote themselves and their sponsors months after they have been crowned.
","Beauty pageants are extremely popular in the Philippines, with many young women training at so-called beauty camps to prepare for national and international competitions. Height and facial beauty are important, but talent scouts and modelling agencies train the candidates extensively for months, including exercises to tone the body, hair and make-up, and public speaking. Winning a beauty pageant can bring high public profiles and career opportunities, but it also comes with responsibilities to promote environmental causes and set a positive example. Success in international beauty contests has become a source of national pride for Filipinos, but rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes lead to heated discussions and even break up families and friendships."

10594,"""If I'd been in her shoes, I would have sacked me too,"" he told the BBC.
Mr Gove said he regretted standing for the Tory leadership, saying he made ""mistakes"" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson.
He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as ""doing a Gove"", he said.
The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday.
He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to ""make a contribution"" in the future.
Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a ""significant strain"" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron.
He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a ""proper conversation"" since the 23 June poll, he said.
Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson.
He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job.
Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that ""the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way"".
""As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made...
""I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.""
After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches.
""When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too,"" said Mr Gove.
""So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do.
""I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did.""
But he conceded that ""nothing is forever in politics"".
""I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.""

9264,"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country.
Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda.
That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016.
Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines.
Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia.
A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres.
The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help.
Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road.
I asked him what they had left behind.
""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me.
The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun.
""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave.
""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.""
Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan.
The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer.
Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital.
In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said.
""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.""

Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees.
With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops.
Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground.
The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house.
In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres.
But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach.
""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda.
""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.""
He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in.
As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit.

Uganda: 'One of the best places to be a refugee'","For three years South Sudan has tumbled deeper into self-inflicted chaos, and it now finds itself on the brink of something even more terrifying.",38328811,xsum,"Ethnic violence in South Sudan has triggered the world's biggest refugee crisis, more than in Syria, as 340,000 people have fled into neighbouring Uganda since violence broke out in July. Refugees fleeing allege rape, murder and targeting of civilians based on tribal identity. The Ugandan government is struggling to cope with the continuing influx of refugees, and supplies of water and food are becoming an issue. The UN has suggested that the scale of violence in South Sudan means that ethnic cleansing and even genocide could result.  
","The United Nations officials say that South Sudan's crisis could potentially be classified as ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" as violence continues to spread throughout the country, with more than 340,000 people fleeing to Uganda.

Testimonies from those fleeing tell stories of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines.

3158,"Security experts warn that African governments and commercial online services are vulnerable to criminals, who have the potential to disrupt critical infrastructure.
But critics say that these laws could also be used to clamp down on the use of online platforms that promote good governance, express dissent and mobilize citizen engagement.
The measures have not only been implemented in countries known for strict media controls such as Ethiopia, but are also being introduced in democracies such as Kenya and South Africa.
While rising internet use is driving the rapid growth of the digital economy and enhancing access to information and government services in Africa, it has also exposed users to new and sophisticated threats.
The two largest economies in Africa - South Africa and Nigeria - are each estimated to lose $500m (Â£375m) annually to cyber criminals, according to a 2016 McAfee report.
In addition, African governments are fighting against local and international hacktivist groups who have carried out several disruptive attacks in recent years.
Anonymous Africa claimed responsibility for several attacks that targeted the website of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) in July over the broadcaster's ban on broadcasting violent protests.
The group also shut down the website of the Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF in support of anti-government protests.
Many African governments have appeared unprepared for these threats and are now racing to tighten their telecom laws.
With social media platforms being used to organise political activity, the continent's political elite seems worried that such platforms could be used to foment revolt.
In the past months, authorities in Uganda, Gabon, Chad, Burundi and Congo-Brazzaville have shut down internet services during disputed elections, raising fears that more governments could take similar measures.
Over the past year, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Angola, Madagascar and Zimbabwe have passed or proposed stringent laws to fight real and imagined threats.
South Africa has been accused of proposing ""Africa's worst new internet censorship law"".
The draft Films and Publications Amendment Bill seeks to ""protect the public and children"", but critics say its vague language and definitions  will ""stifle the empowering, democratising potential of the internet"" and scare away potential business investors.
In June, Ethiopia passed the Computer Crime Proclamation, which criminalises defamatory speech, spam and pornography, among other offences, with jail sentences of up to 10 years.
Activists say it could also be used to silence government critics, who are reliant on online publishing due to the country's rigid media controls.
In Nigeria, journalists and bloggers have criticised the 2015 Cyber Crime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act, saying it has been used by politicians to curtail freedom of expression. Two prominent bloggers have been arrested on allegations of ""cyber stalking"" under the Act.
Kenya is preparing legislation to curb cyber crime and regulate social media, and has been accused of plotting to use the law to shut down social media. The government already has a history of going after internet users: Among Kenyan social media users arrested in 2015 was a prominent blogger accused of insulting the president.
Kenyan officials have also blamed ""the spread of hate speech"" on unregulated social media use. The law is expected to be implemented before the August 2017 general elections.
The Zimbabwe government, long intolerant of dissent, is planning to pass a law which has been criticised for banning the use of anti-censorship software. The proposed law also outlaws social media groups based on racial or tribal identity.
Information Minister Supa Mandiwanzira said there was a need to pass laws that protect internet users against defamation and hacking, but the Matabeleland Institute for Human Rights urged parliament and citizens to defend human rights ""as it grossly violates human rights"".
While these laws provide a legal framework to fight cyber crime and control the dissemination of hate speech, they could also provide a basis for authoritarian regimes to intimidate their rivals.
In June, Isaac Habakuk Emily from northern Tanzania was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of insulting President John Magufuli in a Facebook post contrary to the country's CyberCrime Act of 2015. He is said to have referred to the president as an ""imbecile"".
Tanzanian law allows for a minimum fine of 3m shillings ($1,375; Â£1,000) and minimum jail term of three months for publishing false, deceptive or misleading information on a computer system.
In Zimbabwe, spokesperson for the People First party, Jealousy Mawarire, was last month charged over a tweet accusing Education Minister Jonathan Moyo of financial impropriety.
With the cybercrime bill still in the draft stage, he was charged under the old Posts and Telecommunications Act, which outlaws the sending ""by telephone any message that is grossly offensive or is of an indecent, obscene or threatening character"".
In Nigeria, the Bauchi State authorities arrested Musa Azare, a journalist and blogger in June on allegations of ""cyber stalking"" the governor. This came shortly after another blogger, Abubakar Sadiq, was arrested by the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) on similar charges. In both cases, the bloggers were critical of the authorities.
African nations are far from alone in attempts to control the internet. However, stifling discourse as it emerges as a crucial medium on the continent poses worrying questions regarding freedom of speech.

7050,"Gaby Scanlon, of Heysham, Lancashire, was served the Nitro-Jagermeister while celebrating her 18th birthday in 2012.
Oscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster previously admitted health and safety failings, at Preston Crown Court.
The court heard Ms Scanlon was left close to death after drinking the £3.95 shot.
She was taken to Lancaster Royal Infirmary, where a CT scan found a large perforation in her stomach.
Ms Scanlon, now 20, spent three weeks in hospital, undergoing surgery to remove her stomach and connect her oesophagus directly to her small bowel.
Her solicitors told the court the experience, on 4 October 2012, had ""completed changed"" her life.
She now suffers from ""episodes of agonising pain"", has to avoid some foods and can no longer enjoy eating, they said.
Describing the moment she drank the shot, Ms Scanlon told the court: ""I turned to the man and asked if it was okay to drink. He said 'Yes'.
""Smoke was coming from my nose and mouth.  Straight away I knew something was not right.  My stomach expanded.""
Oscar's Wine Bar Ltd, registered in Swinton, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to one count of failing in the duty of an employer to ensure the safety of persons not in its employment, admitting it failed to ensure the shot cocktail was safe for consumption.
No risk assessment was carried out regarding the potential dangers of the drinks.
The firm's director Andrew Dunn, of Old Earswick, York, pleaded not guilty to his part in the company's failings.
The prosecution said it would offer no evidence against him if he made a £20,000 contribution to the court costs prior to sentencing.
A spokesman for Lancaster City Council said: ""We took the view that in the public interest it was not necessary to prosecute Mr Dunn, taking into account the interests of the family.""
Passing sentence, Judge Pamela Badley said the bar's actions ""fell very far short of standards"".
Liquid nitrogen was present in the Nitro-Jagermeister shot to create a cloud of smoke in the glass.
While such drinks are not illegal, physicists say the liquid must completely evaporate before the drink is safe for consumption.
The court heard the bar had sold a range of cocktails using the chemical after Mr Dunn saw similar drinks in the Berkeley Hotel in London.
He was said to have found them ""alluring and intrigued by the dramatic effect"".
But senior health and safety officer Peter Lord, who visited the bar in May 2012, said he had concerns about the drinks and sent a letter with guidance on liquid nitrogen usage, which was met with no response.
The family-run bar's barrister Kevin McLoughlin said the family had been left ""mortified"" and apologised to Miss Scanlon and her family for the ""errors and misjudgements that were made"".
He said: ""The company and the family are truly sorry.  At no time did they see anything warning them of the risks of ingestion.
""The essence of this calamity was the ignorance on the part of the company.""","A wine bar has been fined £100,000 after a woman drank a cocktail containing liquid nitrogen and had to have her stomach removed.",34277429,xsum,"A UK bar has been fined £100,000 over an incident where a customer was left with her stomach removed after drinking a cocktail containing liquid nitrogen.

1836,"Marks, from Kenfig Hill, Bridgend county, announced last year he had been diagnosed with inoperable bowel cancer.
Jailed in the US in 1990 after being convicted of smuggling cannabis, he recalled his exploits in a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, which was later made into a film starring Rhys Ifans.
The father of four stood for election to Parliament in 1997 on a single-issue ticket of reforming cannabis laws.
Marks also regularly toured a one-man show in which he recounted stories about drug smuggling and his time in prison.
The life of 'Mr Nice' Howard Marks
No regrets as Marks lives with cancer
A statement said: ""In the early hours of 10th April 2016, Howard Marks died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by his four loving children.
""He fought the illness with grace and humour.
""His death was 21 years to the day since his release from prison in the United States, his second bout of imprisonment for cannabis smuggling since his miraculous acquittal at the Old Bailey in 1980.
""One of his last acts was to set up the Mr Nice foundation, to ensure the causes dear to him continue to receive his support.""
Revealing his illness in January 2015, Marks said he had ""no regrets"" about his life.
His drug smuggling began in the 1970s after he graduated from Oxford University with a degree in physics.
In 1988, he was arrested in Spain as part of a US Drug Enforcement Agency-led operation and extradited to Florida. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison and released on parole in 1995 for good behaviour.
As well as the film version of Mr Nice, Marks had cameo roles in the movie Human Traffic and appeared on TV including on the BBC quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.
He also collaborated on songs with the Super Furry Animals and made appearances at the Glastonbury festival.
A sequel to Mr Nice, Senor Nice, came out in 2006, and five years later Marks published a crime novel, Sympathy for the Devil.",Former drug smuggler turned author Howard Marks has died at the age of 70.,36012026,xsum,"Howard Marks, a Welsh drug smuggler turned author and campaigner, has died at the age of 70.

8897,"Many MPs are spending a lot of time in their constituencies preparing to contest the most closely-fought and unpredictable election in decades.
As early as last year Labour taunted the government that this was a ""zombie"" Parliament, as much of the legislation in the coalition's programme from 2010 had already been passed.
The opposition has repeated the allegation many times since. MPs on the government side have hit back with claims that Labour has given up scrutinising bills properly.
But as MPs look to the final few weeks before the dissolution of the Parliament elected in 2010, there are still a few bills left to deal with.
A bill to improve and strengthen the service complaints system and enable payments to be made to charities and other organisations that support the Armed Forces across the UK.
The bill began in the the Lords and has passed all stages in the upper house. It is awaiting its Commons report stage at a date to be confirmed.
It is likely that the third reading will also be taken on the same day. As the bill is not particularly controversial it is likely to see royal assent before Parliament is dissolved.
A bill overhauling consumer rights law, covering contracts for goods, services, digital content and the law relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts.
Consideration of Commons amendments in the Lords was on 24 February, so this will make it to the statute book.
A bill to devolve powers to set the rate of corporation tax to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
It was due to have its remaining Commons stages - report stage and third reading - on 4 March.
The devolution of powers to set the corporation tax rate was a key demand of political leaders ahead of the Stormont House Agreement finalised in Belfast last month.
It is still to go through the Lords but the government aims to pass the law before May's general election and Labour has not opposed it.
The bill makes a number of changes which would affect business generally and in particular areas including decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee.
All Commons stages are complete, while its third reading in the Lords is due on 4 March.
However, peers defeated the government during report stage, voting for there to be no move to decriminalise non-payment of the fee before 2017.
It remains to be seen if MPs will overturn this amendment and another game of ping pong will ensue.
First reading - the bill's formal introduction, in which the name of the bill is read out but no debate takes place.
Second reading - a debate on the general principles of a bill.
Committee stage - detailed scrutiny of the bill, either in a committee of the whole House or in a public bill committee.
Report stage - consideration of the report of the bill committee and a further chance for MPs or peers to table amendments.
Third reading - final consideration of the amended bill as a whole. In the House of Lords, there is a final chance to table amendments.
Ping pong - if one House rejects the other's amendments, the bill goes back and forth between the lower and upper Houses until agreement is reached.
A bill concerning the membership and functions of the House of Commons Commission, which is responsible for the administration and services of the House of Commons.
This bill was fast-tracked through the Commons, with all stages on one day - 24 February.
After that, it will need the approval of peers.
This is a private members' bill, which would put into legislation a target of spending at least 0.7% of national income on aid.
It has passed its Commons stages and had its report stage in the Lords on 27 February.
Unlike most private members' bills, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore's bill stands a good chance of becoming law.
The bill to allow women Church of England bishops to sit in the House of Lords had its committee stage in the upper House on 26 February.
It sailed through its Commons stages and its second reading in the Lords. Basically, its passage is guaranteed.
The first woman bishop has already been consecrated. The Right Reverend Libby Lane became Bishop of Stockport in January.
The bill to give people greater flexibility in accessing their pension benefits and to help them make informed decisions about what to do with benefits is at the ping pong stage.
MPs considered Lords amendments on 24 February.
The bill provides for a recall petition to be triggered if an MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House for at least 21 sitting days.
It is due to have its third reading in the Lords on 2 March, having passed all stages in the Commons.
This bill started in the Lords and had its Commons report stage and third reading on 23 February, with the Lords due to consider any amendments made by MPs in March.
This bill aims to improve access to finance for businesses and individuals and also concerns public procurement and the regulatory provisions relating to business and certain voluntary and community bodies.
It has passed all stages in the Commons and has its Lords report stage on 3 March.
This private bill, which applies to Transport for London and its subsidiaries, started in the House of Lords and had its Commons report stage on 26 February.
Private bills are usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, rather than the government.
They are distinct from private members' bills which are promoted by individual MPs or peers.
And spare a thought for those that are likely to fall by the wayside.
A bill which would confer powers to acquire land and to construct and operate phase one of HS2 - a high speed rail line from London to Birmingham.
This is a hybrid bill, which features aspects of a public bill and a private bill. This means it is of general application but it contains provisions which have a different legal effect on the private interests of particular persons.
The hybrid bill procedure gives those persons who are directly and specially affected an opportunity to petition against the bill and be heard in select committee.
Following the bill's second reading it was sent to a select committee and has remained there ever since.
The government has admitted that the legislation will not be passed before the general election.
This is private members' bill sponsored by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi.
It has passed all stages in the Lords and had its Commons second reading scheduled for 27 February, although it was too low down the day's schedule for MPs to even begin debating it.
Even if the bill manages a second reading, it might struggle to progress further in the time left before Parliament dissolves.
It has also faced some passionate opposition from other MPs and peers.

4855,"The Acting Up report suggests the high audition costs for drama school is one of several factors deterring people from working class backgrounds from entering the arts.
It also recommends more school trips to the theatre to encourage young pupils.
The government said it was a ""priority"" to ensure everyone can take part in the arts and culture, including in schools.
Former Coronation Street and EastEnders actress Tracy Brabin, who was first elected as an MP in by election last year, led the inquiry along with fellow Labour MP Gloria De Piero, who worked as a presenter on GMTV before becoming a politician.
Ms Brabin, whose best-known role was as single mother Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street from 1994 to 1997, said there was a ""diversity crisis on our stages and screens"".
The report, commissioned by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, looked at what more could be done at school level to encourage young people to consider a career in the arts.
It said that drama, and other related subjects, are often treated as inferior at some schools - and that students are sometimes discouraged from studying them.
It also suggested there are poor drama facilities, few arts excursions and a lack of awareness about arts career opportunities in many schools.
Ms Brabin, who also worked as a TV writer in her pre-political life, said: ""Our performing arts are some of the best in the world and they should represent our whole nation, not just a privileged section of it.
""But the systematic eradication of arts education in schools, sky-high drama school audition fees, chronic low pay and a lack of diversity behind the scenes are all contributing to a diversity crisis on our stages and screens.""
The publication of the report follows comments made by presenter Anita Rani last week, who said the pay gap among the BBC's top talent was as much about race and class as gender.
A government spokesman said it was investing Â£300m between 2016 and 2020 to encourage young people to participate in music and arts.
He said: ""We are completely committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to take part in arts and culture, including in schools.""

The Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.
They may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.
""Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,"" Thompson added. ""Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.
""The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.""
Meanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.
The Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.

""For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team,"" Thompson said. ""It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.
""I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.
""Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.
""If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.""
Thompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.
The 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.
""It's far too early to be making judgements,"" Thompson asserted. ""None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.
""One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.
""Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism.""","Derek McInnes deserves more praise for his achievements at Aberdeen, says ex-Scotland striker Steven Thompson.",39540625,xsum,"Former Rangers player and pundit Steven Thompson has praised Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes for his achievements in recent seasons, stating that he has done ""everything he can"" with the club but emphasising that ""success can be measured in other ways"".

10489,"These secondary populations could also be utilised in a way to reduce or halt the pressure on species' native populations, say researchers.
Adopting a more creative approach to conservation could help slow global biodiversity loss, they added.
The findings appear in the Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment journal.
""This first came to my attention when I read a news story about the seizure of an illegal shipment of 23 yellow crested cockatoos,"" said co-author Luke Gibson from the University of Hong Kong.
""Each individual had been stuffed inside a plastic water bottle.""
He learned that the species was critically endangered, which surprised him. ""I had been seeing the same species flying around directly outside my office at the university,"" he added.
This prompted Dr Gibson and his colleague Din Li Yong to investigate how a critically endangered species had become established as a self-sustaining outside of its natural range.
They discovered 49 cases of a globally threatened species becoming established as a separate population, including the the yellow crested cockatoo on Hong Kong island.
""This is a species which is primarily threatened by wildlife trade,"" he told BBC News.
""Poachers go out into the forest in its native range in eastern Indonesia and capture the bird and then ship them off, usually up to Hong Kong or China where there is a strong demand for pet birds.
""This is what has fuelled the decline of this species [in its native range]. But it's really interesting because that same cause also had another effect: some of the people who were keeping this species in Hong Kong accidentally or intentionally released them.""
As a result of enough of the birds being released, it allowed a new self-sustaining population to be be established on the island.
The government in Hong Kong has made it illegal to capture the species, even though it is a non-native species.
Because the city-state is affluent and relatively well educated, the cases of people breaking the law are extremely rare, explained Dr Gibson. Unlike in its native range in Indonesia where capturing birds forms a major source of income.
However, there can be downsides to the newly established population of endangered species, such as a limited genetic pool, contracting novel diseases, or hybridisation with closely related species, Dr Gibson added.
However, it did also present a possible ""very interesting"" opportunity for conservationists, he suggested.
This would involve ""harvesting"" some of the newly established secondary population. This would allow demands in the wildlife trade to be met but also relieve the pressures on the native populations.

8798,"Carlos Ghosn said there was a need to build a ""much higher awareness"" of the company's products in Brazil.
When Nissan took the decision to back the Games, the Brazilian market was booming with sales of 3.8 million vehicles a year.
But a recession has seen that sales figure tumble to 2 million a year.
""Without any doubt it's the right decision, the idea was to give more awareness to the Nissan brand,"" he told the BBC.
The company's goal with the Olympics sponsorship is to help increase its market-share in Brazil from 3% to 5%, he said.
The 31st Olympic Games officially start in Rio on Friday with the opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium.
As part of its sponsorship, Nissan is supplying 5,000 cars for the Games and the Brazilian Olympic team to use.
The company has used Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt in its adverts since 2012.
Mr Ghosn says the global car market will continue to be sluggish until 2019, with growth of just 1% next year.
He expects the US car market to be strong, and sees Europe continuing to recover ""even though it will be impacted by Brexit"".
The UK economy will see some contraction due to Brexit, ""not because there is anything wrong with the UK, but because markets hate uncertainty,"" Mr Ghosn said.
The company will be keeping a close eye on future negotiations over the UK's exit from the European Union.
Nissan employs 6,700 staff at its plant in Sunderland in northern England.
""We are reasonably optimistic at the end of the day common sense will prevail from both sides,"" Mr Ghosn said.

""That will determine how, and how much we will invest in the UK,"" he said.
Mr Ghosn said there was ""no doubt"" that prices for Renaults, and other cars made in Europe and sold in the UK, will rise due to the falling value of the British pound.

4202,"He said payments to them for their image rights were ""the most significant risk in football"" faced by HMRC.
Some footballers and entertainers have income from image rights paid into offshore accounts without tax deducted.
HMRC said dozens of footballers are under investigation for potential irregularities in their tax affairs.
Mr Thompson told MPs that on the issue of image rights: ""I think if it was me, I would want to review this... It is quite difficult to explain to a football fan that that is the law.""
The HMRC's head of enforcement, Jennie Grainger, said that 43 players, eight agents and 12 football clubs were under investigation.
Ms Granger said HMRC has a dedicated team looking at image rights, football, other sports, and the entertainment industry.
She told the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC): ""Just on football itself, in the last two years, that team, and wider across HMRC, has brought in £158m in yield.""
Ms Granger said HMRC is investigating whether some claims to separate image rights earnings from earnings as players are genuine.
""Has it been properly transferred? Has it been transferred for a fair value? Should there be income coming back to the UK depending on their residency status? All of those issues can be part of this,"" she said.
The officials also told the PAC that HMRC had seven criminal investigations under way and had made arrests following publication of the Panama Papers, which provided a huge amount of information about the tax affairs of wealthy individuals.
The action follows the formation of an inter-agency task force six months ago, including HMRC, the FCA, the Serious Fraud Office and National Crime Agency.
At the weekend, the PAC's chairwoman, Meg Hillier, said the tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials, following allegations that he used offshore companies to reduce his tax bill.
Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax.
According to reports in the Sunday Times, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed £10m (€12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm, which it suggests has no employees.
The newspaper also claims that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights.
However, Mr Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies both claims.
He says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules.
The statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber-attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published.
HMRC said it would not comment on named individuals, but took ""all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously"" and ""always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided"".
The head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - on Friday.
Manchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho's arrival at the club and so it would not comment.","The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, has told MPs he would like to see a review of the way footballers can reduce their tax bills.",38235022,xsum,"The HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials have warned MPs that footballers receiving payments for image rights are the “most significant risk in football”.

6053,"Using measurements from an infrared telescope in Hawaii, a UK and US team found evidence for temperatures as high as 1,500C - hundreds of degrees warmer than anywhere else on the planet.
They suggest the hotspot is created by thunderous soundwaves ""breaking"" in the thin upper reaches of the atmosphere.
The research is published in Nature.
It arguably solves what planetary scientists had dubbed an ""energy crisis"" for gas giants like Jupiter: temperatures in their upper atmospheres soar much higher than can be explained by solar energy - especially given their vast distances from the Sun.
If the mysterious heat were generated by local sources, like Jupiter's famous storm, then the conundrum would be solved - and these measurements are the first direct evidence of any such activity.
Study co-author Dr Tom Stallard, from the University of Leicester, said this was a major step forward in a ""20-30 year odyssey"" to try and understand heat flow on Jupiter.
""Ever since Voyager, we've had measurements of the temperature at the top of Jupiter's atmosphere, and it's been hot across the whole globe - from the poles, all the way to the equator,"" he told the BBC.
Jupiter's enormous, dramatic aurora can explain the heat in the polar regions, but for that warmth to reach the equator would require incredibly dramatic mixing, which modelling studies haven't been able to support.
""There's no real excuse for it to be so hot,"" said Dr James O'Donoghue from Boston University, the paper's first author.
The freshly discovered spike in temperature, detected using a spectrometer at the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, offers a solution.
Several hundred km directly above the clouds of the Great Red Spot, the hotspot suggests that high-altitude heat is somehow created by the turmoil beneath.
""Several people have argued that it's likely that the heat comes from below, but the observations have never backed them up,"" Dr Stallard said.
He and his colleagues don't know exactly what is causing the heat, but they have some ideas. It could be driven by great Jovian thunderclaps, rumbling upwards from the churning red clouds of the Solar System's biggest storm.
""You get some kind of acoustic event, probably thunder or something like that - or possibly other forms of sound energy - and that propagates directly upwards,"" Dr Stallard explained.
""That wave will continue going upwards until it reaches a lower-density region at the top of the atmosphere, and then it breaks and deposits all that wave energy into the top of the atmosphere, just like waves break on the shore - as the water gets thinner, it's less able to carry that wave and so it breaks and you see lots of energy.""
There is a precedent for such sound-driven warming much closer to home, according to Dr O'Donoghue.
""There is some evidence in Earth's atmosphere, above storms and above features such as mountains - the Andes mountains in fact - that there are acoustic waves emanating from them, and that they propagate up into the atmosphere and cause heating there,"" he said.
The key to revealing the temperature spike was a tiny ion: H3+, a hydrogen molecule (H2) with an added proton. It is incredibly reactive and consequently, short-lived and rare on Earth. But in the sparse fringe of Jupiter's outer atmosphere there is almost nothing else for it to react with.
Crucially, this ion works like a glowing, long-range thermometer for scientists, if they have the right sort of telescope - such as the spectrometer at the IRTF, which gathered the relevant data in a single nine-hour window back in 2012.
""Just by measuring its light, you can find out the temperature wherever it is,"" said Dr O'Donoghue. ""And it's throughout all of the gas giant upper atmospheres - so it's essentially an in situ temperature probe.""
Further insights might come from Nasa's Juno spacecraft, now in orbit around Jupiter after its five-year trek.
Dr Stallard said that telescopes around the world were trained on the gas giant to take parallel measurements - and his team had planned their observations with the mission in mind.
""We thought, this is something that we haven't addressed, and it needed addressing. We've really ramped up our studies away from the aurora.
""Juno's going to reveal magnificent levels of detail about... what the aurora are and how they're generated. But it will be interesting to see how much it tells us about the non-auroral regions and the top of the atmosphere.
""Obviously it's been designed to look deep, and to look at the aurora at the poles, but potentially Juno could reveal a lot more.""

9663,"Officials believe Lawrence Phillips, 40, killed himself early on Wednesday.
In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL.
Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field.
After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law.
Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers.
In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend.
Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate.
On Tuesday, a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Damion Soward, 37.
It is unclear how he took his own life.

10297,"Slow-motion footage revealed the spiders used their silk draglines to stabilise their bodies and to brake, enabling them to land poised and ready to pounce on prey.
The discovery, the scientists say, could inspire new robot design.
It is published in the Royal Society journal Interface.
Kai-jung Chi, from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan, and her colleagues investigated the jumping ability of Adanson's house spider, a common arachnid that jumps when it hunts, in order to surprise its prey.
Ultimately, Dr Chi and her team hope to learn exactly how these creatures fine-tune and control their jumping manoeuvres, to aid the design of miniature robots able to move in similar ways.
Dr Chi's colleague, PhD student Yung-Kang Chen, filmed the spiders at 1,000 frames per second, and slowed down the resulting footage. They compared the movements of the Adanson's spider with those of a species of jumping spider that does not use a silk dragline.
""We analysed the motion and body orientation throughout the jumps,"" Dr Chi told BBC News.
This revealed that the Adanson's spider used its dragline to control the orientation of its body mid-air and to brake as it landed.
The non-silk jumping spider would often lose balance - tipping forward and onto its back upon landing.
""[The silk means that the spiders] can land in the optimal position to rapidly initiate prey capture,"" Dr Chi said.
The results, she said, suggested that the spiders were taking up the slack in their silk dragline by using the valve in their spinning system.
These super-fast adjustments mean that silk provides more than just a safety line for a jumping spider.

The Moto Z uses magnets to add optional hardware modules to the phone's rear including a speaker and a projector.
Analysts said the innovations might prove a tough sell.
That would complicate Lenovo's efforts to turn around sales of its own phones and those of the Motorola division it bought from Google for $2.8bn in 2014.
""There's a delicate balance between being on the leading edge and the bleeding edge, and Lenovo skirts that line,"" said Ramon Llamas from the tech research firm IDC.
""If these products prove to be a hit - and that's a big if - then Lenovo emerges as a leading edge vendor.
""The Phab2Pro has a lot of promise, showing immediate value creation within certain use cases. The Moto Z is certainly innovative, but I'm not sure how much consumers can wrap their brains around modular devices.""
The announcements were made at an event in San Francisco, where bendy smartphone and tablet prototypes were also revealed.
Lenovo is currently the world's sixth bestselling smartphone-maker, according to IDC, after being overtaken by two other Chinese brands, Oppo and Vivo towards the start of the year.
The Beijing-based company reported in May that it had swung to a loss of $128m (Â£89m) in its last financial year.
It acknowledged at the time that it was having problems integrating Motorola.
The Phab2Pro is the first device to use Google's Tango technology.
The search firm has developed a system that adds depth-sensing and motion-tracking cameras to the normal front and rear photo lenses.
Lenovo suggested this opened up several possibilities, including:
However, an on-stage demo proved problematic.
A game of virtual dominos - seen superimposed over a view of a real desk - saw the pieces repeatedly freeze part way through their intended run.
And an effort to use the sensors to get the dimensions of a real-world table took several attempts to get the software to lock onto the object.
This raises questions about whether the tech is ready to go on sale as planned in September.
""In real life you're just going to use a tape measure"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.
""It's just a classic example of a solution looking for a problem.
""Yes, you can envisage some lovely use cases - for example a DHL app that would let you hold up a parcel and give you its dimensions and the approximate cost to send it.
""But that doesn't exist yet, and what you end up with is an underwhelming measuring demo.""
The Moto Z introduces the concept of Moto Mods - snap-on parts that connect to the back of the phone via 16 small metal pins.
Examples of modules it plans to offer alongside the phone include:
Lenovo said it was working with others to create new modules and also urged developers to create more following the phone's release later this summer.
LG already has an alternative modular handset on sale - the G5 - and Google is working on Project Ara, a design that will allow several parts to be added at once.
They mark a break with a trend that has seen phone manufacturers integrate components as closely together as possible to maximise battery life and computing power.
One industry watcher questioned the appeal.
""Consumers just do not want another item to carry with them,"" said Carolina Milanesi from the market research firm Creative Strategies.
""When we do chose to carry something separate, it serves a very specific purpose or it is made by a brand that we want to carry because it is the best in that segment.
""While Lenovo talked about wanting to limit compromise it seems to me that you are still left with one.""
Lenovo also showed off several concept devices at its presentation.
These included a smartphone and tablet with flexible screens.
This allowed the handset to be wrapped around a person's wrist so that it did not have to be held, and a tablet to be folded in half, making it easier to use one-handed.
In addition, the firm briefly showed off a revised model of its smart shoes.
It said the Intel processor-equipped footwear could track its wearer's movements and calorie burn.
The firm did not, however, say when any of these might go on sale.
Motorola's Razr - the thin flip phone from 2003 - was an iconic piece of design, something the company has been trying to replicate ever since.
Today, Motorola - now part of Lenovo after a brief stint being owned by Google - thinks Moto Mods might be its next design masterstroke. I don't.
The firm has been working on a modular phone for some time, and the idea of swapping components is appealing - strapping on a projector when you need it, or souped-up speakers, could be very useful.
But there are already battery packs out there. And Bluetooth accessories that will give you much the same functionality. They may not be as easy to ""snap"", but I can't see it being enough to tempt people into ditching what they already have.
In the same vein, the Phab2Pro, the smartphone with Tango built in, offers some promising new applications worth thinking about, particularly for retail.
But the question isn't whether Tango is cool. It clearly is. The question is whether Tango is the sort of feature that would alter your smartphone buying choices.
And that's where the technology falls well short. It's a luxury, not a necessity, and when up against its cheaper rivals, a Lenovo phone with Tango won't ever be more appealing to the masses than a cheaper smartphone from Xiaomi or ZTE.

Bydd pleidlais yn cael ei chynnal yn y Senedd ddydd Mercher ar argymhelliad y Prif Weinidog, ac mae'r blaid Lafur wedi dweud y bydd yn pleidleisio gyda'r llywodraeth.
Rhaid i Theresa May dderbyn cefnogaeth y senedd i gynnal etholiad cyn dyddiad swyddogol yr etholiad nesaf oedd wedi ei chlustnodi - yn 2020.
Byddai etholiad cyffredinol ym mis Mehefin yn sicrhau arweinyddiaeth gref a chadarn wrth i'r llywodraeth gynnal trafodaethau gyda'r Undeb Ewropeaidd yn y misoedd i ddod, meddai Mrs May.
""Ar foment genedlaethol arwyddocaol fe ddylai fod undod yn San Steffan ond yn lle hynny mae rhwygiadau. Mae'r wlad yn dod at ei gilydd ond dyw San Steffan ddim.""
Dywedodd Mrs May bod y pleidiau eraill yn gwneud eu gorau i lesteirio amserlen y DU i adael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd.
Ychwanegodd: ""Mae ein gwrthwynebwyr yn credu bod mwyafrif y llywodraeth mor fach y byddwn yn simsanu, y gallen nhw ein gorfodi i newid llwybr. Ond maen nhw'n anghywir.
""Os nad ydyn ni'n cynnal pleidlais gyffredinol rŵan bydd eu gemau gwleidyddol yn parhau.""
Dywedodd hefyd bod y rhwygiadau yn peryglu ymdrechion y llywodraeth i gael bargen dda i Brydain wrth adael ac yn achosi ""ansefydlogrwydd"" i'r wlad.
Ychwanegodd ei bod wedi bod yn gyndyn o gymryd y cam o alw am etholiad, ond y byddai'r etholiad er budd y wlad.
Dywedodd arweinydd y blaid Lafur yn San Steffan, Jeremy Corbyn: ""Rydw i'n croesawu penderfyniad y Prif Weinidog i roi cyfle i bobl Prydain i bleidleisio dros lywodraeth fydd yn rhoi buddiannau'r mwyafrif yn gyntaf.""

Ond yn dilyn ei chyhoeddiad, trydarodd Prif Weinidog Cymru Carwyn Jones: ""Wel, nes i ddim gweld hynny'n dod. Mae galw etholiad yng nghanol etholiad arall yn od. Proses heddwch Gogledd Iwerddon yn cael ei hanwybyddu?""
Ychwanegodd mewn ail neges: ""Mae'n rhaid i mi ddweud nad yw'r etholiad yma ""er budd y wlad"". Dylai'r ffocws fod ar Brexit a'r economi, nid polau piniwn.""
Dywedodd arweinydd Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood: ""Mae llywodraeth y DU wedi ymrwymo ein gwlad i lwybr economaidd afreolus eithafol.
""Mae Cymru angen ASau fydd yn herio'r Torïaid a bod yn llais rhesymol yn y Senedd, gan amddiffyn cysylltiadau economaidd hanfodol ein gwlad gydag Ewrop a gweddill y byd.""
Cafodd y cyhoeddiad ei groesawu hefyd gan arweinydd UKIP yn y Cynulliad Neil Hamilton: ""Mae hyn yn gyfle gwych i'r etholwyr bleidleisio i gael gwared â'r ASau oedd eisiau aros yn rhan o'r UE yng Nghymru, ac ethol AS UKIP fydd yn cynrychioli eu buddiannau yn y senedd.""
Ychwanegodd Mark Williams, arweinydd y Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol yng Nghymru y byddai'r etholiad yn ""gyfle i newid cyfeiriad y wlad"".
""Os ydych chi eisiau osgoi Brexit caled, os ydych chi eisiau cadw Prydain yn rhan o'r farchnad sengl, os ydych chi eisiau Prydain sydd yn agored, goddefgar ac unedig, dyma'ch cyfle,"" meddai.
Dywedodd arweinydd y Blaid Werdd yng Nghymru, Grenville Ham fod yr etholiad yn ""gyfle gwych i roi stop ar lymder"" gan fod ""pleidiau wedi dilyn ideoleg sydd wedi gorfodi caledi diangen ar y bobl fwyaf tlawd ac anghenus ym Mhrydain"".
O dan reolau'r Ddeddf Cyfnod Seneddol Sefydlog, does gan y Prif Weinidog ddim hawl i gyhoeddi etholiad cyffredinol ar fyr rybudd heb gefnogaeth aelodau Tŷ'r Cyffredin.
Yn ôl y polau piniwn diweddaraf, mae gan y Ceidwadwyr fantais sylweddol dros y blaid Lafur - gyda'r Torïaid 21 o bwyntiau ar y blaen yn ôl YouGov.
Bydd yr etholiad sydyn hefyd yn golygu y bydd pobl Cymru'n pleidleisio dros 40 o Aelodau Seneddol, yn hytrach na 29 o aelodau, fel oedd wedi ei fwriadu petai'r newidiadau i ffiniau seneddol wedi dod i rym cyn etholiad 2020.

307,"He has sent a business case to Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir outlying how he intends to tackle the projected £490m overspend.
The scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Mrs Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister.
Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources.
However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed.
The plan by the economy minister has now been formally submitted to the Department of Finance for approval.
Mr Hamilton and Mr Ó Muilleoir held talks on the issue last week.
Analysis: BBC News NI's Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill
The BBC understands the plan involves a two-staged approach.
First, it would reduce the tariffs paid to around 1,800 people who got into the scheme before November 2015.
This would require an Assembly vote to change the tariffs from the new financial year starting in April.
Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a longer-term solution.
But there remains an acceptance within the Department for the Economy that any moves on tariffs could face a legal challenge.
It is understood that a significant number of RHI recipients have told the Department for the Economy they do not wish their names made public.
The department had written to them asking for views on their names being released.
Mrs Foster and Mr Hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited.
It is believed the department is taking legal advice on its options.
The failure of the political parties to find a resolution on how to investigate the failings in the scheme has led to a political crisis at Stormont.
Martin McGuinness resigned on Monday as deputy first minister in protest against the botched handling of the scheme and, after Mrs Foster refused to step aside while an investigation was held.
Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing agreement, Mrs Foster loses her first minister role with the departure of Mr McGuinness.
The Sinn Féin MLA's decision to quit is likely to lead to a snap election.

The Renewable Heating Incentive (RHI), established in 2012, provided subsidies for businesses to switch to renewable energy. However, the scheme became oversubscribed and businesses received more in subsidies that they paid for fuel. Hamilton's proposal involves a two-stage approach, firstly reducing tariffs from 1,800 recipients who joined the scheme before November 2015, and secondly, undertaking a consultation to find a long-term solution. The inability of Northern Irish politicians to agree on how to investigate the scheme has triggered a political crisis.

Hamilton's plan involves firstly reducing the tariffs paid to 1,800 people who got into the scheme prior to November 2015, subject to an Assembly vote. Secondly, there would be a public consultation on a long-term solution.

7789,"The aim of the scheme was to increase bank lending by up to £70bn.
The government changed the rules in January 2014, with this type of funding is no longer used to support mortgage lending.
The scheme aimed to bolster the economy, by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing that the UK had experienced since the onset of the credit crunch and international banking crisis.
Banks and building societies are able to access the funds until the end of January 2015.
How does it work?
In essence, the Bank of England is letting commercial banks borrow funds from it cheaply, so that the banks then pass this on in the form of cheap loans to firms.
What is the point?
The point is to encourage the UK's commercial banks to borrow more money, and more cheaply than at present, so they can then in turn lend it to companies who wish to borrow.
Is it working?
The debate is fierce. Some report banks are still unwilling to lend to business. Others say businesses are unwilling to take on new debt and are paying back loans. Either way, repayments are rising faster than borrowing, leaving the latest ""net"" lending figure (for the first quarter of 2014) down.
So what are the mechanics of FLS?
Banks and other lenders approach the Bank of England, if they want. They swap assets they already have, such as loans, with the Bank. It in turn provides them with pieces of paper known as Treasury bills, for a four-year period.
The commercial banks are then able to use these bits of paper as top quality backing with which to borrow cash in the wholesale financial markets, from other lenders. With the Treasury's backing, the idea is that they will be able to borrow funds at very cheap rates.
How will the taxpayer be protected in this arrangement?
The collateral pledged by commercial banks will have to be worth more than the high-grade paper being offered by the Bank of England.  So, for every £1 of Treasury bills they borrow, the assets being pledged will have to be worth, say, £1.10 or £1.20. Thus if the value of that asset subsequently falls, the Bank of England will not suffer from the top slice of any loss.
What about savers?
They have suffered an unforeseen knock-on effect of FLS. The availability of cheap funds from the Bank means that lenders do not need to try so hard to attract funds from the general public, to then lend on to borrowers. That is why it is now almost impossible to find a savings account offering more than 3% interest.","Funding for Lending (FLS), the Bank of England and Treasury scheme, initially to boost bank lending to households and companies, opened for business at the beginning of August 2012.",18460302,xsum,"The Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) allows commercial banks to borrow funds cheaply from the central bank, which they can then lend to businesses. The goal of the program is to encourage banks to lend cheaply to companies who wish to borrow. However, opinions on its effectiveness are mixed, with some arguing that banks are still unwilling to lend or companies unwilling to take on new debt, leading to a drop in net lending. Under the program, commercial banks pledge collateral worth more than the high-grade paper being offered by the central bank as a guarantee. This taxpayer protection means that banks can borrow funds at very cheap rates. One drawback of the FLS is that it has led savings accounts to offer less than 3% interest as lenders get sufficient funds from cheaper sources. 
","The Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), launched in 2012, allowed commercial banks to borrow from the Bank of England cheaply so that they could lend that money to firms at reduced rates. The government aimed to increase bank lending by up to £70bn via this scheme to grow the economy. The FLS stopped supporting mortgage lending and was available to banks and building societies until the end of January 2015. While some believe it boosted lending, others don't. For instance, repayments are rising faster than borrowing, reducing the latest ""net"" lending figure. To borrow from the Bank of England, the commercial banks swapped existing assets, such as loans. They used Treasury bills obtained through the Bank of England as collateral to obtain funds in the wholesale financial markets. Collateral pledged was worth more than the high-grade paper offered by Bank of England, safeguarding taxpayers' interests. Since lenders did not need to try so hard to attract funds from the general public, as a result of the FLS, savers saw limited scope for attractive savings accounts."

The proposed cycle route will link Leith Walk in the east of the city to Roseburn in the west, via the city centre and Haymarket.
The plans include reducing four lanes of traffic from Roseburn to Haymarket to two, and using half a carriageway and a bus lane for cyclists.
Supporters of the path said it was vital for cutting congestion and would provide a safe route across the city. They said it would also encourage more active travel.

When Liverpool host Wolves in the FA Cup fourth round, it will be over two years since boyhood Reds fan Coady, now 23, was allowed to leave the club.
And he is intent only on helping his side become the third in a week to win at Anfield.
""We're going there to win and hopefully take the game to them,"" he told BBC WM.
Coady never got to play a home game in his three years at Anfield, with both his first-team appearances coming on the road, the second as a late sub for Philippe Coutinho in a 3-1 win at Fulham, his only one in the Premier League.
After a season-long loan with Sheffield United, he eventually moved on to Huddersfield Town in August 2014 and then Wolves a year later.
But Coady knows, from his experience watching the Reds as a boy, that Liverpool do not have many slumps of the current magnitude and Wolves might have timed their trip to Anfield just right.
""We've got a great chance the way Liverpool are playing,"" he said. ""They're a top team but they've had quite a lot of games.""
Since Wolves won 2-0 in the third round at Stoke on 7 January, Paul Lambert's men have only played twice, while Liverpool have been in action six times.
Of those six games, they have won only once - the FA Cup third-round replay at League Two side Plymouth - have failed to score in three of them and have lost their last two at home.
Following the shock home defeat by Swansea City which damaged their Premier League title hopes, Wednesday's League Cup semi-final exit to Southampton has cast a cloud over Anfield.
""We've got to take that into account,"" said Coady. ""We've got go there on the front foot, try to stop them playing, hopefully nick the ball and see if we can get something out of it.""
And what if Coady himself were to find the net? ""It would be what dreams are made of,"" he grinned. ""I'm not one of those who wouldn't celebrate. I'd go ballistic to score for this club. It doesn't happen very often.""
Wolves boss Lambert knows what it takes to win at Anfield. His Aston Villa side did so in December 2012, and Wolves loan signing Andreas Weimann was one of the Villa scorers that day in a 3-1 victory.
So can he do it again? Fourth in the Premier League v 18th in the Championship?
""We're up against an iconic club, and we're going to have to handle the atmosphere and the crowd, but I'd be disappointed if we couldn't handle the occasion,"" Lambert told BBC WM.
""If we can do that, we can win the game. And I believe in them. Mentally, they're ready for it. They'll handle it.""
Lambert is keenly awaiting his reunion with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who he first met when they did the Pro Licence coaching course together in Germany in 2004.
He was playing for Celtic by then, long after he had helped Borussia Dortmund win the European Cup in 1997 and four years before Klopp took over as Dortmund boss in 2008.
""He was also at a club I was fortunate to play for,"" said Lambert. ""There were connections between us and he went on to bring Dortmund back to where they should have been - two league titles, two cups and a kick away from winning the Champions League.
""He is a big character and a really top guy. Some interviews at the minute make me laugh.""",Wolves midfielder Conor Coady will be fulfilling a boyhood dream when he finally gets to play a first-team game at Anfield on Saturday.,38772176,xsum,"Wolves captain Conor Coady, a former Liverpool player, has said he is ""going to win"" when his team goes to Anfield for their FA Cup fourth-round clash.

His side, which is 18th in the Championship, are competing against a side who have been in poor form recently, losing their past two games at Anfield. Klopp's side has played six games since Wolves won their last fixture against Stoke on 7 January.
","Wolves captain Conor Coady, a former Liverpool player, is confident that his team can defeat the club during the FA Cup fourth round match.

3856,"The decision was announced at a meeting in the German city of Bonn after the UN's cultural committee spent more than a year considering its nomination.
World heritage status is given to sites of ""outstanding universal value"" with the aim of protecting them for future generations.
The distinctive red bridge has carried trains over the Forth since 1890.
Scotland's other World Heritage Sites are New Lanark, St Kilda, the Old and New Towns in Edinburgh, Neolithic Orkney and the Antonine Wall.
The award puts it alongside the Pyramids of Egypt, the great Wall of China and the Sydney Opera House in terms of cultural significance.
The bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth between South Queensferry on the outskirts of Edinburgh and North Queensferry in Fife, was opened in 1890 after eight years of construction.
Designed by Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker, it measures 2,529m (1.5 miles), weighs 53,000 tonnes and was at the time the world's longest multi-span cantilever bridge.
When it was constructed it was one of the most ambitious projects of its kind ever attempted, and at its peak, more than 4,500 men were employed building it.
The Unesco inspection report stated: ""This enormous structure, with its distinctive industrial aesthetic and striking red colour, was conceived and built using advanced civil engineering design principles and construction methods.
""Innovative in design, materials and scale, the Forth Bridge is an extraordinary and impressive milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel.""
For 125 years it has been an icon of Victorian engineering excellence, a symbol of Scotland and even a favourite expression for a never-ending task.
Now the Forth Bridge is listed alongside the Pyramids of Egypt, the great Wall of China and the Sydney Opera House in terms of cultural significance.
We've brought together some facts and figures - and more great pictures - of one of Britain's best-known structures, which you can see here.
The bid for World Heritage status was led by the Forth Bridges Forum, which was established by the Scottish government to promote the three Forth Bridges.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the bridge was one of the ""industrial wonders of the world"" and congratulated the team behind the bid.
She added: ""The Forth Bridge is an outstanding example of Scotland's built heritage.
""Its endurance is testament not only to the ingenuity of those who designed and built it but also to the generations of painters, engineers and maintenance crews who have looked after it through the years.""
The bridge is owned by Network Rail, whose infrastructure director, David Dickson, described it as ""a prime example of civil engineering and an iconic structure, not only in Scotland but across the world.""
Mike Cantlay, chairman ofTourism agency VisitScotland said World Heritage Site status would lends ""even greater aura and appeal to one of the planet's most instantly recognisable landmarks"".
He added: ""The timing is perfect as, in 2016, this country will celebrate the Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design and you would be hard-pushed to find a better example of all three qualities anywhere in the world than in the Forth Bridge.""
UK Heritage Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""Recognition as a World Heritage Site will draw more tourists to the area as well as making sure one of the UK's great engineering feats stands for future generations.""

7070,"From next season, the Championship winners will go up automatically if they meet 'minimum standard criteria'.
Jersey and Yorkshire Carnegie are among clubs that are in favour of the change.
""I hope it doesn't lead to the Championship becoming a non-entity,"" said Pirates chairman Paul Durkin.
""If you're relegated from the Premiership you're put in the naughty boys corner, which is in the Championship, for a year and expected to come back up.
""That's what it feels like to us, the way that it's going - it takes away from the competition, I think.""
As part of the new agreement between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby, Championship clubs will be given increased funding.
Durkin told BBC Radio Cornwall that second-tier sides will share £2.7m between them over three years, but relegated Premiership sides will receive a parachute payment of ""over £3m"".
""While first past the post is a good idea, and I would be in favour of that if there was a level playing field, this is not a level playing field,"" he continued.
The majority of Championship sides, including Jersey Reds, are not eligible for promotion, as they lack the required ground facilities.
""You've got London Irish sitting top of the Championship, 15 points ahead of Yorkshire Carnegie - they're undefeated,"" Reds chairman Mark Morgan told BBC Radio Jersey.
""It would be very unfair to get to the end of the season and, just because they have one bad game in a knock-out situation, they don't go to the Premiership.""
The 2015-16 Championship play-off final was held on 25 May, with the new Premiership campaign starting 100 days later.
""To be in the middle of May recruiting for a new season that is just two or three months away is impossible - and we can see the result that's had on Bristol,"" Morgan added.
""Although they would not say that they have ring fenced the Premiership, to all intents and purposes on a financial basis that's really what's happened.""
Yorkshire Carnegie were in the top flight as recently as 2011 - they are now second in the Championship, which will put them in the promotion play-offs this term but count for nothing from next season.
Although scrapping the play-offs could arguably make it more difficult for them to go up, executive president Sir Ian McGeechan, the former British & Irish Lions coach, supports the RFU change.
""Having been part the play-off system for a number of years, I am pleased to see the return of the first-past-the-post system,"" he said.
""The decision to make this announcement now is particularly welcome for all the clubs and allows the Championship sides the opportunity to get their financial and personnel planning in place for 2017-18 at the right time of year.""
The Championship play-offs were introduced for the 2009-10 campaign, with Exeter Chiefs the side to gain promotion despite finishing second in the regular season.
Bristol - the side Exeter defeated in the final - have been the side most affected by the play-offs, finishing top of the league on five occasions before finally reaching the Premiership last year.
""Most people would probably say [scrapping play-offs] benefits the Premiership - I wouldn't disagree with that,"" Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
""It'll be a tougher scenario and a different management situation for the regular Championship clubs, because they can't focus on seeing if they can create some moments in a final.
""They now have to create a good pre-season that builds a good start to the season, because they'll need to be up and challenging from day one.""","The Championship has become a ""naughty boys corner"" for relegated Premiership sides, according to the Cornish Pirates chairman, after the scrapping of play-offs from the second tier.",39195255,xsum,"From the start of the 2018-2019 season, rugby union's second-tier Championship will allow eligible teams to be automatically promoted to the Premier League based on their meeting of 'minimum standard criteria'.

Though many Championship teams support the move, it is also feared that significant financial disparities will grow, with those promoted from the Premier League receiving larger financial rewards than Championship sides.

4465,"He's been refused somewhere to stay because he comes from Ebola hotspot, Sierra Leone.
Amara arrived in Norwich from West Africa a fortnight ago and was turned down by two landlords - one by letter.
Both were happy for him to stay until he handed over his passport and they realised he was from a country at the centre of the current epidemic.
He told Newsbeat that he was ""devastated to be turned down"".
The letter said: ""Under normal circumstance. Your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers.
""However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the ebola outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future.""
Amara, 35, told Newsbeat that it is wrong to assume all people from Sierra Leone carry the disease.
He says: ""It's very unreasonable. And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that's just completely unfair.""
The good news for Amara is that after a few weeks of looking, he's found somewhere to stay so he can continue his studies.
More than 4,400 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mainly in West Africa.
Britain has now begun screening passengers at Heathrow airport.
People arriving from the worst-affected countries will be questioned and may have their temperatures taken.

How worried should we be here in the UK?
I think we should be worried about Ebola in West Africa because sadly the cases have gone up and up but the situation in the UK is very different from the situation in West Africa.
Was the landlord right to be so cautious?
I understand why people are concerned about Ebola but what people need to do is look at the facts and then make sensible decisions. You're not going to get Ebola from renting your flat to someone from Sierra Leone.
How do people get Ebola?
Ebola is passed on if someone is in contact with the bodily fluids of someone who is actually sick with the disease. So clearly letting out your property wont put people at risk.
Is the virus going to become airborne?
There is no evidence that the virus is airborne and we have never seen the virus change and become airborne - so there is no evidence to say that this will happen here.

2133,"Having a baby is a joyous occasion for most women - but for one in 10, pregnancy and the period following childbirth can be anything but rosy.
Depression, anxiety and stress can be the overriding feelings they experience and, if left untreated, the risk increases that they develop into serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychoses and eating disorders.
The mental health of this group of women during pregnancy and after birth - whether the illness already existed beforehand or developed for the first time - has been of particular concern to mental health professionals for some time.
Psychiatric disorders are the cause of 7% of all maternal deaths during pregnancy and the six months after the birth.
So why are there still women falling through the net?
Guidelines from NICE, the health watchdog, say women at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy, be provided with a care plan for their treatment and be offered advice on the safest and most appropriate drugs to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Research suggests providing this level of care will improve not only the long-term well-being of the mother but protect the child's emotional and physical development too.
But the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), which represents more than 70 organisations committed to improving the mental health of mothers and their infants, says this isn't happening in many areas of the country.
Dr Alain Gregoire, consultant and honorary senior lecturer in perinatal psychiatry, and chair of the MMHA, says this failure is costing lives.
Suicide is an increased risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders, he says.
And then there's the cost to society, he points out, of Â£8bn a year in lost earnings and NHS care.
He says: ""It's a very critical time in women's lives and it's important to get it right.""
The inquest heard that Ms Bevan stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication some time before the birth of her daughter because she wanted to breastfeed.
Dr Gregoire says decisions like this should be part of a care plan agreed in advance and need not be a major issue, he adds.
""There are many medication options available with no evidence of risk to the baby, whereas there is clear evidence that women being unwell is not good for mother or baby.""
Stopping medication suddenly is never advised and can be avoided because there are always other effective treatment options, he says.
Rachael Jones felt no connection with her pregnancy and no happiness at the thought of son's arrival five years ago.
She had always wanted children but she didn't tell anyone how she was feeling because she didn't understand the feelings herself.
""No-one asked me how I was feeling. There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw.""
It was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too.
During a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression.
And, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation.
She says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health.
Rachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy.
She also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times.
If or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK.
But a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved.
Another map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all.
However, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing Â£75m over the next five years ""to help drive improvements"".
""Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions.""
The Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women.
But this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place.
NHS England estimates that around 3% of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1% will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit.
That's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help.
They are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe.
Rachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal.
Instead, she suffered in silence.","The family of Charlotte Bevan, whose body was found in the Avon Gorge with her four-day old daughter, has called for a dedicated service which looks after women with serious mental health problems before, during and after childbirth.",34474213,xsum,"One in 10 women experience depression, anxiety, and stress during pregnancy or after childbirth, which can lead to serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or eating disorders.

Suicide is a significant risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders. The lack of care costs society £8bn ($10.3bn) annually in lost earnings and NHS care.

The inquest of Charlotte Bevan, who took her own life after stopping medication prior to breastfeeding her child, is used to highlight the lack of adequate care provisions in the UK, where there are not enough mother and baby units, or specialist community perinatal mental health teams.

6054,"From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories.
The long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round.
BBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games.
With a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world.
West Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup.
The team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup.
West Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1.
""There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,"" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson.
""We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.""
West Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain.
They were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United.
In preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2.
""Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,"" manager Mark Fell said. ""The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation.
""This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.""
When the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them.
Jack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago.
""Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,"" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. ""He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.""
Chris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.
With a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it.
Formed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards.
They shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books.
Claudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup.
He left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition.
""The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,"" says Vintila. ""We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.""
FC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend.
As a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history.
""I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,"" Phillips told BBC Sport. ""I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.""
Perhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser.
The Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service.
On Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round...
Never mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - £15 kit bags.
Sporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs.
""That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,"" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA.
""The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a £15 bag each.""
Ellesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth.
The Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football -  and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season.
Ellesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat.
""We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,"" says club secretary John Edge. ""It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.""
On 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings.
The trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill.
""It is a huge day for the club,"" said committee member Chris Tanner. ""Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special.
""The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different.
""Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.""
The Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players.
In previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient.
The FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message.
In order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place.
The above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story.

934,"Evans recorded a time of 55 minutes 40 seconds to take the yellow jersey from Andy Schleck before Sunday's largely ceremonial final stage in Paris.
Germany's Tony Martin won the time-trial from Evans, who moved 1:34 ahead of Schleck in the overall standings.
Schleck began the day with a 53-second lead in the general classification.
The Luxembourger is destined for a third consecutive second place in the Tour after the aggression that secured his stage win over the Galibier on Thursday  appeared to catch up with him.
Evans, a general classification runner-up in 2008 and 2009, was visibly emotional as he was presented with the yellow jersey.
In the absence of Alberto Contador in 2008, the Australian was widely expected to land his first Grand Tour title but was foiled by Carlos Sastre.
""Fortunately this year, we're close to Paris"", Evans added after Saturday's dramatic stage.
""This is the result of a lot of planning and experience. This is my seventh Tour de France and not having bad luck has been good to me.
""In 2008 I suffered so much with my injuries it was the hardest Tour.""
Evans last wore yellow after stage eight of last year's tour, but his time at the front of the field lasted only a day as Schleck took over in the mountains.
Back on the flat in this year's decisive stage, the time-trial specialist, took revenge in ruthless style.
The 34-year-old soon eliminated the four-second gap that had separated him from  Schleck's older brother Frank before powering away to register a stage time 2:31 superior to Andy.
The Schlecks will have the small consolation of being the first set of brothers to feature in the same Tour de France podium after Frank successfully defended his third place in the overall standings.
But barring a freak accident or illness Evans, the road race world champion in 2009, will be crowned Tour de France winner on Sunday.
The final 95km run into Paris is traditionally not contested by the general classification contenders as the sprinters take centre stage on the Champs-Elysees.
""I really can't quite believe it right now. I have been concentrating on this one event for so long,"" said Evans, who came within seven seconds of decorating his success with a stage win.
Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme added: ""This is the victory of a complete rider. It is the consecration of a career.""
Thomas Voeckler, who held yellow for 10 days before Friday, is fourth in the overall standings after coming 13th on the day with a typically gritty ride.
The Frenchman is 37 seconds ahead of Contador, who came third on the day, 1:06 off Tony Martin's winning stage time.
After starting in damp conditions earlier in the day, Fabian Cancellara, the world and Olympic time-trial champion and many people's favourite for the stage, was eighth fastest.

7834,"Reports suggest Chinese buyers are acquiring the clothing retailer, which started in London in the 1850s.
Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant.
But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%.
Hong Kong-based YGM Trading, which bought it for £15m four years ago, said Aquascutum is due to be sold in March 2017 to two buyers.
The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week.
Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg.
Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile.
Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest.
The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key.
However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration.
Under YGM's ownership, the company's primary focus has been China, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Last year it closed 14 stores in China amid declining sales, but opened one in Europe.

1088,"That would be Britain's best medal haul at a Winter Games since winning a gold, silver and bronze in Germany in 1936.
And the funding body predicts there could be as many as seven medals - beating GB's best ever tally of four from Chamonix in 1924. At least two Paralympic medals are also expected.
Team GB boss Mike Hay said: ""We view the target as a vote of confidence.""
Britain won only one medal at each of the past two Winter Olympics, with Amy Williams's skeleton gold in Vancouver four years ago the country's first solo gold at a Winter Games for 30 years.
The best chances of podium finishes in Sochi lie with World Cup leader Lizzy Yarnold and world champion Shelley Rudman in skeleton, freestyle skier James Woods in the new Olympic event of slopestyle and the women's curling team.
Speed skater Elise Christie is also a medal contender, while Eve Muirhead's curling rink are the current world champions and picked up silver medals at the European Championships in November.
Visually-impaired skiers Kelly Gallagher and Jade Etherington will be hoping to come away with Britain's first-ever gold medals at the Paralympic Games while the wheelchair curlers will bid to better the silver they won in Turin in 2006.
Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, said: ""If achieved, this would demonstrate the fantastic momentum created by London 2012, where additional investment and focus on developing our high-performance system has benefited summer and winter sports alike.""

9708,"The ""cradle of the Arab Spring"" will this time see officials of the former government taking part in the election, prompting interim President Moncef Marzouki to call it a contest between ""supporters of the revolution and supporters of the counter-revolution"".
The system is based on proportional representation, with each of the country's regions having a fixed number of seats based on population.
Lists of candidates are drawn up by parties, coalitions and independents and endorsed by the overseeing body, the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE).
Some five million Tunisians have registered to vote. Candidates must be aged 23 or over and have held Tunisian nationality for at least 10 years.
According to ISIE, 49% of newly-registered voters are women. And the 26 January 2014 constitution introduced - for the first time in the Arab world - parity between men and women in elections.
The law stipulates that women should comprise 50% of all electoral lists and there must be an equal number of lists headed by women and men.
Tunisian women take a 'step backwards'
Tunisia's election process means that no party is likely to win a majority of seats in the renamed National Assembly. However, political observers agree - in the absence of opinion polls, which are banned during the campaign - that the favourites are the Islamist Ennahda Movement and their secular opponents, the liberal Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call).
A number of other parties are in contention, including the centre-ground secular Congress for the Republic (CPR) and secular Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberty (FDTL or Ettakatol) and those led by former officials of Ben Ali's regime.
Most candidates claim to have the economy at the heart of their campaign, realising that poverty and unemployment were the main factors that triggered the 14 January revolution in 2011.
Ennahda won 89 of 217 seats in 2011 and led a coalition government with CPR and FDTL. It lost power in January following street protests but hopes to make a comeback. It has said it is willing to form a coalition with any other party.
Nidaa Tounes wants to rally nationalist and liberal supporters to weaken the position of Ennahda. It was founded by Beji Caid Essebsi, a former transitional prime minister, and enjoys the support of the Tunisian General Labour Union and some business groups. Nidaa says it will not contemplate any coalition with Ennahda until that groups ""clarifies"" its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East and North Africa.
Congress for the Republic (CPR) is led by interim President Marzouki and won 29 seats in 2011.
Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties was founded in 1994 by National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Djaafar. It won 20 seats in 2011.
Popular Front is a coalition of five left-wing and Baathist parties led by Hamma Hammami. It played an important role in mobilising street protests to bring down two Ennahda-led governments. The Front parties, however, do not seem to have significant electoral support.
The al-Qaeda-affiliated Okba Ibn Nafaa battalion, active on Tunisia's border with Algeria, has threatened to disrupt the election.
Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou has said his ministry has plans in hand to deal with the ""terrorist"" threat, which he described as ""serious"". Tunisia is to mobilize 50,000 security officers and nearly 20,000 soldiers to secure the election.
Tunisians have shown only ""lukewarm interest"", according to al-Jazeera TV on 20 October. Tunisian academic Abdellatif Hanachi told al-Jazeera that this is partly because of the difficult economic and social conditions in the country.
He added that voter apathy was due to a ""sense of frustration"" among a broad section of people at the failure to fulfil revolutionary promises. However, he concluded that this could all change on polling day, as it did in 2011.

The expected success of the Islamist-leaning Enahda party, however, has led to concerns that the womens' rights clauses in the constitution may be slowly eroded.

10827,"The man, 41, was helped from the Audi TT which had been driven at speed into Carr Mill reservoir in St Helens on Monday evening, Merseyside Police said.
Five officers were filmed rescuing him from the slowly sinking vehicle.
The man was found to be uninjured when taken to hospital. He was detained on suspicion of a number of offences.
These included the unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle, burglary, dangerous driving and failing to stop, police said.
Officers started tracking the suspected stolen Audi in Liverpool at about 20:20 GMT.
When police attempted to stop the car, the driver sped off, leading to a police pursuit up the M62.
Officers deployed a stop-stick before the Audi continued to be driven at speed and finally into the reservoir.
The officers who went into the water were also checked over as a precaution and have all been released.
Ch Supt Jon Ward said: ""The officers involved in this pursuit and rescue acted with exceptional bravery, tenacity and professionalism to rescue the man on a bitterly cold, wet and miserable evening.
""Without a second thought given to their own safety and the conditions, they entered the freezing water and dragged him through the rear of the car just before it became completely submerged.""",Helicopter footage of officers wading into icy waters to rescue a man who had driven a suspected stolen car into a reservoir has been released by police.,38069308,xsum,"Merseyside police officers have been hailed for their bravery after they rescued a man from an Audi TT which was driven into the Carr Mill reservoir in St Helens, UK on 30 November.

7081,"New rules come in on 1 January, which will reduce compensation to £75,000 per person, per institution.
Previously the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protected savings of up to £85,000 per account.
Joint accounts will see protection cut from £170,000 to £150,000.
The maximum compensation across the European Union is set at €100,000, and the British level was reduced as a result of the pound gaining strength against the euro.
The precise rate was set on 3 July 2015.
At the time, one senior Tory MP described the change as ""defective"".
Although 95% of savers will still be protected, as many as 2.5 million people may not be, according to the FSCS. It is advising savers who have more than £75,000 in one account, or in one institution, to move their money if necessary.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that some registered banks and building societies operate under more than one brand.
So it you had £75,000 savings with HSBC, for example, any additional savings in First Direct would not be protected, as both banks have a joint licence.
Savers using Bank of Scotland and Halifax are in the same position.
But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest - although they are sister banks - are both registered separately. So savers could safely have up to £75,000 in accounts with both banks.
""While this should be quite simple to navigate, it's made complicated by the fact that FSCS cover is shared between banks that operate under the same licence,"" said Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a full list of registered banks, and which brands come under the same umbrella.
Under the new rules, savers who have up to £1m in their accounts temporarily - as a result of selling a house, or being made redundant, for example - are also protected.
To receive compensation, they cannot have had that cash in their accounts for more than six months.
A further warning comes in relation to some foreign banks which trade in the UK, but are registered within the eurozone, such as Germany's Fidor Bank, or Sweden's Handelsbanken.
Handelsbanken confirmed that the level of compensation would depend on the exchange rate at the time.
So depending on how much €100,000 is worth in pounds, savers may get more or less than £75,000 protection. At the time of writing, that amount is worth less than £74,000.
""With an increasing number of European banks now offering competitive rates, customers need to be aware that not all savings accounts offered in the UK are covered by the UK compensation scheme,"" said Rachel Thrussell, savings insight manager at Moneyfacts.co.uk.","Millions of savers are being reminded that they may need to move some of their cash, to guarantee it will be fully protected in the event of their bank going bust.",35168696,xsum,"New rules from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) will come into effect on January 1, which will reduce account compensation to £75,000 per person, per institution.
