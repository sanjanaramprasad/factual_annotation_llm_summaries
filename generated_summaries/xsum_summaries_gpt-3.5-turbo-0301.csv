0,0,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"".

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria.

6,6,"Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

8,8,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

12,12,"The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

14,14,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.

15,15,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.""

Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset.

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC.

36,36,"Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

40,40,"Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks.

Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life.""

44,44,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent.

Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed.

49,49,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk.

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers.

Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found.

""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman.""

Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential.

Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",xsum,"St Hilda's Church in Ellerburn, North York Moors, is struggling to keep the 11th Century building clean and free of an ""appalling smell"" caused by protected bats, despite spending over £10,000 and building new lofts in an attempt to get them to move out.","A colony of protected bats living in St Hilda's Church, Ellerburn, is causing damage and an unbearable smell, with volunteers and £10,000 having been spent on persuading them to move out, but Natural England is requiring adequate alternative roosts before sealing up access points and moving them elsewhere.",bcb76cacd4ea11edaf5f1b63c3919b11

62,62,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings.

67,67,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym.

68,68,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.

The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site.

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"".

76,76,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!""

Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries.

The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.

For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"". He added: ""We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. ""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

88,88,"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.

91,91,"Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of ""almost unendurable"" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",xsum,"Sport funding in Scotland is facing a 20% cut, with reductions blamed on lower government spending and lottery ticket sales, while fears are growing that job losses will hit governing bodies and potentially compromise its performance at future international sporting events.

The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers.

There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas.

99,99,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.
