3010,"While Easter in the UK is celebrated with chocolate eggs and a roast lamb, in Greece they mark the day slightly differently - and a week later. As Orthodox Easter Sunday was held, thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional ‘mock war’. Dozens of brave souls even attend the late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani while the annual battle is held – even when the structures and surrounding homes are ringed in defensive veils of chicken wire. Fortunately, severe injuries are rare in Vrontados during the fiery celebrations. Although small firework displays are held at churches around the country at midnight services on Easter Saturday - despite official disapproval from Church officials - Vrontados is in a league of its own, drawing spectators from all over Greece and abroad. The custom dates back to the 19th century, when the island was under Turkish occupation, but may have older roots. Preparations last all year, while on the Saturday morning participants parade their hardware through the village in lorries, honking their horns. Easter Sunday was celebrated in services across Europe, with thousands of people attending church in Greece, Russia, Turkey and the Balkans to mark the most important day of the Christian calendar - Jesus Christ's resurrection from the dead. Russian president Vladimir Putin attended the Easter Sunday service in Moscow, meeting with the Patriach of Moscow and all Russia Kirill, while Pope Francis held a commemorative service in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican with Armenian clergy to mark 100 years since the Armenian Genocide.

1287,"Niki Lauda is fully expecting Nico Rosberg to turn 'nasty' at some stage after accusing the German and team-mate Lewis Hamilton of being 'egocentric b*******'. Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two at the Shanghai International Circuit, claiming his fourth Chinese Grand Prix victory and the 35th overall of his Formula One career. Rosberg, though, effectively accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference after the reigning champion slowed in the middle stint of the race to preserve his soft tyres. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda (right) pictured by the circuit in his recognisable red cap . Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage . That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.' Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate . Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday . Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with McLaren's Fernando Alonso 12th and Jenson Button 14th. Button had finished 13th, but was handed a five-second post-race penalty for an accident with Lotus' Pastor Maldonado that ended the Venezuelan's grand prix. In his first race with Manor, after missing the first two due to issues, Will Stevens was 15th, finishing ahead of team-mate Roberto Merhi.","Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of Nico Rosberg .

2119,"It was only three months ago that they realised their dream of having their first child. Now Luke Harris and Daryl Lee are celebrating the birth of their second baby. And the gay couple are due to become fathers for the third time in just a few weeks after controversially enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers. Scroll down for video . Luke Harris and Daryl Lee, from Surrey, had their first child three months ago and are now preparing to welcome their third baby into the world after enlisting the help of three surrogate mothers. Pictured (from left): Pregnant surrogate Becky Harris, Mr Lee with son Phoenix Harris and his surrogate mother Bex Harris (behind), Mr Harris holding daughter Willow-Star  and her surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis (right) The couple, who met in 1999 and became civil partners in 2012, celebrated the birth of their first child, son Phoenix Blue (left with Mr Harris), on January 14. They welcomed daughter Willow-Star (right with Mr Lee) after surrogate Viktoria Ellis gave birth on February 25 . Phoenix Blue (left) was born naturally after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz, while Willow-Star was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate Viktoria Ellis’s home after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the dads’ were woken by a text saying: ‘Your girl is here!’ Showing off baby number two for the first time, the civil partners told how their rapidly expanding brood has left them exhausted but elated. The latest addition is daughter Willow-Star Shirley Harris-Lee. She was born a healthy 7lb at surrogate mother Viktoria Ellis’s home on February 25 – after a 25-minute labour that was so quick the gay dads’ were woken by a text message saying: ‘Your little girl is here!’ First child Phoenix Blue Harris-Lee – a boy – was born naturally on January 14 after a 16-hour induced labour, weighing 7lb 15oz. His surrogate mother was Bex Harris, Viktoria’s best friend. Baby number three – known to be a boy – is being carried by Bex’s sister-in-law Becky Harris and is due in July. The birth will mean Mr Harris – who is not related to the two mothers – and Mr Lee will have completed their family of three within seven months. Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer from Surrey, said: ‘Going from having an empty home to having two precious babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind, but even after weeks of feeding on demand we feel overjoyed. ‘We are relishing every moment of becoming dads. We spent 15 years fearing we’d never be able to have children, so while at times, as every parent knows, you are completely knackered, the sense of elation far outweighs any negatives.’ He described becoming fathers as ‘life-affirming and life-changing’ for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist. ‘We now truly understand what unconditional love means – the only downside is that we don’t go to the pub any more!’ said Mr Harris. ‘We now don’t look at ourselves as a couple, we are a family unit, and fiercely protective of our little clan.’ Mr Harris, 51, a computer programmer (pictured left holding Willow-Star), described becoming fathers as ‘life-affirming and life-changing’ for himself and Mr Lee, 41, a dentist (right with Phoenix Blue). He said: 'Having two babies in a such a short period has been a whirlwind' Happy families: Pictured from left to right, Bex Harris, Daryl Lee holding Phoenix, Luke Harris with Willow-Star and Viktoria Ellis . Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) will soon be joined by another sibling when surrogate Becky Harris gives birth to a boy in July . Phoenix (right) was born using Bex Harris’s eggs and Mr Lee’s sperm while Willow-Star (left) was created using Viktoria’s eggs and Mr Harris’s sperm, meaning they are not biologically connected. The couple’s third child, yet to be born, was created using Mr Lee’s sperm . Willow-Star was delivered by Viktoria’s neighbour in Suffolk, who happens to be Bex’s mother, Karen Harris, who also runs the internet surrogacy forum where the women and fathers met. Mr Harris and Mr Lee drove there as soon as they could. ‘When we arrived at Viktoria’s house our beautiful daughter was snuggled up in blankets, looking so tiny and vulnerable and she was absolutely perfect in every way,’ Mr Harris said. After a hospital check-up, the couple took Willow home to meet Phoenix, who was born using Bex’s eggs and Mr Lee’s sperm. As Willow was created using Viktoria’s eggs and Mr Harris’s sperm, they are not biologically connected. The couple looked into adoption before deciding to have children using surrogates, after reading about Sir Elton John and David Furnish becoming fathers through surrogacy. After the birth of their third child, the couple will have become a family of three in seven months . Their most recent child is daughter Willow-Star who was born via surrogate Viktoria Ellis (centre holding Willow). Mr Lee (pictured right holding 11-week-old Phoenix) and Mr Harris said they were a little daunted by the prospect of a third child but will take it in their stride . Mr Lee (pictured left with Willow-Star) and Mr Harris (right with Phoenix), who met in 1999 before becoming civil partners in 2012, said: 'While we may not meet some people’s idea of a traditional family, all our children will be cherished in a stable, loving environment’ Mr Harris said: ‘As far as we’re concerned Phoenix (left) and Willow-Star (right) are brother and sister and that’s how they’ll be brought up' The couple’s, as yet unborn, son was created using Mr Lee’s sperm, meaning he will be Phoenix’s half-brother.

6532,"The superstitious will know – or perhaps those who have seen Alfred Hitchcock's classic film The Birds – that a bird in the house is a bad omen and one that is said to equate to death. So a family in Texas would  be forgiven for being slightly put out about the fact that their home became infested with them. According to the video maker, who returns home with the other people in the clip to find the infestation, the birds came in through the chimney. The video maker stated that he initially thought the intruders were bats but now believes them to be sparrows . Capturing them on camera as they fly around the room, the man remains very calm while narrating on the carnage before him – birds crashing into the walls and flying overhead. He says: ‘There are birds everywhere, what the hell, look at this,’ before reiterating his point and recoiling as one crashes into him. A female voice then speaks out – also extremely calmly considering the fact the front room has been turned into an aviary. Despite the infestation of birds in their front room, the family remain very calm throughout the video . According to the video maker the birds managed to invade the house through the chimney . The lady says: ‘Careful not to step on them,’ as the video maker points out that some of the birds appear to be dying, as they lie on the ground. The filmmaker then states: ‘This is awful,’ and suggests that the group need to find a way to get the birds out of the house. The video concludes with the filmmaker continuing to record the birds as they circle the room and bounce off the walls. The video maker states that the scene is awful as a number of birds crash into the walls and end up on the floor . According to the video maker there were around 30 birds in the front room when the group came home. Speaking on another video, he also states that he initially thought they were bats before realising they were birds and potentially sparrows.","Family stay remarkably calm as birds fly around the room .

4023,"Who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? Had you asked that question 12 months ago, the answer would have been glaring: Luis Suarez. For his 31 goals and his breathtaking displays, the accolade could only have gone to the Uruguayan. It was not, though, a case of him operating alone. Had it been a ‘normal’ season, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling would all have been worthy recipients. But they were not the only contenders. Jordan Henderson was outstanding. Martin Skrtel was a big presence. Luis Suarez was clearly Liverpool's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign . Steven Gerrard (left) and Phillippe Coutinho (front) also played well as Liverpool's title tilt fell short . The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Fast forward to the present and ask the same question: who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? There is no obvious candidate. Henderson, of course, would have his backers. The England international has excelled since the turn of the year, while Coutinho would command his share of the vote. Brendan Rodgers suggested after the Brazilian’s fabulous goal against Manchester City on March 1 he might be a contender for PFA Young Player of Year but, at times since, his flame has not flickered so brightly. Sterling had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes. Emre Can has caught the eye since Christmas, while results have been better with Lucas Leiva in the team; Liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started. And that explains why Liverpool are where they are at the moment. There have been lots of satisfactory contributions, a few excellent, but there hasn’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago. Jordan Henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy . Coutinho has again played well and won the game for Liverpool to send them into the FA Cup semi-finals . Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). It is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for Champions League places and why they have made such heavy weather of this FA Cup campaign. For long periods here they flattered to deceive. Sterling saw little of the ball and Sturridge continued to show how out of form he is. The goals have dried up for Rodgers’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game. Rodgers must have feared the worst as Simon Mignolet kept his side’s Wembley dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period, but then, much to his relief, up popped Coutinho. There is still time, of course, for one of Rodgers’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch; on May 19, a gala dinner will be held at the city’s Echo Arena when the successor to Suarez will be announced. Daniel Sturridge's injury-hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out-of-sorts striker . Raheem Sterling was denied of service at Ewood Park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel . At this moment, nobody is better placed than Coutinho. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given Liverpool’s implosion — and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian. He proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at Ewood Park. Rodgers needs him to show that right through until the end of May.","Luis Suarez was Liverpool's player of last season .

7477,"As Australian Fashion Week comes to a close, a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in Australia and their companies, for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed.

'The day before the game I told him: 'This game we will never lose. Never.' 'But we needed to win.

Hazard also believes he is having the best season of his career as Chelsea close in on the Barclays Premier League title. The Chelsea winger said: 'I'm playing my best season ever. With my experience, I succeed to manage the strong and weak moments in a game better. 'Last year I played a good season, but I disappeared in some games.

9213,"When it launched eight years ago, cruise company Azamara decided to make a name for itself, literally. The founders took 'aza' for 'blue' - think azure; and added 'mara', which has a hint of the maritime about it. And then, for good measure, they bolted on 'Club Cruises'. The thinking behind 'Club' was that it suggested exclusivity. The line - part of the Royal Caribbean group - has two ships in its fleet, Journey and Quest, which each carry about 680 passengers. The smaller size of the vessels means not only a more intimate on-board experience - as in TV's Cheers bar, it can become a place where everybody who serves you soon knows your name - it also means the ships can access ports off-limits to the bigger vessels. I boarded our seven-night Azamara Quest cruise from Monaco to Rome with a sense of great expectations: I anticipated a friendly ambience, great service and some interesting ports. I wasn't to be disappointed. The Azamara Club Cruises' Quest vessel carries about 680 passengers, making it a more intimate voyage . The size of the ship means it is able to access ports that are off-limits to the bigger vessels . Boarding the ship in somewhere as glitzy as Monaco immediately imbued the journey with a luxury feel. In the harbour we were surrounded on all sides by billionaires' mega-yachts. But while they and their guests were probably having to fork out vast amounts for their onboard food and drink, on the Azamara Quest we were living in the lap of complimentary luxury. You can enjoy 'standard spirits, international beers and wines at all ship bars during regular bar hours' for no extra charge - and 'gratuities' on Azamara are included in the basic cost. There is also an unfeasibly wide selection of on-board eating places - there is a Tardis-like feel to the way that something that looks small from the outside can accommodate so much on the inside. Our first stop was St Tropez, which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than Monaco. In the evening we joined a small party for a special excursion - Azamara prides itself on offering a variety of experiences throughout its cruises - to an 'elegant evening under the stars' at a favourite celeb hangout, the five-star Chateau de La Messardiere. We gathered around the handsome swimming pool to sip fine champagne and scoff sumptuous mini-pastries as we watched the sun sink into the Mediterranean. Frank boarded a seven-night Azamara Quest cruise from Monaco to Rome with high expectations . The first stop was St Tropez , which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than Monaco . It was a good time to get early impressions on the cruise from fellow passengers. Everyone was impressed at the high quality of service and facilities - especially those whose previous cruise experiences had been on 'big' ships. There were high marks for dining, service, decor, the interesting choice of excursions and the excellent value for money. 'We were worried Azamara might be too small,' said one couple. 'In fact we should have been worried by the fact that our previous trips had been on ships which were too large. We're sticking with ships this size from now on.' The days flew by. There were two ports in Corsica: Ajaccio and Porto Vecchio. Famous for its salt pans, Porto Vecchio offered another treat - the AzaMazing evening (there is one on every cruise), a large, free-of-charge party with masses of food, wine and entertainment laid on at a nearby beach that we reached in a fleet of coaches. It felt as if we were gatecrashing an exclusive private party. Famous for its salt pans, Porto Vecchio offered another treat - a large free-of-charge private party . The cruises attracted a wide spread of age groups, from people in their 30s up to their 80s. The accent was on keeping busy, whether by taking interesting excursions or attending well-thought-out lectures on board. But if you didn't want to do anything, there were always spare sunloungers and plenty of space to stretch out next to the pool. After a fine stop at Sardinia, it was on to Italy for Capri and our final stop at Amalfi. I woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past Positano. It was so quiet that as we sailed past the small villages, you could hear bells calling people to morning Mass. Frank woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past quiet Positano . In Amalfi we caught the local bus up to Ravello - once a favourite place with the Hollywood elite - to enjoy the stunning views along the coast, and then sauntered back down the footpath through lemon trees and sweet-smelling shade until we were back in Amalfi. Our final excursion was one that promised 'Insider Access' - a drive along the spectacular Amalfi Coast to a buffalo farm in Pontecagnano to discover how mozzarella cheese is made. A bus up to former Hollywood elite favourite Ravello is rewarded with coastal views such as this . One of the happy Asian water buffalo that provide the milk for creamy and delicious mozzarella . Azamara Club Cruises (0844 493 4016) offers an eight-night Mediterranean cruise aboard the Quest from £2,285pp including return flights from Heathrow, transfers, club balcony cabin and full board. Departing October 15, it calls at Florence and Pisa, Rome, Sorrento, Sicily, Crete, Santorini and Athens. I'm not sure what sort of picture I had in my head of the buffaloes from which the milk is taken in order to make the famous Italian cheese, but the big-horned Asian water buffaloes we met came as something of a surprise. The farm we visited was a showpiece with a big herd of cheerful animals, and after watching the manufacturing process we were whisked off to the owners' farmhouse where we were able to sample the goods in rural splendour. On our return to the ship there was time to reflect on a pleasurable week at sea. The company's name may mean 'blue sea' - for me I will always remember it as 'my blue heaven'.","Writer took Azamara Club Cruises' Quest vessel from Monaco to Rome .

1897,"In an effort to counter rival Netflix's entry into the Australian market, cable TV's Foxtel will launch the third season of the critically acclaimed US women's prison drama Orange is the New Black by screening every episode in a full season marathon. A kink in the agreement with US studio Lionsgate - under which both Foxtel and rival Netflix share the rights - allows Foxtel to offer episodes of the series as an on-demand streaming title as well. Pedestrian.TV website reports that the one lingering issue that adversely affects Netflix's operations in Australia is pre-existing distribution deals cut for its original shows in markets where, previously, it didn't exist. Taylor Schilling (left) is the main character in Netflix series Orange is the New Black . In Australia, this applies to the way Orange is the New Black was shown 'legally' in the country, leaving the door open for Foxtel to screen the series. Foxtel's priority distribution is the traditional one episode at a time airing method. And all episodes must air in this manner before they can offer the program as an on demand option. However, when the third season of the prison drama premieres on Netflix on June 12, Foxtel will also begin showing the entire season in one continuous marathon, beginning at the same time. The established prison drama is currently one of Netflix's flagship TV shows . Doing this means that when the marathon is completed around 14 or so hours later, Foxtel can then upload the entire season and offer the episodes on an on-demand basis for customers. The popular TV series is based on the book of the same name, by Piper Kerman, about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth. It's a cast that includes Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Australian actress Yael Stone. The TV series is about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth . The Sydney Morning Herald reports that former MTV Australia and Foxtel presenter Ruby Rose appears in the show's third season, reportedly as a prisoner who becomes in involved with both Piper (Schilling) and Alex (Laura Prepon). In the US, the series is one of the major titles for Netflix there, though the organisation recently clashed with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which controls the Emmy Awards, over whether the show is considered a comedy or a drama. The upshot is that Orange is the New Black must now compete as a drama at this year's Emmy Awards, a move which means the series will compete directly against Netflix's other flagship show House of Cards.

","Foxtel, an Australian cable TV provider, is countering Netflix's entry into the Australian market by offering a full season marathon of the third season of Orange is the New Black. Although Netflix and Foxtel share the rights under an agreement with US studio Lionsgate, there is a kink that allows Foxtel to offer the series as an on-demand streaming title as well. The one issue that affects Netflix's operations in Australia is pre-existing distribution deals cut for their original shows in markets where, previously, it didn't exist. As for Foxtel, their priority distribution is the traditional one-episode-at-a-time airing method; however, when the third season premieres on Netflix, Foxtel will screen the entire season marathon-style and then upload it as an on-demand option for their customers.

1081,"(CNN)Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries: . • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.","Ohio Gov. John Kasich: Washington is gridlocked, but states can make a difference .

7824,"The cringeworthy, yet strangely addicting footage of whiteheads being popped, cysts being ruptured and blackheads being extracted has turned a dermatologist into an internet sensation as thousands of people flock to her video channel to catch a glimpse of 'Dr Pimple Popper' in action. Dr Sandra Lee is dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and a regular guest on The Doctors talk show, but online she is known simply as Dr Pimple Popper, a moniker she used when she started posting clips of her patients' extractions on her YouTube channel. The clips have earned her nearly 60,000 subscribers, as well as loyal fan base of zit squeezing enthusiasts on Reddit. 'I find this little subculture fascinating,' Dr Lee told Racked of her followers. 'I pop these things, and yeah they kind of make me feel good, they’re satisfying, but it’s not like I seek them out.' Scroll down for video . All in a day's work: Dermatologist Dr Sandra Lee, who known as Dr Pimple Popper online, shares videos of herself extracting her patients zits on her popular YouTube channel . Day job: Dr Lee, from Upland, California, can be seen using a comedone extractor to pop one of her patient's blemishes . Dr Lee explained that when a patient comes in she offers to tackle their blemishes in exchange for them allowing her to post the videos of the process online, while keeping the clips as anonymous as she can. And she noted that, despite the somewhat gruesome nature of her YouTube channel, 'nobody ever says no'. Before she shot to internet fame, Dr Lee's channel, used to only feature a selection of TV segments that she had done, only had a few thousand followers. However, when she joined Instagram, she started posting short clips of her actually treating patients, a decision which quickly garnered her much more interest, prompting her to start putting full-length clips up on YouTube, starting with a video of her extracting a man's blackheads. 'I didn’t realize how big it would be,' she said of the video, which has received more than 360,000 views since it was posted in December. Dr Lee explained that she was such an 'amateur' at the time; she barely knew anything about Reddit and was 'floored' when she learned that her video was being shared on a popular pimple popping subreddit. The experience opened her eyes to an entire community that she had no idea existed. The doctor, who is now well-known on the subreddit, said the people are 'really wonderful'. Big break: Dr Lee became an internet sensations after she posted this video of herself extracting a man's blackheads on YouTube. The clips was later shared on Reddit and helped her to earn a loyal fan base . But Dr Lee questions whether she is a 'true popper' because she doesn't actually enjoy watching people squeeze and poke their whiteheads and cysts on their own. 'I don’t watch any of the other videos,' she said. 'They all kind of gross me out! When they’re amateur, I don’t want to hear screaming, I don’t like that stuff.' But pimple popping has quickly become a key part of Dr Lee's occupation. In fact, it's basically the family business; both her father and her husband are dermatologists as well. According to Dr Lee the most popular types of popping are the extractions of blackheads and whiteheads, and she has now come to learn that there are two different varieties of video – ‘a soft pop and a hard pop'. 'Some people just like blackheads, it’s like soft porn, a soft pop,' she noted. 'And then there’s a hard pop, where people like more of a cyst.' In March, Dr Lee posted a 'best of soft pop' video montage has been viewed more than 500,000 since it was posted last month. 'I've been listening to you guys, and I hear that there are two general groups of you PimplePoppaholics: Some like the SoftPop, some prefer the HardPop!' she wrote in the description. 'Of course, some of you like it all, but I thought I would try to make as many of you happy as I can. Here's a Soft Pop Best Of... I'll have a HardPop Best Of later today for you. Enjoy! [sic]' Free time: The dermatologist, pictured in a selfie posted on her Instagram account, is now well-known among the pimple popping community on Reddit . Basic extraction: Dr Lee said videos of blackheads and whiteheads being removed (pictured) are most popular . And many commenters lauded Dr Lee for her rapport with her patients. Dr Lee, who uses her iPhone and iMovie to shoot and edit the videos, told Racked that she likes to show the 'human side' of her patients by having them share their back story. She said that her favorite clips are of a patient she calls 'Pop', who recently lost his wife to a 'chronic, painful sickness'. 'What's amazing is that what started as a video of my squeezing the blackheads on his nose has transformed into the wonderful feel-good human interest story,' she told Daily Mail Online. She continued: 'They were inseparable, and he has had trouble adjusting to his new life in an assisted living facility. He has both financial and emotional stress, and he tells a little of his story in his videos.' After hearing Pop's struggles, Dr Lee's YouTube and Reddit followers asked her to start him a GoFundMe page so they could help him financially. The page, which was started on April 15, has already already exceeded its $5,000 goal - raising $5,665 in just eight days. Family business: Dr Lee can be seen with her husband Dr Jeffrey Rebish, who is also a dermatologist . Addicting videos: Dr Lee can be seen extracting a blackhead from one of her patients . 'He knows a little about what is going on, but doesn't know yet how much people have donated to help him out in his current situation,' she explained. 'He would be shocked to hear that well wishes are coming from all over the world.' One commenter who made a donation noted: 'This gentleman reminds me of my grandpa. I wish him all the best, he is such a gentle soul. Lots of love from a French girl in the UK x [sic].' Dr Lee said she plans on visiting him in his new home and present him with all the cards, messages and money that people have given him next week. 'I can't wait to see how surprised and touched he will be,' she said. As for her extraction technique, Dr Lee told Racked that it's 'not completely sterile', but she uses clean gloves and a comedone extractor, which she said costs less than $20. Although she warned that people shouldn't pop their pimples because they can risk scarring, she admitted that she is guilty of squeezing her own zits at home. For people who absolutely have to pick, Dr Lee advised them to use a warm compress and prick the blemish with a sterile needle when it comes to a head. But she he added that she can't ensure anyone that they aren't going to scar when they take matters into their own hands. Dr Lee, who is also a skin cancer surgeon and a cosmetic surgeon, explained that she has posted videos of her doing other procedures, but people aren't as interested in them. 'People might construe that I’m addicted to this stuff, but I’m not,' she said of work as Dr Pimple Popper. 'This isn’t everything that I do. In fact, it’s a very small part.'","Dr Sandra Lee is a dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and is a regular guest on talk show The Doctors .

5655,"On a fenced-in artificial pitch, on the edge of one of Salford's most notorious estates, a group of men with what you could call lived-in faces are finishing a game of football. Some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots. Stories of strife are swapped. 'I'm only here so I can get a shower,'  says one as he rolls a cigarette. 'The wife booted me out a week ago and I've been on a settee since.' Jesper Blomqvist helped coach youngsters from Manchester United Foundation's Street Red project . Another is reflecting on how this kickabout, for those who may have suffered from mental health issues, is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink. 'I was on a bridge over a motorway,' he says as he looks into the distance. 'They sectioned me for five years.' Into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity. Jesper Blomqvist, he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast, is back in Manchester. The Swede, now 41, was a key cog in Sir Alex Ferguson's treble-winning machine, making 38 appearances in that memorable season following a £4.4m switch from Parma. The midfielder (left) was a crucial player in Manchester United's treble winning season of 1998-99 . But his 67 minutes in the late, late Champions League Final win over Bayern Munich in Barcelona would be his last in a red shirt. Three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to Everton but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement. He is here on Sunday to coach youngsters from the Manchester United Foundation's Street Reds project, but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch. Blomqvist now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences . The years have been kind. Blomqvist's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs. 'I lecture with my brother,' he explains. 'He's a psychologist so he talks about how to handle setbacks and how to keep on performing. I can relate to that and give some real life examples from my career both good times and bad times. We speak to people from companies who have team building days.' Blomqvist celebrates their semi-final win over Juventus with Steve McClaren (centre) and Dwight Yorke . Blomqvist had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for United in 1998. He was one of few players Sir Alex Ferguson had to try more than once to convince to move to the club, after he spurned the Scotsman's advances to sign for Parma and Carlo Ancelotti after a frustrating year on AC Milan's bench. 'I liked Italy,' he explains, apologetically. 'It was nothing to do with Manchester. I had learned the language and I had settled in. I enjoyed the life and I enjoyed Parma, but then Carlo Ancelotti left.' Blomqvist revealed that he rejected Sir Alex Ferguson the first time and signed for Parma in 1997 . Sir Alex Ferguson came back again and managed to sign up his man to compete with Ryan Giggs . Back came a determined Ferguson and this time he was successful, bringing Blomqvist to the club to compete with Ryan Giggs on the left. It went well. In that treble-winning year Blomqvist picked up three medals, although one was almost consigned to Catalonian turf in the celebrations that followed United's belief-defying victory over Bayern at the Nou Camp. 'I don't remember much about that night,' he reveals. 'It was high tension. Afterwards it was joy. I lost my medal on the pitch jumping around and I had to start looking for it. I was scared but I found it in the end.' The Swede (bottom left) started for United in the Champions League final victory against Bayern Munich . The Red Devils were involved in one of the most exciting comebacks of all time after winning the trophy . United have a quite sensational season, winning the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League . Then came injury. Blomqvist went under the knife three times and it was here where he learned the lessons he now passes on. 'You try to get your head down,' he says. 'Small goals. In a few weeks I can go on the bike, then a few more and I can go running. But it's hours and hours of rehab and you feel like an outcast. You lose the connection with everyone, especially if it goes on for a long time.' Eventually Ferguson called him into his office for the inevitable chat. Blomqvist in action for United during the 1999 Champions League final where they completed the treble . 'I remember that last discussion because I felt quite guilty,' he says. 'I had been injured for so long and they kept paying the wages. He said 'don't worry, this is football - you gave me one excellent year and we won everything'. 'When he said that it was as though a stone fell off my heart. It meant a lot to me that he could feel like that. 'Of course he phoned Water Smith and helped me to get a deal with Everton - it spoke volumes of him.' Blomqvist enjoyed his time at Goodison Park where he was restricted to 17 appearances. The 41-year-old had an injury hit time at Everton and only managed 17 appearances for the club . 'Without wanting to be disrespectful it was a smaller club,' he says. 'There were fewer people working there which made it feel more like a family and I enjoyed that.' During Blomqvist's nine months on Merseyside, Smith was replaced by David Moyes. 'I enjoyed playing for him,' he says. 'He was, is, a good coach. That's why I was surprised it didn't work (at United). It was always going to be really hard to take over from Sir Alex. Sometimes it's about getting the right job at the right moment. 'Maybe it was bad timing. The only thing I think he may have done wrong was to change too many of the staff. When you have such a winning concept its very dangerous to change too much. Of course he wanted to put his mark on the club so you can understand it but I think it backfired.' Blomqvist worked under Ferguson and David Moyes (right) and spoke highly of them both . After Everton, Blomqvist endured a short stint with Charlton Athletic ('I enjoyed London but I was injured all the time') before heading back to his homeland. He will, however, be back in the red shirt of Manchester United in when the club's legends team recreate that 1999 final against Bayern's veterans at Old Trafford on June 14. 'It's always competitive with Manchester United,' he says (Blomqvist set up Andy Cole for the equaliser in the 3-3 first leg at a packed Allianz Arena). 'I play with lots of the old teams I have been involved with but there's a difference with United. 'Nobody wants to lose. They are fit and ready.' Now, at last, so is he.

7772,"Married father-of-two Steven Christopher Costa, from Devon, plans to head to Iraq to fight against ISIS . A married father-of-two is set to leave his home in Devon to fight against ISIS in Iraq because jihadis 'need to be put down like rabid dogs'. Steven Christopher Costa, 31, plans to head out to the Middle East next month to join the war against the terrorists, leaving his wife and young children behind. Mr Costa, who spent six years in the Navy, will make the 4,000-mile trip after raising the cash to pay for flights. He said: 'When you have a rabid dog, you take it to the vet and put it down. 'Lots of people have said it's an admirable thing I am doing. I think it's a necessary thing.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists. The former seaman was recruited through the Foreign Fighters Against ISIS Facebook group, who help ex-military personnel make the journey to ISIS-controlled territory. He has applied for a visa and plans to fly to northern Iraq via Jordan. Mr Costa said he will take his own life if he is ever captured by the terrorists because he does not want his children to see him being executed in a Jihadi John-style video. 'I will be saving a bullet or keeping a grenade strapped to my chest,' he said. 'If I get captured, I will pull the pin and take my life so there will be nothing for them to parade in any propaganda videos. 'I won't be burnt alive and I certainly won't be beheaded. I don't want my kids to see that in 10 years' time on the internet, because it will still be there. 'I am not going to lie, I am frightened. And anyone who says they are not is lying.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists (file picture) Previous attempts by people to go out to fight ISIS have led to them being arrested for terror offences, but Mr Costa says this will not happen to him. He said: 'I'm going to join the Kurdish Peshmerga - not a terror group - who some European countries are funding and sending weapons to. 'There are a few groups of former soldiers out there so I'll be fine. I'm going as a volunteer, not a mercenary, so I don't think I'll be stopped. I'm not being paid.' The former military man added: 'Not seeing my kids is my biggest fear before death. 'People are going to have to give their lives to stop ISIS and if one of them has to be me, then so be it. Mr Costa (pictured) will leave his wife and children behind to fight against ISIS for three months . 'I am not doing it for any monetary gain and I am not doing it for fame. 'My wife was not impressed when I told her, but she understands. 'The war that's happening over there will happen over here. It's just a matter of how long it will be before it comes here.' Steven said he aims to fight against the extremists for three months before returning to his family. 'If I have committed to something, I have to see it through,' he said. Otherwise it would bug me for the rest of my life.' Terror police warned Mr Costa against the trip but do not have the power to stop him leaving unless they suspect of him of carrying out an offence. Detective Sergeant Martin Lakey from the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit, said: 'Whilst it is not illegal to travel to countries such as Syria and Iraq, if your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK. 'Where there is a creditable likelihood of any British national travelling to high-risk area including Syria and Iraq, we will try to work with that person to ensure that they are fully aware of the risks, including highlighting the threat of kidnapping, and the effect of their travelling to fight could have on friends and family back in the UK. 'Our security advice is always in line with guidance given out by the Home Office in relation to foreign travel advice to high-risk areas.' Sir Edward Garnier QC, the former Solicitor General, warned last year that Britons who fight against terrorists in the Middle East would be interviewed by the police on their return. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are in a terrible grey area, not least because we don’t know enough about what they are doing. 'The United Kingdom is trying to defeat Isil. But freelancers are not acting on behalf of the United Kingdom. They may well be guilty of murder, or other sorts of crimes, or they might not be guilty of anything. 'It goes to the general story who go abroad to fight in other people’s wars place themselves not only in physical danger, but in that legal limbo land where they could, if they get on the wrong side of this almost invisible line, into trouble when they get home.'","Steven Christopher Costa is set to leave Britain to fight against ISIS in Iraq .

2375,"Richard Williams arriving at Manchester Crown Court ahead of his sentencing earlier today . The self-styled U-boat captain who funded his eccentric and lavish lifestyle with a 'sophisticated' £1million VAT scam was today jailed for more than four years. Fraudster Richard Williams, 54, had spent £50,000 of the cash turning a canal narrowboat into a replica German Second World War submarine with torpedo tubes and a periscope. The Captain Birdseye lookalike was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for a total of four years and eight months after admitting cheating the taxman out of over £1million by reclaiming VAT from three false businesses. His ex-wife Laurel Howarth, 28, was jailed for 20 months for her part in the five-year scam which defrauded Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of £1,017,505. Judge Michael Murray told Williams: 'This was serious offending. It was carefully thought out, organised and planned over a long period of time. All the indications are that the money was squandered. 'You created three false business and there was no substance to them whatsoever. You submitted false invoice to HMRC with a view to dishonestly reclaiming VAT.' The judge told Howarth that her involvement was 'less culpable' after she had admitted three charges of recklessly filing false VAT returns to HMRC. He said: 'I am satisfied that you might have been coerced into committing some, if not all, of the offences. But you have pleaded guilty and have had the benefit of the payments over several years.' The hearing was yesterday told by Dominic Thomas, defending Williams, that Williams had blown the cash on 'a dissipated and nomadic lifestyle - travelling around marinas, buying boats, drinking champagne and generally behaving stupidly and recklessly'. A previous hearing had been told that  Williams had indulged his passion for boats by building the replica sub on which he had posed in a captain's uniform. He had also paid for a private jet to take him and his wife  to Paris to buy bespoke wallpaper and had converted the lounge of their home in Blackpool, Lancashire into a copy of the Oval Office in the White House. The scam was thwarted by VAT inspectors who raided his 'submarine' when it was moored outside the Royal Armouries in Leeds. Six months earlier he had been spotted on a canal in Liverpool dressed as a German submarine commander. All aboard: Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams on the narrowboat he spent £50,000 on to convert into a German submarine. The 54-year-old, real name Steven Howarth, blew proceeds of a £1million VAT fraud . An unusual sight: Williams became notorious on the canal system around Yorkshire and Lancashire after  kitting out his replica German U-boat with torpedo tubes and periscope, and posing in a captain’s uniform . Prosecutor Richard Orme said Williams and his partner Howarth submitted invoices reclaiming VAT on specialist disability beds in the five-year fraud between 2005 and 2010. He had set up three companies called Sleepability, Ortho-matic and Discount Mobility Store and submitted false invoices to claim back VAT from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. He was paid £343,549 for Sleepability claims, £416,700 for Ortho-matic claims and £257,255 for Discount Mobility Store claims. The total amount came to £1,017,505. Mr Orme told Judge Michael Murray: 'He set up businesses purporting to sell beds to the disabled, such sales being zero rated for VAT, whereas in fact no sales took place. In court: Alongside Williams (right) in the dock yesterday was his former teenage bride, Lauren Howarth (left). Both were jailed today, Williams for more than four years and Howarth for 20 months . 'There were no purchases and no sales and the only business Richard Williams was involved in was the manufacturing of false invoices and careful managing of the credits and debits to and from banks accounts to give an air of legitimacy to the fraud and avoid the scrutiny of VAT inspectors.' Mr Orme said Williams had used the identity of Richard Williams from a fellow boating enthusiast and had used his date of birth and National Insurance number to change his name by deed to Captain Richard Williams from his original name of Steven Howarth. Speaking ahead of an earlier hearing, Williams said: ‘In five years we never sold one bed. We made a fortune but got caught, and I will take the punishment. We went all over the world like a couple who had won the National Lottery. We had a great time – now I’ll do the time.’","Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams spent £50,000 on his U-boat .

5034,"Eight years after their son was brutally murdered by the man he loved, Sue and Charlie MacDonald are still wondering what they could have done differently to prevent his death. The couple raised Gareth and his three brothers in the tiny isolated welsh village of Rhewl-Mostyn and now regret that they didn't teach him to be more 'streetwise.' 'Gareth wasn't street wise, he was too trusting and as a parent, that's where you think maybe I've failed him,' Sue reveals on the latest episode of TV show Britain's Darkest Taboos. Scroll down for video . Charlie MacDonald is still grieving for the son he lost eight years ago at the hands of his conman lover . Gareth met Glen Rycroft, 37, of Salford, Manchester, in a gay online chat room and they started a dating in 2005. Over the course of their relationship, Rycroft conned Gareth out of thousands of pounds and when his lover finally got wind of his theft and deceit and threatened to go to the police, he murdered him. Gareth was only 30 when he was killed in 2007. Rycroft had lured him to a Travelodge at Heston services on the M4 near Heathrow airport on September 15, 2007, where he fatally hit him over the head with a fire extinguisher. When Gareth's body was discovered, Rycroft claimed he had not been with Gareth that evening and said a rent boy was to blame. But police were able to gather enough evidence to prove Rycroft was involved - including internet searches on his computer on the best way to kill a man by striking him on the head. Gareth, pictured, was killed at the age of 30 after he discovered his boyfriend was conning him and his family out of money . Rycroft was found guilty of murder in 2009 and sentenced to life in prison, serving a minimum of 25 years. Eight years later, Sue and Charlie and still dealing with their grief and are still blaming themselves for failing to see Rycroft's true colours before it was too late. Sue said he seemed like a 'caring man' when Gareth first brought him home to meet them. 'He just came over as a caring person and nothing was too much trouble. He was a charmer,' she said. Gareth and his parents weren't the first to have been taken in by Rycroft. When he met Gareth, he was actually on probation having been released from prison for committing fraud. In his twenties, he had scammed friends and family out of thousands of pounds by pretending to have cancer and organising fundraising events where the money for 'charity' went straight into his pocket. He worked as an air steward for British Airways and also conned strangers and colleagues by telling them he could make them money through an investment opportunity he had been given by the company. Through his fictitious investment opportunity and cancer con he made thousands of pounds which he used to fund a lavish lifestyle, going on exotic holidays and driving expensive sports cars. Such was his love of the high life and charming manner - which hid his true deceitful personality - he was dubbed 'the real Talented Mr Ripley' when he appeared in court after the character made famous by Matt Damon. Debbie Henley, a former colleague of Rycroft explains: 'Glen had forged a letter head from British Airways, saying that British Airways were offering employees and friends and family the opportunity to invest in British Airways, whatever they invested they would get three times back within six months. 'Glen went around the local community offering this investment, to whoever he could. They didn't have a lot of money themselves they were vulnerable. 'He was going on holiday in Barbados and running around in soft top cars, he lived the high life with other people's money.' It was Debbie who eventually suspected Rycroft's investment opportunity was not all it seemed after she became embroiled in his cancer con. She and other friends believed he was dying of the disease as he had been shaving his own head and cracking blood capsules in his ears to make it appear he was having seizures. When Debbie realised Rycroft wasn't a cancer victim and was conning his friends into donating money, she reported him to the police. This lead to his four year imprisonment for the cancer and British Airways investment scams. A friend who fell victim to Rycroft at this time said: 'The effects of Glen’s callous acts will impact on us for a long time to come. Glen Rycroft was jailed for life for murdering Gareth by striking him round the head with a fire extinguisher . She continued: 'Glen systematically targeted friends and family who were more than willing to help and support a friend in need. For our loyalty and trust, we were rewarded with betrayal and a lot of heartache.' But these victims were luckier than Gareth, who paid with his life after being conned by Rycroft. While the conman was committing his crimes in Salford, back in Wales, Gareth had started a relationship with a woman and had two daughters. However, he struggled with his sexuality and the couple separated when Gareth realised he was gay. He started seeking a relationship with a man at the same time Rycroft was released from prison and they began their relationship with Gareth oblivious of his lover's criminal past. Rycroft began to con Gareth out of money and convinced Sue and Charlie to also give him money. Charlie said he promised them a 'holiday of a lifetime' and they gave him hundreds of pounds towards a deposit as they had no reason to suspect their son's boyfriend wasn't honest. 'He told me he was with the airline business and he was quite wealthy,' Charlie said. The couple were told he said he could get a luxury holiday on the cheap through his connections and discounts but they'd have to pay a deposit. During the course of his relationship with his son, they paid Rycroft thousands and Charlie admits that after a while he began to think 'this fella has taken us for a ride.' It was a conclusion Gareth also eventually came to and when he confronted his lover and threatened to go to the police, he was murdered. Sue said they were stunned when they were told their son's body had been discovered with fatal head wounds. 'You feel as though it’s not happening, that it’s in a book or a film or something and somebody is going to come along and say, you know it's not real. And you think like that for a long time, that it’s not real,' she said. Now Rycroft has been brought to justice and jailed, the parents are trying to move on and keep their son's memory alive for their grandchildren. Charlie said: 'It doesn't get any easier, you just learn to cope differently with it. Gareth would say life's for living and that's what he did - he lived life to the full, he enjoyed life, he loved people.'

7566,"Ryan Bertrand believes he deserves to be higher up the England pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager Roy Hodgson. The 25-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Southampton, where the left-back moved permanently earlier in the year having impressed on loan from Chelsea. Bertrand has attracted plenty of plaudits for his displays at St Mary's, yet struggled to gain the international recognition many of his colleagues have received. Ryan Bertrand was the fifth left back to be called in to Roy Hodgson's England squad last month . A call-up had been predicted for England's internationals against Lithuania and Italy last month, yet Hodgson plumped for Leighton Baines, Kieran Gibbs and Luke Shaw. Danny Rose was then preferred when Shaw pulled out, only for Bertrand to get the nod once the Tottenham full-back and then Baines dropped out. It meant the Saints left-back travelled to Italy and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1-1 draw in Turin, with his third England cap a peculiar end to the international break. 'It was different,' he said, smiling. 'The international break changed from one extreme to the next, but it was good to get back in the frame and get back in the door. 'It was good to get on the pitch, even though it was very brief. 'When you actually sit there, it hits you that all them years you spent as a kid watching football games, the England games were always the biggest. Bertrand slides in to challenge Everton midfielder James McCarthy earlier this month . 'To finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything, knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic.' England are, in fairness, blessed with strength impressive depth at left-back, with West Ham's Aaron Cresswell another arguably worthy of a call-up. Bertrand appreciates that breadth of options, but hopes to prove to Hodgson that he deserves to be further up the pecking order. 'You know, it's down to (the manager),' he said. 'Whoever he wants to pick, it is his decision. 'I'll just concentrate on my game. I'm confident enough to know that I should be in there, but I don't pick the team so I'll just keep playing.' Bertrand was one of three Southampton players in action that night in Turin, with Nathaniel Clyne starting at right-back for England and Graziano Pelle leading the line for Italy. Bertrand made his move to Southampton from Chelsea permanent in January after impressing on loan . The 29-year-old striker showed no ill-effects of the scoring drought at club level, glancing the Azzurri ahead at the Juventus Stadium - a goal the striker followed up with a first Premier League strike since December 20 in Saturday's 2-0 defeat of Hull. 'I was just thinking it is typical - anyone, anyone but him,' Bertrand said, laughing. 'It was good for him to get a goal. 'The fans have been very supportive, I think. Every week, even when we're warming up, you can hear them cheering him on.

6996,"It was the most heartbreaking tragedy of the floods that wreaked havoc around Britain last year. Little Zane Gbangbola died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site. Instead, they insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death. But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the damning evidence that proves the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home as it was engulfed by floodwater. Scroll down for video . Little Zane Gbangbola (pictured) died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas which authorities claimed was from a faulty pump at his house . But damning new evidence proves the authorities knew for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home (pictured) as it was engulfed by floodwater . The leaked official records reveal for the first time: . Last night, claims of a cover-up over Zane's death by police, the Environment Agency, Public Health England and local authorities intensified when the documents uncovered by the MoS also revealed no traces of carbon monoxide had been detected at the home in Chertsey, Surrey. The witness statements, marked restricted and confidential, were provided to police by senior fire officers the day after they attended the scene of the tragedy on February 8 last year. But Zane's grieving parents Kye and Nicole Gbangbola have faced a 'wall of silence', leading to claims of a cover-up while public agencies repeatedly insisted the boy died from carbon monoxide poisoning and that there was no risk to the wider public. Local residents accused the authorities of lying and putting lives at risk. The Gbangbolas' neighbour, Paul Marsden, 53, said last night: 'It is a disgrace that the authorities have not warned people about the dangers lurking in this land near our homes. Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from a nearby landfill site (pictured) 'They are hoping it will go away – but it won't. It should not have taken the loss of a young life for this to come to light. Continuing to lie to people about what is there is putting other lives at risk. 'We have said all along that they found hydrogen cyanide at Kye and Nicole's house and here is the proof.' Just hours after the tragedy, despite the fact that police were in constant communication with fire chiefs, Surrey Police Chief Superintendent Dave Miller declared that landfill gases were 'not one of our lines of inquiry' into Zane's death. The force spent the next 11 months investigating carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause, before dropping its case in January on advice from the Crown Prosecution Service that there was no case to answer in relation to a hired petrol-powered pump in the family's home which they insist was never switched on. Nicole and Kye Gbangbola also needed hospital treatment because of hydrogen cyanide exposure on the night of their son's death. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site . Kye, 48, has been permanently paralysed from the waist down because of the gas, which was used to murder millions in the Nazi death camps. The couple have struggled for answers from the police, Environment Agency, Public Health England and councils ever since – and are still waiting for a coroner's inquest to be held because of the delays caused by the long-running police investigation. The Mail on Sunday has led the way in covering the tragic case – but has been stonewalled at every turn. Now this newspaper has seen leaked statements from police interviews with senior firefighters who were among the first of dozens of emergency personnel on the scene when Zane was rushed to hospital. The highly experienced officers serve with Surrey Fire and Rescue Service's Detection Identification and Monitoring team, which is called in to investigate gases. A commanding officer's statement to police says: 'As we were about to leave the premises, one of the gas detectors went into an amber alarm indicating hydrogen cyanide had been detected at levels of ten parts per million. We left immediately.' The officer says the level of gas in the house is considered dangerous if inhaled for more than 15 minutes. An immediately fatal concentration is 50 parts per million. Fire crews fled the riverside home in Chertsey, Surrey (pictured) for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide . The reading was taken at 7.29am – four hours after Zane's mother found him unconscious in a bedroom above the hallway and rang 999. After Zane was found, emergency services had opened doors and windows to ventilate the property for several hours. The firefighters double-checked their equipment and re-entered the house on two more occasions to confirm that hydrogen cyanide was in the property at 'concentrated levels', according to their incident log. It records the gas being detected at 7.47am and 8.19am. Neighbour Mr Marsden recalled seeing the firefighters 'ducking in and out of the house in breathing apparatus.' He said: 'The fire chief said to me there was hydrogen cyanide. I asked if it was ground gases and he said that was right and everyone will have to go to hospital.' Another statement seen by this newspaper says the gas detectors used by the fire service had been tested and certified as working correctly four days before Zane's death. The Gbangbolas said last night that they could not comment on the fire service documents for legal reasons ahead of Zane's inquest, due to be held later this year. A close family friend said: 'The truth is out – they have been gassed. Kye and Nicole are very angry.' Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from the landfill site. He added: 'If this was an old unregulated tip, it could well be that cyanides were dumped many years ago. If there is acid spilt at the site, and then the water came out due to the flooding, then that would bring acid to the cyanide and release hydrogen cyanide.' This newspaper asked Surrey Police why the force had not disclosed that it knew hydrogen cyanide had been detected in the family's home hours after Zane had died. We also asked why the force spent 11 months investigating the carbon monoxide theory. A spokesman did not answer those questions but said in a statement: 'In February 2014, the post mortem examination into Zane's death proved inconclusive. 'Further thorough and extensive tests were completed. The pathologist gave a result of carbon monoxide intoxication.' The police, Environment Agency, Public Health England, Surrey Fire Service, Surrey County Council and Spelthorne Borough Council all said they could not comment in detail ahead of the coroner's inquest. A spokeswoman for Spelthorne council said: 'We are aware it is the family's belief that there is a link between the landfill close to their home and the tragic death of their son. 'However, based on current information, we do not believe there is any evidence of a causal link.'","Zane Gbangbola died at home in the middle of the night after gas poisoning .

","A new evidence has emerged revealing the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas could have caused the death of seven-year-old Zane Gbangbola during the UK floods last year, instead of the previous attribution to carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family. Documents show that the gas, which is capable of killing a person in seconds, was detected by senior Surrey fire officers the day after the tragedy, at levels that could prove deadly within 15 minutes by Surrey Fire Service’s Detection Identification and Monitoring Team. Zane's parents have accused the authorities of a cover-up and called for an inquest into their son's death, which is set to be held later this year.

1690,"A male student accused of raping his classmate has sued Columbia University for failing to protect him against backlash and harassment. Authorities rejected Emma Sulkowicz's case that Paul Nungesser, a German citizen, was a 'serial rapist' who assaulted her after class. Nonetheless, the case gathered international attention as Sulkowicz, a senior majoring in visual arts, publicly paraded her mattress in protest, calling for his indictment. And according to Nungesser's lawsuit citing 'gender-based harassment and defamation', Columbia presented the allegations as fact on a university-owned website. Scroll down for video . 'No protection': Paul Nungesser is suing Columbia University for allowing Emma Sulkowicz to parade the school and take campus-provided transport with her mattress in protest against him, calling him a rapist . The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, three days after a judge tossed out another gender-based lawsuit brought by a male student against Columbia University. Defendants include the school, its board of trustees, President Lee C. Bollinger and Professor Jon Kessler. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages. 'Columbia University's effective sponsorship of the gender-based harassment and defamation of Paul resulted in an intimidating, hostile, demeaning ... learning and living environment,' the lawsuit said. Roger Hornsby, a Columbia spokesman, said the school had no comment. Email messages requesting comment from Bollinger and Kessler were not immediately returned. In his lawsuit, Nungesser said a Columbia-owned website had presented as fact that he sexually assaulted Sulkowicz, a senior majoring in visual arts. It said that the school allowed Sulkowicz to carry a mattress into classes, the library and campus-provided transportation as part of her senior thesis, that Kessler approved the 'Mattress Project' for her course credit and that Sulkowicz's pledge to carry her mattress to graduation may prevent Nungesser and his parents, who'd like to fly from Germany, from participating in graduation ceremonies. 'Day-to-day life is unbearably stressful, as Emma and her mattress parade around campus each and every day,' the suit said. As a result of publicity that resulted in media reports in 35 countries, the lawsuit said, Nungesser 'has been subjected to severe, pervasive ... and threatening behavior by other Columbia students, believing that Paul is a `serial rapist,' whenever Paul has appeared at university activities.' Nungesser became the target of international attacks following the claims, which were dismissed by a judge . The complaint also said he wants to stay in the United States, where he has been dating a girlfriend for over a year, and is seeking consulting work in New York, though job prospects have been 'severely jeopardized' by the school's support of Sulkowicz. In an email responding to a request for comment, Sulkowicz wrote: 'I think it's ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece. 'It's ridiculous that he would read it as a `bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia. If artists are not allowed to make art that reflect on our experiences, then how are we to heal?' Sulkowicz has argued her case was badly mishandled by the school disciplinary panel after she reported in 2013 she was raped in her dorm months before. She was among 23 students who sued Columbia last year, saying it mishandled sexual assault cases. She also attended President Barack Obama's State of the Union address in January at the invitation of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.","Paul Nungesser was accused of raping former friend Emma Sulkowicz .

An analogue promotional watch from Apple with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage. For the same price as the 1997 timepiece, Apple fans could pre-order five of the cheapest Apple Watch Sport, which cost £299 in the UK and still have some change. An analogue promotional watch from Apple (pictured) with a blue bezel, rubber strap and colourful hands, is listed on the internet auction site with a ‘buy it now’ price of $2,499.99 (£1,707.47) plus postage . However, it is still cheaper than the Apple Watch Edition, which costs upwards of £8,000 ($10,000). The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was made by Quartz and released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item’. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote on their eBay page. ‘A new battery has been installed and the watch is new, never used or worn.’ It is still in its original box and the seller claims to have two to offload, with 10 days to go. The seller, called ‘theappleipodbay’ calls the watch, which was released to promote Apple’s Mac Operating system, a ‘rare collector item. This image shows the listing on the auction website . Unlike Apple’s new Watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. Three versions of Apple's watch (pictured) are available to pre-order online and almost one million orders are thought to have been taken in the US on the first day alone . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Unlike Apple’s new smart watch, the vintage model has a circular screen, which has no digital capabilities and shows the company’s old rainbow hue logo. The International Business Times reported that the watch is almost 50 times more valuable – according to its seller – than it was a year ago, thanks to the launch of the new Apple Watch. It’s not known how many of the vintage watches Apple had made at the time, or how many still exist, but one sold on eBay in Match last year for $54 (£37). At the time of writing, two more of the watch model are listed online for $1,000 (£679) and $750 (£510), but neither have fetched that amount of money, suggesting sellers may just be trying their luck. It's thought that Apple sold almost one million Apple Watches in the US alone on the first day that the device could be pre-ordered. It goes on sale in shops in nine countries on April 24. Apple has not confirmed any sales figures, but Tim Cook, interviewed on cable television channel CNBC, said initial orders were 'great.' Slice Intelligence measured digital commerce by tracking consumer receipts to come up with its number of 957,000 American shoppers ordering Apple Watches on the first day that they could do so. Those ordering an Apple Watch Sport, the cheapest version, spent $382.83 per watch and those ordering the Apple Watch spent $707.04. 'As expected, most consumers – 62 percent – purchased the less-expensive Sport model,' said Jaimee Minney of Slice. The data also showed that most consumers opted for the larger 42 mm case. Apple predicted on Thursday that demand would exceed supply at product launch. Soon after online pre-orders opened on Friday, Apple's website listed shipping times in June for some models of the watch and four to six weeks for others. There was immediately brisk bidding on eBay for confirmed orders for watches, with hundreds of sellers looking to make a few hundred or even thousand dollars by passing on their watches, once received. ‘The watch was part of an Apple promo and has been preserved from the 1990s,' the seller wrote.

489,"Seoul (CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is continuing to rule with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year, according to an assessment by South Korean intelligence agents, a lawmaker who attended a closed briefing said. Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions. The nature of the intelligence supporting the National Intelligence Service allegations was also not immediately clear. North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. According to Shin, intelligence officials say Kim is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views at variance with his own. He considers those a challenge to his authority, the intelligence officials said, according to Shin. For example, a senior official with Ministry of Forestry was executed for expressing dissatisfaction with the country's forestry program, the lawmaker said. North Korean defectors share their ordeals . The vice chairman of the State Planning Commission was executed because he objected to changing the design of a science and technology hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower, the intelligence officials said, according to the lawmaker. And in March, according to the South Korean lawmaker, Kim executed on charges of espionage four members of the Unhasu Orchestra, including the general director, because of a scandal, Shin said. Kim became North Korea's Supreme Commander in December 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. According to the National Intelligence Service, he is reported to have executed 17 senior officials in 2012, 10 in 2013 and 41 in 2014.

8394,"Beef at a good price . If Ian Botham is going to watch his Test wickets record get beaten by Jimmy Anderson, he might as well earn himself a bit of cash doing it. After spotting that SkyBet were offering 9/4 on the Lancashire seamer to take four wickets in the first innings on Wednesday morning, Beefy, who remains England’s leading wicket-taker for the time being with 383, tweeted: ‘I’ll have a go at that price!!!’ Sir Ian Botham was tempted to bet on Jimmy Anderson breaking his record on the third morning in Antigua . Daddy’s girl . With Botham’s record in his sights, all eyes at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium were on Anderson — including those of his wife Daniella and daughter Ruby Luxe.

By far the most interesting on-pitch battle was between Ben Stokes and Jermaine Blackwood. The West Indies’ sixth man in scored 112 in the first innings, much to the frustration of Stokes — and not just because of the eight boundaries the Jamaican hit off him. After Tuesday’s no-ball episode, Stokes narrowly missed out on Blackwood’s wicket twice on Wednesday  — seeing an edge dropped by James Tredwell at slip, followed by a close lbw denial upheld by the third umpire. Jermaine Blackwood hit his maiden Test match century in his sixth match for the West Indies on Wednesday . Ben Stokes was frustrated twice when he thought he dismissed Blackwood, adding to Tuesday's no-ball . Five-star Jos .

3282,"Photographer Seth Casteel's unique pictures of dogs swimming underwater managed to captivate an international audience, but now he has a new subject: babies. Casteel has found a remarkable new way to capture images of toddlers at their most playful and pure as they dive down into the deep during their first swimming lesson. The pictures for his new book, Underwater Babies, reveal adorable babies as they explore the underwater world, chubby-cheeked, curious, mischievous, and playful, all captured in his up-close-and-personal signature style. Scroll down for video . Super swimmer: Zoe Ubiera is five-months old and was one of 750 babies that Seth Casteel photographed .

Oceanic: Nine-month-old Khyleigh takes like a duck to water as she swims towards the camera . His pictures are innovative and take on an air of excitement as the youngsters swim beneath the waves. Casteel says he was drawn to create his new book, Underwater Babies after hearing of the shocking statistics of the numbers of children that drown. Kids between one and four have the highest rates of drowning than any group in the nation. 'The book is a celebration of babies, but there's definitely a serious element to it,' Casteel told Today.com. 'A big reason I wanted to make this book is to promote the cause of water safety for babies. I just want to let people know about the benefits of these classes and that they are something to strongly consider.' He created the book by heading along to water safety classes for babies at swimming pools in ten different states. He photographed around 750 babies in schools across each of the states to create Underwater Babies, which will be released on April 7. Acquatic: Michael, 12 months, explores underwater with his goggles on . Playful: Valentina, nine months, takes a dip underwater with her rattle .

Serene: Casteel hopes to use the adorable photos of babies like 4 1/2 month old Michael to promote water safety for toddlers . 'I only had a limited window to really seize that moment in time because they can only go underwater just for a moment,' Casteel said. 'I could only take four or five pictures really quickly. Maybe the baby turned or there were bubbles or the instructor got in the way. I was never frustrated because that's the nature of it. You get what you get.' Apart from promoting his new 70-page book containing his creative pictures, Casteel said that he was eager to get the message across about water safety. He was spurred along after hearing a story about an 18-month old baby who drowned in a pool at a family reunion where over 40 people were present, yet the baby died after being left unattended. Floater: This 11-month-old named Warren is happy in the few moments he has beneath the pool's surface . Snapshot: Casteel often only had a second or two to capture the images of babies like Emerson who is 7 months old when they briefly went underwater . The babies in the pictures are being taught to 'self-rescue,' in which babies are taught to hold their breath underwater, kick their feet, turn over to float on their backs and rest until help arrives. The technique was pioneered in the late '60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor's child. His methods have spread around the world and are now taught in numerous clinics and imitated widely. Underwater Babies by Seth Casteel is published by Headline on 7th April at £11.99.

3989,"The former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes  is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers accusing them of unsanitary conditions that led to a MRSA infection  that he says ended his career. The 36-year-old is seeking $20million in lost future earnings and $15,000 in damages after he contracted the deadly infection in 2013 following a surgery on an ingrown toenail, according to  Albert Breer of the NFL Network. The lawsuit was announced on Monday and alleges that the Buccaneers 'failed to disclose and actively concealed ongoing incidents of the infection among other individuals' who used  team's facilities, according to ESPN. Lawrence Tynes has filed a lawsuit against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $20million in lost future earnings . Tynes was in training camp with the Buccaneers in 2013 when he contracted the deadly MRSA infection . The suit also claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean, according to ESPN. Tynes and another player, offensive guard Carl Nicks, both contracted Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during a July 2013 outbreak of the  infection during the Buccaneers' summer training camp prior to the season. Nicks reached a settlement with the team last year over his infection for $3million, according to Deadspin. Tynes, who has not kicked a football since 2012, said that he spent eight or nine days without being diagnosed and his infection worsened. 'No one cultured my toe at the facility,' he told ESPN. 'I left that facility on my own and found a doctor in town and said, 'Can you look at my toe because I think all the doctors at the Bucs are lying to me.' The former kicker is seeking an additional $15,000 in damages and says the infection has ended his career . The lawsuit claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean . 'And I took my sock off, he looks at my toe, without any scientific study or anything, he said, 'You have MRSA.' And I'm at a billion-dollar company with the supposed best doctors in the world, and not one of them told me that I had that? I know they knew I had it. They just didn't want me to have it.' He also told ESPN he nearly had his toe amputated due to MRSA, and said that because of the pain in his toe he can longer play. After he contracted the infection, Tynes was  placed on the non-football injury list (NFI) by the team just before the season began. MRSA is usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities. It is resistant to most antibiotic treatments and can lead to deadly flesh-eating bacteria. The infection can remain in the body for years while being treated. The superbug killed more people than AIDS in 2011. Source: Centers for Disease Control . The NFI list is the team's way of denying . liability after he contracted the precursor for flesh-eating bacteria, . which denies him of certain benefits he is eligible for while on IR. Players on IR reserve their full salary, an accrued season (towards both free agency and retirement benefits) and full health insurance – players on NFI receive none of those benefits. First infected after a July 30 procedure to remove an ingrown toenail on his kicking foot, in earlier reports Tynes said he went to the team after his foot became red and swollen within a few days. Six different antibiotics and three surgical procedures later, he previously told Fox Sports that the team was denying liability. 'I'm standing up for what I think is right,' Tynes told ESPN. 'Or what I know is right. I'm in this thing 'til the very end. I'm not going away.' The former New York Giants postseason hero had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line hooked directly to his veins to more efficiently get antibiotics into his system to fight the infection, according to Fox Sports. The kicker's plight was first brought to the nation's attention by his wife after Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano told media the infected players were 'responding well' to treatment. 'I hear my husband is responding 'well' to treatment. LOL! He's NOT responding at all yet. This is our #bucslife,' Amanda Tynes tweeted August 13, 2013 with a picture of her ailing husband on the couch, hooked up to an intravenous drip. Less than a month later, with their kicker still sidelined and hopes of him recovering in time to contribute to the 2013 season dwindling, the Buccaneers informed the two-time Super Bowl champion the weekend before the season opener that he would be placed on the non-football injury list, further infuriating him and his wife. Tynes (9) twice kicked the New York Giants to the Super Bowl with NFC Championship-winning overtime field goals . 'The Bucs informed my husband via EMAIL that he will be placed on NFI. Wouldn't expect anything more from such a classy organization,' Amanda Tynes tweeted at the time. 'Historically, other teams have done the right thing,' said Lawrence Tynes. 'Other players who have had staph or MRSA, the appropriate designation is IR.' MRSA infections are resistant to most bacteria and, if untreated, can turn deadly. They are usually diagnosed in people who have been in hospitals or had medical procedures and can take years to overcome, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Tynes took to the airwaves to voice his concerns and speak out against what he felt was negligent treatment by the team. He signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers prior to the 2013 season after a six-year stint with the Giants, where he became famous for twice nailing field goals in overtime that sent his team to the Super Bowl. Tynes started his career with the Kansas City Chiefs.","Lawrence Tynes contracted the deadly infection after surgery on his foot in 2013 and is now seeking an additional $15,000 in damages .

Although the lavish feast was in fact a set (created by food stylist Iain Graham), the cat fancier admitted that her British shorthair, Kimchi, has such a discerning palate he loves crunchy 'human food'  and that taramasalata would be his 'death row dish'. Draped in peach silk and surrounded by cat delicacies, TV chef Gizzi Erskine appears with her pet Kimchi in cat magazine, Puss Puss .

Adding that Kimchi, 'loves human food and will steal it off our plate if we’re not looking. 'She loves anything crunchy, so if there are poppadoms or tortilla chips around that’s it.

Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he’s Scottish, but it didn’t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says. 'Kimchi is called Kimchi because of my love of Korean food,' she adds. The new addition to the Erskine feline family is also a food lover - and has even more unusual tastes.

3834,"A morbidly obese man who piled on the pounds thanks to a twice-daily takeaway habit and 'hated leaving the house' because of his looks has lost 19st in just one year. David Rush, 33, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, felt that he 'shouldn't go out' because of his size but lost the weight after plucking up the courage to start cycling. At his heaviest, he weighed 34st and was forced to order specialist XXXXXL clothes on the internet - the result of topping up his takeaway-heavy diet with six bags of crisps and two bottles of full-fat Coca-Cola a day.

'I hated leaving the house and going out anywhere because I didn't know if the places I would be going to were tight for space,' he explains. 'I was that big it made me feel like I shouldn't be out. My eating was awful - I would have takeaways every night for my dinner and eat junk all through the day.' But when his weight began to prevent him from walking easily, he decided to take action and ditched the takeaways in favour of a healthy meal plan.

'Since my weight loss my life has changed so much,' he enthuses. 'I started off with walking but once I started to cycle the weight just came off and I was able to join the gym. 'I've got my social life back, I'm out with my friends and I've got myself a new small car I can fit into.'

However, you may be able to wave goodbye tp sleepless nights thanks to one father who has come up with a trick that can get your little one to sleep in less than one minute. Nathan Dailo, from Sydney, uploaded a video to his YouTube channel demonstrating how he gets his three-month-old son Seth to drift off in just 42 seconds. The clip that has now received almost 26,000 views sees the father gliding a piece of white tissue paper over his son's face repeatedly until he nods off. Nathan uploaded the video, writing: 'I'm sure every parent tries new things to put their little one to sleep. 'Watch as my wife and I put our 3 month old baby boy, Seth, to sleep in under a minute using nothing but a piece of tissue paper.' At the beginning of the video little Seth seems anything other than sleepy as he fidgets and whines in his cot. A father from Sydney has worked out a way of making his baby fall asleep in 42 seconds . In his YouTube video, Nathan Dailo shows that by running tissue paper over his son Seth makes him sleep . Then Nathan slowly begins stroking Seth's face gently with the piece of white tissue paper. The first few strokes of tissue paper seems to have little effect on baby Seth who appears to be wide awake, however after the fifth stroke Seth's eyes begin droop. He slowly begins to drift off, opening his eyes occasionally but but by the 14th stroke he has drifted off entirely, and all in just 42 seconds. And it appears that Nathan is not the only one it has worked for. One grateful viewer of the video commented: 'This worked for my baby 5 times already so thanks!' Got a better method?

7873,"Chelsea captain John Terry hailed Eden Hazard as one of the world's best players after the Belgian inspired the Blues to a 2-1 win over Stoke. Hazard tucked home a penalty to put Chelsea in front before Charlie Adam scored a memorable 66-yard equaliser for the visitors. But Loic Remy was on hand to turn home Hazard's square pass to wrap up the three points and take Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea captain John Terry hailed Eden Hazard as one of the world's best players following the Stoke win . The Belgian international gave Chelsea the lead from the spot and made no mistake against Asmir Begovic . Hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard-fought win over Stoke City in west London . And, in a game where Diego Costa lasted just 10 minutes having been introduced from the bench before being forced off with a hamstring injury, Hazard was the man to make the difference with Terry quick to praise him. 'He was excellent,' Terry told Sky Sports 1. 'He has been our best player by a long way this year and in those games when you are looking for a bit of extra, a bit of magic from someone he is the one who steps up and managed to create something. He is up there with the (Lionel) Messi's and (Cristiano) Ronaldo's and can still get better and better.' With just eight games remaining Chelsea are hot favourites to take the title but Terry is urging caution to those who believe their name is already on the trophy. Diego Costa looks set to miss at least two weeks after suffering a hamstring injury during the match . Costa had only been on the field just over ten minutes before he pulled up with the muscle injury . Jose Mourinho expects the striker to be out for at least two Premier League games following the injury . 'It was a tough game, we knew it was going to be difficult,' he added. 'They made it difficult last year. First half they were very tight and they are a very well organised team, it was tough but we ground it out. 'It is the old cliche but it is ticking a box then moving on. 'We have a massive game away at QPR, a big London derby for us. We just need to keep putting three points on the board. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is left on his back after Charlie Adam's spectacular wonder goal . 'The goal from Charlie Adam was a great goal and it stunned us just before half-time. 'But we came out in the second half knowing what we had to do, and I think before the international break it was important to get the win and the same again today just to get the momentum.

2152,"Fergal O'Brien is daring to dream what might be at Aintree on Saturday as he insists last year's fourth Alvarado is going into the race in better shape this time around. The 10-year-old gelding has run only once this season, finishing fifth at Doncaster in February. But Limerick-born O'Brien, 42, believes that is preferable a preferable situation to 12 months ago when Alvarado went into the race not having run since pulling up at Cheltenham on New Year's Day. Fergal O'Brien says that Alvarado is in better shape going into this weekend's Grand National at Aintree . That is showing in his contender's demeanour of Paul Moloney's at home, O'Brien said. The trainer added: 'I think we are in a better position. He is very straightforward in that if he is eating well and you can get him in the field he is pretty well in himself. 'I actually think we are a bit further on than we were last year.' O'Brien spent 18 years working for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies, 16 of them as Head Lad. During that time, he helped prepare two National winners in Earth Summit and Bindaree but, with duties back at base, last year was the first time he had ever been at Aintree on National day. Alvarado, pictured here at Cheltenham in 2013, has run only once this season back in February at Doncaster . O'Brien added: 'I said all along if Alvarado jumped the first couple of fences and enjoyed it he would run well. He has an awful lot of ability, although you don't always get it from him. He is not ungenuine but because he is quirky.'

Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died . Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course . 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away.

3385,"The hunt for proof of the Loch Ness monster's existence may be over - and it doesn't lie in a blurry photograph. Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The  name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

5914,"A photo editor for a Baltimore newspaper says he was beaten by police at a protest over the death of Freddie Gray. J.M. Giordano, who works at the City Paper, says Baltimore police 'swarmed over' him and hit him repeatedly. A video posted to the newspaper's website Sunday shows at least two police officers in riot gear hitting and kicking Giordano as City Paper Managing Editor Baynard Woods screams, 'He's a photographer! He's press!' Scroll down for video . Injured on the job: A photojournalist was allegedly beaten by police Saturday night as he covered protests in Baltimore, Maryland . Shoved to the ground: Giordano says he was standing in front of a police line when they suddenly started marching and he couldn't get out of the way fast enough. Pictured above in a photo posted to Facebook . The 41-year-old photographer says the incident happened around 12.30am when someone threw a rock at a police line and hit an officer's shield. Giordano and a protester were standing next to each other when the police line suddenly marched forward and the two men didn't move out of the way quickly enough, each being knocked to the ground. About five or six police officers hit Giordano and the other protester with their shields, the photographer said. 'They just swarmed over me,' he said, according to City Paper. 'I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out.' 'I kept shooting it. As soon as I got up I started taking pictures.' After the incident, the protester who was standing next to Giordano was arrested - even though the photographer was sure that he wasn't responsible for throwing a projectile at police, which sparked the charge by officers. That protester was just one of nearly 35 arrested in the protests Saturday night and Sunday morning. The march turned violent later in the evening, when groups of rogue protesters started vandalizing local businesses and smashing cars. Giordano believes he was let go because police knew he was a member of the press, but says they tried to block him from continuing to photograph the event. Hitting a journalist: In the video, the City Paper managing editor can be heard yelling 'He's a photographer! He's press!' to no avail . Released: The protester who was knocked down to the ground with Giordano was arrested. Giordano believes he was left alone because police knew he was a member of the media . Blocking: However, Giordano says police continued to try to block him from photographing the protest after the incident . Minor: Giordano says he sustained minor injuries to his arm. However, he says that they will not keep him out of work . On the ground: Above, a photo Giordano took Saturday night after being pushed to the ground by police . However, Giordano says another photographer working at the protest was arrested - Sait Serkan Gurbuz with Reuters who was later released and cited for disorderly conduct. Police did not immediately comment on the incident involving Giordano or Gurbuz's arrest. Giordano says he suffered minor injuries to his arm but that they will not stop him from continuing to photograph the Gray protests. In addition to his work at City Paper, Giordano has had his photos published by i-D magazine, the Baltimore Sun, and Al-Jazeera America. Baltimore has been in a state of unrest ever since April 19, when a local man named Freddie Gray died from injuries allegedly sustained while in police custody.

The robot, called BB-8 (left) stars in the eagerly anticipated film Star Wars: The Force Awakens and took to the stage at Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California, where it literally ran rings around retro droid R2-D2 (pictured right) It’s a question that’s got Twitter talking, with a user named Jock tweeting: BB8? BBGREAT more like and Jimmy Wong in LA saying: ‘HOW DOES BB-8 WORK. It's so coooool.’ Joshua Harris, a teenager from Oxford said: ‘#BB8 is one of the few things in life that makes me want to understand engineering, while Video editor Ron Dot Org tweeted: ‘This is the part of the #StarWars event today that really blew my mind. #BB8 is not cgi. AT ALL’. BB-8’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction, but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn’t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works. Speaking about filming the movie, JJ Abrams said: 'There were a lot of discussions about how having a CGI BB-8 could be so much easier for shooting. JJ Abrams, the film’s director, confirmed that a real robot was used during filming, instead of CGI, but did not reveal how the robot worked. Here, BB-8 the rolling droid BB-8 is spotted inside the Millennium Falcon, peeking around a corner . From today, Star Wars fans will be able to tweet using new emojis exclusive to the social network. Three emojiis have been introduced showing C3PO, a Storm trooper and a new droid. They have been rolled out in anticipation of the release of Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. To tweet a Star Wars emoji, users must include hastags: #C3PO, #STORMTROOPER or #BB8 which will be transformed into little cartoons. ‘But we talked originally about it would be better for the film, for the actors, for the sets and the look of it if it were performed.’ He confirmed that BB-8 was ‘built and puppeteered’ in the film, but no strings were visible when the beeping, chirping droid rolled on stage, leading experts to speculate that it must be controlled by at least one remote control. The robot’s body is likely to be a large robotic ball, like a big version of the Sphero, Mashable’s Andrew Tarantola speculated. The toy by Orbotix is controlled by a smartphone app using a Bluetooth connection and allows users to make it go in any direction – much like the new droid. BB-8’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction (pictured) but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn’t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works . The robot’s body is likely to be a large remote-controlled robotic ball, like a big version of the Sphero (pictured). The toy by Orbotix is controlled by a smartphone app using a Bluetooth connection and allows users to make it go in any direction – much like the new droid . Professor Will Stewart, a Fellow of The Institution of Engineering and Technology in London, told MailOnline that the walking globe is easy to achieve – ‘we could build one if we had the budget’. ‘It’s related to the default egg-race-style self-propelled double wheel device or the walk-in-balloon which anyone can try,’ he said, referring to a zorb, which humans walk inside and push against the side to move along. But the real mystery is how the robot’s head can move independently but stay on top of the free-rolling ball. It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body, but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness. It could be that the droid’s head is a separate robot with its own set of remote controls, enabling it to ‘look’ around. It's currently a mystery as to how BB-8 moves, but its white and orange case may hide a larger mechanism like that found in Sphero, which allows it to move quickly in any direction. The real question is how its head stays on . BB-8’s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction, but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn’t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works. This image shows the robot on the set of the film, which will be released in the UK in December . It may be able to stay upright easily by depending on a gyroscope that tells it which way is up and use an accelerometer to monitor motion, much like many smartphone games. Magnets may still be used to keep the head in contact with the body. Professor Stewart said: ‘The floating ‘head’ is probably on rollers magnetically bound through the plastic ball to the ""driving"" robot inside.’ He explained that rare earth magnets are very strong and light and the robot’s ‘movements are consistent with this, such as a tendency to move in the direction of travel.’ ‘The inside and head could be wirelessly linked but given that this robot is radio controlled rather than autonomous…I suspect that head and body are just independently radio controlled.’ It’s possible that magnets are involved to ‘stick’ the droid’s head to its body (pictured), but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it’s head stayed on top of the body – and the stage performance seemed effortlessness . From today, Star Wars fans will be able to tweet using new emojis (pictured) exclusive to the social network . Sphero is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app. It's been suggested that BB-8 may use similar technology in its body. The Sphero toy can be programmed to weave in between objects, follow augmented reality race tracks and even keep a pet entertained. The 2.8-inch (73mm) ball travels up to 5mph (0.6 km/h), is fully waterproof and costs $99.99 in the U.S, and £99.99 in the UK. Sphero (pictured) is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app . The gadget weighs 178g (0.4lbs) and has a gyroscope and accelerometer inside that connect to a tablet or smartphone via Bluetooth, as well as two rubber wheels. A counterweight gets the ball rolling on demand and sensors allow users to control the direction and speed of the ball. The wheels inside work like a hamster running inside a ball and never leave Sphero's surface, so it can turn corners at high speed. There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games, and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics. It is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology.","BB-8 moved in all directions on stage at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim .

8760,"As Captain Ross Poldark, his brooding good looks and rippling muscles have sent women around the country into a frenzy. But Aidan Turner's Poldark co-star Heida Reed has claimed the obsession with his body is sexist, and is unintentionally undermining the BBC1 series. Miss Reed, 27, who stars in the period drama as Poldark's former lover Elizabeth, said Turner, 31, was being 'objectified' in a way that would not be tolerated if he were female. Poldark star Heida Reed has claimed audiences' obsession with Aidan Turner's (pictured body is sexist . Claiming it is evidence of reverse sexism, Miss Reed said: 'I think there should be the same standard for both sexes when it comes to things like this. 'Of course it's nice for everyone involved that he's viewed as a sex symbol or very attractive man. But it's getting a little bit ridiculous. I think it just undermines the rest of the show. 'I don't think it should be any more allowed than if a woman was in the same situation. And if she was, the media would have a field day that she's being objectified.' Reed said she knew 'for a fact that [Turner is] completely baffled by the amount of interest' in the popularity of images that show him scything in a field. 'The producers had no idea that was going to happen either,' she explained. 'They never said 'let's have his shirt taken off and everyone will go nuts'. It wasn't a strategy.' The Icelandic actress's comments follow overwhelming interest in Turner's physique from Poldark's avid fans. Hundreds of viewers have taken to Twitter to marvel at his strapping form, as scenes showed him swimming naked in the sea and scything a field topless. One joked on Twitter: 'If Poldark gets any hotter we'll have to call the fire brigade.' Another told MailOnline: 'There isn't a single woman I know, who doesn't think he's absolutely gorgeous.' And they even complained after last week's episode failed to feature Turner's bare chest. One posted: 'All bad news on the Poldark front tonight. @Aidan didn't get his shirt off once.' However while fans' interest might be taken for flattery, Miss Reed said Turner, who is reportedly engaged to his girlfriend of four years, actress Sarah Greene, is 'completely baffled' by the level of attention, which has included online marriage proposals.

2660,"The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the burning stand . His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

The release of the book coincides with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, with English football set for a minute's silence ahead of all games on April 25, which will be Bradford's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much consternation in the West Yorkshire city. 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.","Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating blaze was not an accident .

7521,"George Davon Kennedy of DeKalb, Georgia, a student at Middle Tennessee State University, was taken in Tuesday night as police believe he is one of the men caught on video assaulting a woman in Panama City . A third suspect has been arrested by police as a suspect in a brutal sexual assault that occurred on a Florida beach. George Davon Kennedy of DeKalb, Georgia, a student at Middle Tennessee State University, was taken in Tuesday night as police believe he is one of the men caught on video raping a woman in Panama City. He now joins two other men who were arrested late last week. The brief cellphone clip came to light earlier this week as deputies continued searching for two additional suspects in the March attack in Panama City Beach that was witnessed by hundreds of people who failed to intervene. Now, only one suspect remains at large. Authorities previously arrested a pair of students from Alabama's Troy University who were allegedly seen in the video, which was recorded last month. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He said the sickening footage shows at least three men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Calhoun was released on a $50,000 bond Tuesday, while Martistee remained in Bay County jail. Scroll down for videos . Impassive: The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring milling around and chatting about Instagram as a 19-year-old woman was allegedly being raped just steps away . Sheriff McKeithen said the video of the attack showed hundreds of spring break revelers impassively looking on as the unconscious teenage girl was being raped by a group of men, CBS News reported. ‘People standing, almost rubbing the incapacitated girl,’ the sheriff said. ‘Standing there, more concerned about spilling their beer than they did someone being raped. McKeithen revealed that so far, his deputies have recovered more than four recordings of the sexual assault, and he believes that are more videos out there. The sheriff’s office released a short clip showing the crowd they said was present at the time. The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring breakers goofing off and standing around talking about Instagram. At one point, a few people cheer, but it’s unclear why. It is unclear from the video released what bystanders could actually see. But Sheriff’s spokeswoman Ruth Corley said the video was released ‘to show the crowd that was surrounding the incident and to show people, not only was it a horrible event, but it was witnessed by so many people who did absolutely nothing to stop or call police.’ The alleged victim told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' the Bay County sheriff said. Officials did not release any more information about the two other men wanted in connection with the gang rape, but they said additional arrests are expected.

Last Friday's charges against college track star Martistee and his classmate Calhoun stem from a video footage that was found on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' Following their arrest, Martistee and Calhoun were suspended from Troy University. The 22-year-old student-athlete, who remained in jail Sunday, was also removed from the track and field team.","Middle Tennessee State University George Davon Kennedy was arrested and charged with sexual assault Tuesday night .

3650,"He is known for being meticulous in his preparations for major tennis tournaments. But when it comes to the biggest event in his life, Andy Murray is happy to take a back seat. The 2013 Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist has revealed he has left the vast majority of planning next week's wedding to his fiancée, Kim Sears. Scroll down for video . Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week - he is pictured as best man at brother Jamie's wedding to Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix House Hotel in 2010 . Murray was presented with a cake to mark his 500th ATP Tour victory cake in Miami this week - for his wedding he has said he was involved in the cake tasting, but has left the majority to his fiancee . Miss Sears, 27, pictured in Miami, has been been entrusted with planning the pair's wedding next week . Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral next week, and the tennis star has admitted he 'couldn't care less' about the finer details of the day saying 'I try to stay out of all that sort of stuff'. However Murray, a self-confessed foodie, will have some input for the wedding as he has chosen the menu based on a series of food tasting sessions. In an American interview, the 2012 US Open winner, said: 'I think in a lot of cases it's just better to let the woman have it how she would like. 'In terms of flowers and colour schemes and those sorts of things, I couldn't really care less about that, to be honest. 'The only thing I wanted to do was to be involved with the food. Because I like my food - I like good food. 'I went along and did the food tasting, and I also did the cake tasting as well. So that would be the thing that I would say I have been most involved in.' He added: 'The music is something we chat about together as well.' Miss Sears is in charge of colours schemes and flowers as Murray admits 'he couldn't care less about that' The 27-year-old has been a permanent fixture at the court side since she and Murray started dating in 2005 . Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005 . The couple have dated since they met in 2005 . Murray and Miss Sears, who have been together for a decade, will wed at the 1000-year old Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 12th century cathedral is much larger than the chapel in the grounds of Cromlix, which seats only 28. Murray purchased the 15-bedroom country home for £1.8m in 2013. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dunblane on the day to celebrate the wedding of their most famous son. Murray attended the primary school in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed sixteen children and one teacher in the Dunblane massacre. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. 'Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I'm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.' The cathedral's minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, added: 'There is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.' Tom Casey, chair of Discover Dunblane, the organisation which represents the town's traders, said the couple would be 'Dunblane's royalty'. He said: 'A number of shops will be doing individual things to mark the event as they normally do when Andy is playing tennis. 'As a town, we are going to put up some bunting and wedding bows along the high street and decorate the shops with messages. 'Of course we will be making extra efforts to celebrate the wedding of Dunblane's most famous son of modern sense. He is our royalty. 'But it is also important we respect the family's wishes.' Next week's ceremony will take place at the 12th century Dunblane Cathedral (pictured) The reception will then be at Cromlix House (pictured), the five-star 15-bedroom country hotel Murray bought for £1.8million two years ago . The couple announced their engagement in November last year. Breaking with tradition, Murray will have three best men at his wedding, his brother Jamie, close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins (who recovered from cancer to return to tennis) and former training partner Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Murray said: 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, ""why is that fine for you?"" 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. 'She was like, ""Come on, come on, pick one"". I said, ""No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come'."" Murray has previously played best man at Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins tied the knot with Lindsay Wood last year. The tennis star roars in celebration after defeating Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi final yesterday . In previous interviews on the subject, Murray has said he is not fazed by the prospect of marriage. 'Kim and I had spoken about getting married a lot for the past couple of years but, if you go back a couple of years, we were still only 25. 'We've been together since we were 18. Because we were so young when we started - and we do spend a lot of time apart - it just felt like the right time for both of us.' Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. They split briefly in 2009, before rekindling their relationship. The couple live in Surrey with their two Border terriers, Maggie and Rusty. Back on the court, Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open tomorrow. Third seed Murray beat Czech eighth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 yesterday to reach the final for a fourth time.","Murray says he has left majority of planning the day to fiancée, Kim Sears .

9594,"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

482,"(CNN)There's a stampede of investigators in California. The FBI said Friday that it will investigate whether civil rights were violated during the videotaped beating of a suspect in San Bernardino. The suspect  allegedly fled by car, foot and horseback when law enforcement officers tried to arrest him. Earlier Friday, San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said criminal investigations have begun into the actions of deputies as well as the suspect. In addition, an internal investigation has been launched. Ten deputies identified as being involved in the case have been put on paid administrative leave, McMahon said Friday. In video captured by cameras aboard a helicopter for KNBC, deputies gather around the man after he falls from a horse he was riding to flee from them. The video shows deputies using a stun gun on him and then repeatedly kicking and hitting him. KNBC reported that the man -- identified by authorities as Francis Pusok -- appeared to be kicked 17 times, punched 37 times and hit with a baton four times. Pusok was later hospitalized, KNBC reported, citing authorities. ""The video surrounding this arrest is disturbing and I have ordered an internal investigation be conducted immediately,"" McMahon said in a statement. ""What I saw on the television was thugs beating up my client,"" said Jim Terrell, Pusok's family attorney, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. ""That's what I saw. And these questions about what was he doing? What did they do? This is far worse than Rodney King."" The ACLU of Southern California issued a statement Friday saying that it was ""deeply troubled"" by the images. ""While we applaud Sheriff John McMahon's prompt decision to investigate the disturbing actions of his deputies, we believe more is needed,"" the organization said. ""Too often the department has failed to address questions, including those raised by the ACLU SoCal, about use of force and Taser policies."" Coming soon: An app to report police brutality . The Thursday afternoon incident began when deputies tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Pusok fled in a vehicle, and deputies pursued him through the unincorporated area of Apple Valley, the town of Apple Valley and farther into the unincorporated area of Hesperia, the sheriff's office said in a news release. Pusok abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into steep, rugged terrain, with deputies pursing with off-highway vehicles and helicopters, the sheriff's office said. ""Within minutes, deputies received information that the suspect came into contact with a group of people near the Deep Creek Hot Springs and stole a horse. He fled on horseback on dirt trails, through very rugged, steep terrain, causing numerous injuries to the horse,"" the sheriff's office said. A helicopter dropped deputies onto the ground, and as they approached Pusok to make the arrest, he was thrown from the horse, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said a Taser was used on Pusok but was ineffective because of his loose clothing. A deputy was injured when the horse Pusok had been riding kicked him, the Sheriff's Department said. Two other deputies were treated for dehydration. The incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of police use of force after the 2014 deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the recent shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina. In the California case, the FBI said the results of its investigation will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California and Justice Department in Washington to determine whether prosecution is warranted.

But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' As one of Murray's fiercest rivals on the court, it's not surprising Djokovic isn't at the top of the guest list but it seems that, unlike a lot of famous faces, the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite. Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' Who made the list? British player Jamie Delgado (left) is a close friend of Murray's but celebrity pals such as James Corden (right), who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the US, won't be attending . There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. Bride-to-be Kim was spotted cheering on her fiancé this weekend as he battled Novak Djokovic in the men's final at the Miami Open before the couple fly back to Scotland ahead of their nuptials. For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. There's a friendly rivalry on court between Andy Murray and tennis world number one Novak Djokovic but the Serbian won't be attending Murray's nuptials this weekend . Lady in waiting: Kim Sears watched her husband-to-be lose to Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Florida last weekend. Hundreds of well-wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at Dunblane Cathedral, before Andy and Kim hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel Cromlix House . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim’s been pretty much doing it' 'I’ve tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven’t been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn’t think I was going to. He added: 'It’s a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now.

This is the drill that was used by thieves during the £60million Hatton Garden heist over the Easter weekend. The gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems. The photograph of the Hilti DD350 drill was released tonight by Scotland Yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an 'Ocean's 11 type team'. Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid. The six men were captured on CCTV as they carried out the bold raid in London's diamond district. They used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank's strongroom, where they ransacked security vaults. But, amazingly, the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement. Images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in London's diamond district. Safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty Hilti DD350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby. Scotland Yard also described how there was rubbish covering the Hatton Garden basement, while the wrought-iron cage door had been broken down. An angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes. Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building, indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. One of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. The thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor, before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene - to climb down to the vault.

Unaware: The men had their faces covered, but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera . They then opened shutter doors into the basement, before boring holes into the basement wall. Appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch tonight, Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Flying Squad, said that the theft had been carried out by an 'almost Ocean's 11 type team'. Mr Turner said: 'This was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims. 'People's property has been taken, people's pensions, people's heirlooms which obviously can't be replaced by insurance firms. 'We may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost Ocean's 11 type team, but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves.' Destruction: Dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in London, where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor . Covered in dust and debris: Left, the forced door to the vault and, right, the mess left in the corridor . Inside knowledge: The gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door, pictured . Carefully planned: Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft (pictured) to climb down . Peter Kirkham, a former DCI with the Met Police who worked for the Flying Squad for five years in the mid-90s, said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job. Another former Flying Squad detective said: 'Everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it. Thursday, April 2: Workers from businesses in the building go home for long Easter weekend. Some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in. Friday, April 3: Police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises, but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21. No police car was sent. Traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he 'wasn't paid enough' to look inside the vaults. Saturday, April 4, Sunday April 5 and Monday, April 6: The exact time of the raid has not been confirmed, but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes, it is thought to have taken many hours. Tuesday, April 7: At 8am, workers return to the building and finding 'scenes of chaos'. They call the police, who attend. 'There is an expertise, combined with strength, patience, determination and, probably, an inside knowledge.' Releasing the scene images yesterday, Scotland Yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a 'significant amount of time'. The force said the team had recorded, packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits, including items for DNA profiling, fingerprints and other evidence. Specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises, it said. Speaking tonight, Mr Turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the Hatton Garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. Describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a 'specialised bit of equipment', he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch. There are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police, Mr Turner said. 'I appeal to any of those victims who haven't been contacted by police to contact the incident room,' he added. The police previously released CCTV footage showing the suspects believed to be involved in the heist . The picture showed three suspects, using a side door to the building, as well as a van used by the gang .","Gang used power tool to cut a hole into basement of safety deposit centre .

948,"(CNN)The United States Department of Justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs, and the charges are serious indeed. A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in California bristles with accusations of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the Controlled Substances Act, misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. Who is this menace to society? FedEx. Yes, the courier delivery service. Wait, can companies even be charged with crimes?  Where would a FedEx be incarcerated?  Is there a corporate Shawshank Prison?  How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person. It's a practice the Supreme Court has approved of for over a century. In fact, in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people.  Corporations don't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes. Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive, but corporate convictions, on the other hand, turn tidy profits for the U.S. government, with zero prison overhead. Even if corporations can be held criminally liable, should a courier service like FedEx be held liable for ""possessing"" what bad guys may send through the service? The answer, according to FedEx, is not just ""No,"" but a ""No"" so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom. The company maintains that it is innocent. It has a point. ""Possession"" is an elusive concept.  When it comes to drugs, the law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual and constructive. Actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband. When you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket, you ""actually"" possess those things. The somewhat hazier concept of ""constructive possession"" means you can ""possess"" something without even having it on your person, as long as you have ownership, dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found. For example, the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 OxyContin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway, you ""constructively"" possessed them. Conversely, sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle, but not ""possess"" it either actually or constructively, in the eyes of the law. Such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home, walk up to your door and hand you a package, completely ignorant about what is inside it. It's hard to argue the UPS guy intentionally ""possessed"" your subscription to porno mags, in their nondescript brown packaging. That is the idea behind the ""common carrier"" exception to possession, and a large part of FedEx's compelling legal argument. A ""common carrier"" is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation. The public policy reasons behind ""common carrier"" exemptions make sense; the industry simply couldn't function if every driver, courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of OxyContin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door. That would lead to an absurd result. That's why the Controlled Substances Act and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances, so long as it is in the usual course of their business. Of course, this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves ""common carriers."" That's why the ""usual course of business"" language acts as an additional safety measure. In court papers, FedEx's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from Jamaica to Miami. This would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier, since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public, generally. On the other hand, FedEx argues that it is indeed a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because (a) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and (b) it offers its services to the public generally. It's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband. Does this mean a Greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger? The bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs. But if the guy boards the bus with a Grateful Dead T-shirt and a set of bongos, shouldn't the driver at least have a hunch? That seems dangerously close to profiling. Is this another illogical straw man argument? Maybe. Obviously, the Department of Justice disagrees, which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution. According to the indictment, from at least as early as 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, and members of Congress put FedEx on notice that illegal Internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and numerous state laws. The indictment alleges that as early as 2004, FedEx knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts. FedEx's couriers in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to FedEx senior management. The DOJ is making the argument that even though FedEx carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public, FedEx knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity. It raises a larger question, though: Why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we can't even incarcerate? The answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs, and drug smugglers smuggle them: Money. Power. The government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case, it would be to force FedEx to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation. The government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in ""deferred prosecution agreements."" The reason you don't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements; for a company, a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence, whether or not it's found guilty. Still, every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines. Don't get me wrong: I'm all about prosecuting the black market, especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with ""V1AGRA"" in the subject line, for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom. I want those guys locked up for sure. I'm just not sure that FedEx has anything to do with the kingpins of the ""FR33 CYALIS"" email campaign. The DOJ's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain. It makes good strategic sense. It might seem like good financial sense in the short run, with the millions in fines extracted from corporations, but that money has to come from somewhere. It's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights. It probably doesn't make good legal sense either. Yes, we have been treating corporations as fictional ""persons"" for centuries in some ways -- but it's silly to treat them as persons in all ways. FedEx has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon.","Justice Department prosecuting FedEx over unauthorized shipment of drugs .

2095,"Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. The SNP demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds - as the latest price of propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street in the event of a hung Parliament. Miss Sturgeon said the rising retirement age was particularly unfair for pensioners in Scotland because they don’t live as long as their counterparts in the rest of the country. Raising the retirement age is unfair on Scottish pensioners because they die younger, Nicola Sturgeon declared yesterday. She is pictured at the Westerton Care Home during an election campaign visit in Glasgow . The SNP leader demanded the retirement age be frozen - in a move which would cost billions of pounds . At the same time, she issued a demand for a huge inflation-busting increase in the State pension, which would cost billions of pounds more. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113. Parts of Scotland have among the lowest life expectancies of any part of the UK. In central Glasgow it is less than 73 years for men and for women less than 79. Across Scotland the figure is about 76 for men and 80 for women. In England and Wales the figures are nearly 79 for men and nearly 83 for women. But various studies have linked lower life expectancy in Scotland to higher rates of alcohol consumption, smoking, and poor diet. It is also linked to levels of poverty and housing. Her comments will raise concerns that the SNP will demand a more expensive pension system across the whole of the UK which will benefit Scotland most. Miss Sturgeon said the flat rate pension should increase to ‘at least’ £160 a week. It is currently £113 . Speaking on a visit to a care home in East Dunbartonshire, Miss Sturgeon said: ‘The Tory/Lib Dem government’s plan to further increase the state pension age is a worry to people across the UK who are planning for their future, but the failure to take Scotland’s specific circumstances into account is particularly unfair. ‘Our comparatively low life expectancy rate is an issue which I will do everything in my power to change but in the meantime it would be completely unacceptable for people in Scotland who have paid in to a state pension all of their lives to lose out.’ ‘That is why SNP MPs will reject any plans for a further increase in the state pension age.’ ‘Our pensioners have contributed hugely to society and are entitled to get a fair deal in their retirement in return. She said the SNP would ensure that ‘the contribution older people have made throughout their lives is recognised’ if they hold the balance of power after the election. Miss Sturgeon also issued a demand for the single tier pension to increase to at least ‘to ensure pensioners are no longer subjected to the scourge of means-tested benefits.’ The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped . A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Capping the state pension age in Scotland will cost hardworking taxpayers across Britain more than £12.5 billion. ‘This gives another glimpse into a future with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, in the SNP’s pocket – meaning more borrowing, more spending, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ On Sunday Miss Sturgeon said the SNP would be prepared to prop up a minority Labour government even if Ed Miliband lost the election. She said the party’s MPs would vote to support Labour even if the party won fewer seats than the Conservatives on May 7. The SNP have demanded an end to ‘austerity’ and for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped. For many years, the UK state pension age for men was 65 and the state pension age for women was 60. But from 2020, both men and women’s retirement age will be 66, increasing to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and then linked to life expectancy after that. The government will then review the state pension age every five years. During last year’s referendum campaign, the SNP argued the level should only increase to 66 in Scotland, because a lower life expectancy means pensioners receive between £10,000 and £11,000 less.","SNP said retirement age should be frozen, in a move costing billions .

She has demanded that the state pension age be frozen, and for a vast increase in the state pension. The SNP have demanded an end to austerity and also for the Trident nuclear missile system to be scrapped; they have indicated that they could support a minority Labour government after the forthcoming general election, even if Ed Miliband loses. The wider UK state pension age for both men and women is due to rise to 66 in 2020, with moves towards an eventual linkage to life expectancy levels.
","The leader of Scotland's National Party (SNP), Nicola Sturgeon, has demanded that the retirement age be frozen with a significant increase in the state pension in return for supporting Ed Milliband's Labour Party. She cited the fact that Scottish life expectancy was among the lowest in the UK as a reason for the demands. The SNP plan to increase the flat rate pension to at least £160 a week, from the current £113, a move which would cost billions of pounds. The call for an end to austerity and the scrapping of the Trident nuclear missile system have already been made by the SNP."

401,"Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. ""It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,"" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an ""unprecedented"" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.","A robotic probe into the Fukushima nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor .

3684,"Smartphones often overheat if they're held close to the body or are used for long periods of time. And while the dangers of overheating lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries have been known for some time, researchers have now revealed exactly what happens inside the 'burning' cells. Thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent. Scroll down for video . Researchers subjected Lithium-ion batteries to heat and used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe changes in their internal structure. Copper inside melted, indicating temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F), and it caused molten material to stream from the vent (pictured) The footage is the first time the failure of Li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded. It was filmed by Paul Shearing  from University College London and the findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. Li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway, which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost. Although battery failure is rare, prevention of thermal runaway presents one of the greatest challenges for the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. Dr Shearing and his colleagues subjected two commercial Li-ion batteries, known as Cell 1 and Cell 2, to external heat. They then used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe the internal structure of each. Li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway, which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost. A Li-ion battery before being subjected to high temperatures is shown left, the same battery after heat abuse is shown right . During tests, one cell remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued, hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery’s vent (pictured left to right). By comparison, the rapid pressure rise in a second cell caused the entire cap of the cell to detach . Cell 1 remained intact during battery failure and as the heat-generating reactions continued, hot gas followed by molten material jetted out through the battery’s vent. Li-ion batteries have been known to overheat and are vulnerable to thermal runaway. This occurs when the rate of heat generated in the cell is greater than the rate of heat lost. Lithium-ion cells with cobalt cathodes, for example, are not designed to rise above 130°C (265°F). This is because, at 150°C (302°F) the cell becomes 'thermally unstable'. Once it reaches this state it can lead to a thermal runaway in which flaming gases are released. During a thermal runaway, the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell, causing it to become thermally unstable as well. In some cases, a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates one-by-one. This means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds, or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours. As a safety measure, packs are fitted with dividers to protect failing cells from affecting nearby cells. Source: Battery University . The copper material inside Cell 1 melted, indicating internal temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F). By comparison, the rapid pressure rise in Cell 2 caused the entire cap of the cell to detach. In a real-world situation this could have increased thermal runaway because it allows oxygen into the cell. During a thermal runaway, the high heat in the failing cell can travel to the next cell, causing it to become thermally unstable as well. In some cases, a chain reaction occurs in which each cell disintegrates one-by-one. This means a battery pack can be destroyed within seconds or the venting of gases and heat can last for hours. As a safety measure, packs are fitted with dividers to protect the failing cell form affecting nearby cells. The authors found that thermal and electrochemical reactions inside both cells produced gas pockets that deformed the spiral wound layers of the cells. Cell 2 showed severe internal distortion of its architecture, which the authors suggest compromised its safety. Unlike Cell 2, Cell 1 was designed with a central cylindrical support, which seemed to help maintain its structural integrity. The authors hope their observations will lead to improvements in the design of Li-ion batteries and improve their safety features.","Researchers subjected two Lithium-ion batteries to external heat .

The footage shows images of copper reaching 1,085C, causing jets of molten material to burst from the battery. While the dangers of overheating batteries have been known for some time, this is the first time researchers have looked inside the devices to observe changes in their structure. Li-ion batteries frequently overheat if they are used for long periods of time and prevention of thermal runaway is one of the key challenges for the safe operation of such batteries.","Researchers from University College London have used thermal imaging and non-invasive high-speed imaging techniques to study overheated lithium-ion batteries in a real-world environment.

With overheating batteries vulnerable to a condition known as ""thermal runaway,"" which can cause failure of the entire battery pack in seconds, the researchers hope their observations will lead to improved safety features in future designs."
2605,"Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079 . In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly. One method is to lower their starting price, but this isn’t always desirable. Sellers on eBay who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices, such as this watch example . While eBay is used for auctions, the bulk of its business comes from 'Buy it now' sales, such as this iPhone. The study found that prices that end in '00' as above are more likely to sell quickly, but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers . Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed the problem in a new paper. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California looked at pricing strategies within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. Most trades on the site are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530). This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. The study found that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. Matt Backus, Thomas Blake and Steve Tadelis looked at this issue within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. While some people associate eBay with auctions rather than straightforward sales, this hasn’t been eBay’s main business for about a decade. Instead, most trades are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530), to which the seller could then accept or make a new offer. This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. But the study shows that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. ‘In other words, you are better off initially asking for a lower price if price was all you cared about,’ Professor Gans writes. The researchers believe that what is going on here is ‘cheap talk’ - an easy-to-make statement that may be true or untrue with no consequences for dishonesty - and not an otherwise reliable signal. There are some sellers who don’t just care about price and, absent any other way of signalling that to buyers, they set their price at a round number. The researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they're willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price . While the study is new, Professor Gans said the technique to sell houses (a stock image is shown) as quickly as possible, or for as much money as possible, is already used by estate agents . Alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness. Either way, the last two digits of the price is 'cheap talk'. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. This is interesting because the last two digits of a price make little difference to the price, Professor Gans notes. The authors wanted to see if their analysis would work in other markets and whether they could guess what the cheap talk prices would be. They found was that while the effect they observed didn’t happen for all other prices, it did arise for prices that ended in 99 cents. Prices ending in 99 cents, or 99 pence, are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the ‘00’ prices, they said. The researchers also discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they are willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price – a trick estate agents already use.","Researchers claim using exact prices when selling goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers .

3708,"A woman has been jailed for using her stiletto heel to inflict permanent injuries on a stranger during an unprovoked attack in a nightclub toilet. Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly struck 20-year-old Amelia Gledhill with the shoe after a row broke out between their friends on a night out in Bradford. Ms Gledhill is said to have been left traumatised by the incident and is still having problems with her eyesight. Shannon Carter, 21 (pictured) has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for attacking Amelia Gledhill, 20, (pictured right) with a stiletto during a night out. Ms Gledhill still has a scar above her right eye . She has also been left with permanent scarring and is afraid to leave the house alone. During the case at Bradford Crown Court, the court was told how there had been a confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of victim in a bar in Bradford city centre earlier in the evening. The court heard how Miss Gledhill and her friend then saw Carter in  NV night club. Despite Miss Gledhill having nothing to do with the argument, Carter then followed the victim into the toilets, where she carried out the 'unprovoked' attack. As well as sustaining an injury just above her right eye, Ms Gledhill also suffered a deep wound to her arm, the court heard. The victim was given stitches at Bradford Royal infirmary. She also had to return to the hospital on a number of occasions for further treatment, the court heard. She was also left with bruises, a permanent scar and with blurred vision in her right eye. The attack took place in NV nightclub (pictured) during a night out in Bradford City Centre. There had been an earlier confrontation between one of Carter's friends and a friend of the victim . The court heard she also had to take time off work and became too afraid to go out, without being accompanied by her boyfriend. Carter, from East Bowling, Bradford, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent. For the defence, Simon Hustler said Carter had nursed her grandmother, looked after her grandfather and was also a carer for her mother. He added that the attack was an isolated incident and that she had committed no further offences. He also told the court that there was evidence of a mental disorder. Sentencing her to three-and-a-half years in jail, Judge David Hatton QC said Carter had caused the victim permanent scarring and other psychological consequences. The judge said: 'This is a tragic case, revealing the frequent danger and consequence of excessive drinking; tragic, not least because I am satisfied that it was out of character.' But he added that it was a serious offence which could only be dealt with by an immediate custodial sentence. Judge Hatton said: 'I judge your risk of reoffending not to be high. I take account of the fact that any sentence of imprisonment will be in itself a considerable punishment.' He added: 'I derive no pleasure whatever from imposing a sentence of imprisonment on a young woman in your position but I would be failing in my public duty if I did not do so.' After the case, Detective Constable Glen Doran, of Bradford District CID, said: 'This was a particularly nasty and unprovoked assault which left the victim with permanent injuries. 'Such incidents will not be tolerated in Bradford District, and I hope the sentence handed down today will serve as a warning to others.'","Shannon Carter, 21, repeatedly hit Amelia Gledhill, 20, in a Bradford club .

5260,"Ricky Woolaston, 35, dressed in uniform bearing the University of Birmingham logo to break into students' houses and steal laptops . A thief who tricked his way into students' homes to steal their belongings was caught when he left his old police charge sheet behind which had his name written on it. Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as a university maintenance engineer to gain access to students' properties before pinching laptops and mobile phones to feed his drug habit. But a court heard he was easily tracked down by police after he left behind his bag at the scene of one of the crimes. Officers searched the rucksack and found it contained a police charge sheet from a previous offence bearing his name and address. The prolific thief was arrested last Friday, and has now been sentenced to four years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to five burglaries. The court heard unemployed Woolaston would walk around the University of Birmingham campus wearing clothes bearing the red-brick university's logo. But he was caught out when he broke into the Biosciences Department on January 29 where he forced open two secure metal cupboards. Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it .

2786,"A sickening propaganda image linked to the Islamic State terrorist group has surfaced showing a newborn baby sleeping next to a grenade, a handgun and what appears to be a birth certificate. The image, which has not been verified,  was re-posted to Twitter on Sunday by an anti-ISIS activist in Syria with the warning:  'This child will be risk to you not just to us'. Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi, a self proclaimed 'founder of the Syrian revolution,' believes the chilling image was released to radicalise the next generation of jihadis. Terror experts have revealed to Daily Mail Australia the snapshot is a showcase of the groups supposed longevity, as well as a compelling window into life within their self-declared caliphate. Scroll down for video . The sickening image of a newborn baby pictured next to a handgun, grenade and Islamic State birth certificate . The post says the newborn child is called ‘Jrah’, while its mothers name is ‘Om’ and its fathers name is ‘Abu.’ It also claims the certificate next to the baby is an 'ISIS issued ID for a child.' The image was believed to be posted by Abu Ward Al-Raqqawi in the hope of garnering attention to the international threat posed by ISIS. The image has yet to be verified but it bears strong similarities to earlier ISIS propaganda. Last September, a harrowing image was released by the group of a baby dressed as a fighter lying on an Islamic state flag beside grenades and enormous automatic firearms. In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a Twitter image of his seven-year-old son gripping the severed head of a Syrian soldier, with the accompanying caption 'that's my boy!' The chilling snapshot was re-posted by anti-Islamic State activists in hopes of garnering international attention to the threat posed by the depraved militant group . The image bears a strong resemblance to earlier ISIS propaganda, such as this image of a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons . Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones told Daily Mail Australia the image appears to be authentic. ‘By showing the birth certificate, and the fact that the group are indoctrinating babies, I think ISIS are indicating they will be around for a long time.’ ‘It’s an interesting signal of life within the caliphate. Obviously by posting opposition to the Islamic State from within their borders the activist is operating with great risk.’ Jones said the post could be an international plea for military intervention on account of the rapid deterioration of life in Raqqa, the stronghold of the Islamic State. In August, notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf released this image of his seven-year-old son  holding a severed head . ISIS has made it a policy to groom children to take part in jihad, brainwashing them from a very young age. Online propaganda is an integral part of this process, with the group using scores of social media accounts to disseminate their messages to youths around the world. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda in Australia. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.

Observers suggest that the emergence of these child-focused propaganda images, which have been surfacing on an increasingly frequent basis since last year, indicates that ISIS is promoting a broad-based appeal on the future of the group as it prepares to move into an active insurgency phase. Such images seem to indicate a shift for the group: while in the past they emphasised territorial control, the images suggest a focus on nurturing a new generation of fighters who might protect the group's ideology.

303,"(CNN)Lauren Hill, who took her inspirational fight against brain cancer onto the basketball court and into the hearts of many, has died at age 19. The Indiana woman's story became known around the world last year when she was able to realize her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up the opening game of its schedule to accommodate her desire to play. Hill died early Friday. At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost ""an unselfish angel."" ""It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,"" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. ""But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many."" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill: . ""I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others."" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. The organization called her a ""worldwide inspiration."" ""Lauren captured the hearts of people worldwide with her tenacity and determination to play in her first collegiate basketball game with her Mount St. Joseph University team,"" the group said on Facebook.

""We are forever grateful to have had Lauren grace our campus with her smile and determined spirit,"" Artez said in a statement. ""She has left a powerful legacy. She taught us that every day is a blessing, every moment a gift."" Her principal at Lawrenceburg High School, Bill Snyder, announced her death to students Friday morning. ""Lauren's message was constantly positive,"" he told CNN. ""We all need to work together to beat obstacles. Not just cancer. In any situation we can be positive."" As news of her death spread, social media lit up with messages honoring her life. NBA great LeBron James called her the ""true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership."" ""The greatest accomplishment we can achieve as humans is to inspire many,"" Twitter user Just_AP wrote. ""Lauren Hill did that."" NCAA President Mark Emmert said Hill's ""enthusiasm and strength were an inspiration not only to those who knew her best, but also to the millions of people she touched around the world by sharing her story."" ""Lauren achieved a lasting and meaningful legacy, and her beautiful spirit will continue to live on,"" he said in a statement. Hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013 when she was a senior in high school. The rare brain tumor was inoperable, but Hill persisted in playing on her high school team despite chemotherapy treatments. ""I never gave up for a second, even when I got a terminal diagnosis, never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,"" she told CNN affiliate WKRC-TV at the time. She had already committed to play for Mount St. Joseph when she was diagnosed. In October, the school received permission from the NCAA to move up its first scheduled game so Hill could play.

1844,"Despite countless campaigns, protests and marches, the notion of blaming a victim for their rape remains shockingly high. The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex – they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk – a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent – by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report – based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people – found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality – women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'","#ThisDoesn'tMeanYes captured images of 200 women across London .

The notion that a woman's dress or sexual behaviour may lead to an attack continues to have traction despite repeated campaigns against rape, with younger people increasingly likely to blame the victim for their own assault, according to Sarah Green from End Violence Against Women Coalition.
","A new campaign called #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes, launched by Rape Crisis London, aims to abolish the myth that women are ""asking for it"" in regards to rape when they dress provocatively. The initiative features 200 women wearing various kinds of clothing and has been photographed, and over 2,000 pictures have been taken for the campaign. The charity claims that no woman deserves to be raped, regardless of what they are wearing. The organisation encourages women to join the movement by posting pictures of themselves wearing whatever clothing they would like, using the same hashtag, on Instagram. The issue of victim blaming in rape cases has also been a topic of discussion in the Crown Prosecution Service, leading to calls by society to challenge views that victims are responsible for their fate because they have been drinking or were dressed provocatively. An ONS report revealed that around 20% of people believe that victims are partially responsible if they are drunk. Younger generations are more likely to blame women for their rape. "
6441,"A King Charles Spaniel suffered three degree burns from a pad used to keep him warm during a scan which vets had heated up in a microwave. Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back . But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was. King Charles Spaniel Alfie, who suffered three degree burns after vets place a heat pad on his back that had been warmed in a microwave . 'They have told me that they always warm them up in microwave but after what happened they have promised to change their practice. 'I am glad that they’ve now said they will do that but it took nearly a week for them to stop the practice.' Alfie is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery to remove some of the skin around the burns. Ms Edwards, an interfaith minister, is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately. The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads. A spokesman said: 'We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20,000 animals. 'In the last five years, around 3,000 of these patients would have had heat pads to maintain their body temperature. 'To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like this before in any of the AHT’s patients. 'We understand how upsetting this situation must be for Lynne Edwards and her family, and have carried out a full investigation. 'We have reviewed, and are updating, our Standard Operating Procedure for the use of heat pads. 'We are also standardising the way in which all heat pads are heated at the AHT.'

7066,"These days, Gazza is a celebrity associated with tears, and battles against drink and depression. But, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Paul Gascoigne was just a footballer. Not an ordinary footballer - he was a brilliantly talented maverick, but still a footballer. And 24 years ago today, he scored what was arguably the finest goal of his career. There are some who might say it was the finest goal ever scored at Wembley. The other main contender for that prize is probably another of his, for England against Scotland at Euro 96. Paul Gascoigne hits the 35-yard free-kick that would cement his place in Tottenham legend . The Spurs midfielder struck a ferocious shot that has gone down as one of the all-time great goals at Wembley . Gascoigne's goal came five minutes into an FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham's arch-rivals, Arsenal . Gunners goalkeeper David Seaman (right) got his hands to the ball but the power on Gascoigne's shot still beat him . But April 14, 1991 was FA Cup semi-final day. Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal. Fierce rivals battling it out for a place in the final when the oldest cup competition in football meant so much to every club that entered. Arsenal won the league that year. But had you asked their fans at Wembley that day whether they would rather win the title or the FA Cup having knocked out Spurs, and many would have opted for the latter. They didn't get the choice, however, and that was because of Gascoigne. It took him just five minutes to make the indelible mark. Tottenham won a free-kick 35 yards from goal. Nobody suspected much. Certainly not Barry Davies, who was commentating on the game for the BBC. Gascoigne runs towards the Spurs fans to celebrate as Vinny Samways (left) joins the wild scenes . The then England star leaps into the air to celebrate his glorious strike at the home of football . Gascoigne's goal set Spurs on their way to a 3-1 victory, and they would go on to beat Nottingham Forest in the final . 'Is Gascoigne going to have a crack?,' he asked. It was a relaxed, throwaway question. 'He is you know,' came the next line shortly after, excitement barely registering. Gascoigne took a run-up at the ball, and swung hard with his right boot. He nailed it, right on the sweet spot. The shot quickly became a cannonball, bursting through David Seaman's gloves and into the top corner of the net, despite the goalkeeper getting his hands to the ball. 'Oh I say!' screamed Davies, whose commentary would now go down in legend as well as the goal. 'Brilliant!' Spurs fans celebrated wildly in the stands. 'That...is... schoolboy's own stuff. Oh, I bet even he can't believe it. 'Is there anything left from this man to surprise us? That is one of the finest free-kicks this stadium has ever seen.' It was, and still is. 24 years from now it still will be. So let's forget for a moment about the Gazza we know today, and simply celebrate the genius of Paul Gascoigne. (left-right) David Howells, Steve Sedgley, Justin Edinburgh and Paul Stewart join Gascoigne to celebrate at the end of the match .","It is 24 years to the day since Paul Gascoigne scored in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal .

11393,"A man who was lost at sea for 66 days, surviving on just fish and rainwater, has left hospital and is in surprisingly good health. Louis Jordan, 37, who was stranded 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina, suffered no sun damage, was not dehydrated and refused treatment when he was checked over in hospital, despite more than two months exposed to the elements. The Coast Guard crew who rescued him said he had a small smile on his face when they landed on his vessel, expecting him to be covered in blisters and have severe sunburn. Scroll down for video . Louis Jordan, second from left, walks from the Coast Guard helicopter to the Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He left hours later on Friday in good health . A pilot lifts him into the helicopter after 66 days stranded 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina . A four-man helicopter team hoisted Jordan off the German vessel on Thursday. In interviews Friday at Coast Guard headquarters in Portsmouth, they said they did not see Jordan's boat and did not know any details about his time at sea. By the time they picked him up — about 5 p.m. Thursday — Jordan had been on the German vessel for a few hours and had been able to take a shower and speak to his family, the guardsmen said. 'He walked over to me as soon as I landed on deck and had a small smile on his face,' said Petty Officer 3rd Class Kyle McCollum, who had the first contact with Jordan. 'My initial impression of him was he was in pretty good health. ... We were expecting worse with blisters and severe sunburn and dehydration.' 'He was in a fairly good condition for a guy that you would normally expect to see after 60-plus days offshore,' added Lt. Jack Shadwick, the helicopter's co-pilot . The crew of a German-flagged container ship found Jordan on his single-masted 35-foot boat Thursday afternoon, Coast Guard officials said. Medical officials said he suffered no dehydration, no significant sun damage and was in good health . Neither he nor the Coast Guard said exactly when Jordan's vessel capsized. Jordan managed to catch and eat fish, according to the Coast Guard, and despite reports of a shoulder injury and dehydration, he arrived at a hospital in good condition and refused treatment, a facility spokesman said. Jordan said he initially didn't believe the container ship was real when he saw it. He said the ship's crew didn't see him until he began waving his arms. Asked about his good condition, Jordan claims he tried to stay inside the boat and conserved as much energy as possible. During an interview with WAVY-TV, he said: 'Every day I was like, 'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.' 'I waved my hands real slowly, and that's the signal 'I'm in distress. Help me,'' he told WAVY. 'I blew my whistles. I had three whistles. They never heard them. I turned my American flag upside down and put that up. That says, ""Rescue me.'' Jordan had been living on his 1950s-era boat at a marina in Conway, South Carolina, near Myrtle Beach, until January, when he told his family he was going into open water to sail and fish, said his mother, Norma Davis. He set out January 23, Coast Guard officials said, and hadn't been heard from since. Jordan told WAVY that he was traveling north when his boat hit bad weather. He said he saw a wave crash into his window, and the boat eventually filled with water. Helicopter pilots were also surprised at his condition when they landed on his vessel. One said Jordan approached him with a smile on his face . In interviews Friday at Coast Guard headquarters in Portsmouth, the crew who recused Jordan (pictrued) said they did not see Jordan's boat and did not know any details about his time at sea . He said he rationed his water to about a pint a day, but 'for such a long a time I was so thirsty.' Jordan said that at one point he was flying through the air, and he thinks he broke his shoulder. McCollum, of the helicopter crew, said Jordan had slight bruising on his right clavicle, but it didn't appear serious: 'He was moving that arm so fluidly, without any skip and there wasn't any sign of pain in his face as he was moving.' On Jan. 29, the Coast Guard in Miami was notified by his father, Frank Jordan, that he hadn't seen or heard from his son in a week, agency spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said. Alerts were issued from New Jersey to Miami, according to the Coast Guard. Officials searched financial data to determine whether Jordan had come ashore without being noticed, but they found no such indication, Fajardo said. A search began Feb. 8 and lasted 10 days, the Coast Guard said. Some sailors reporting seeing Jordan's boat, but no sightings were confirmed. The Coast Guard said Jordan didn't file a 'float plan,' the nautical equivalent of a flight plan, with his route or destination. Jeff Weeks manages the Bucksport Plantation Marina, where Jordan docked his boat. 'He is somewhat of a person who stays to himself,' Weeks said. 'I consider him a gentle giant with a good personality, but he likes to be self-sufficient. 'Here at the marina, he liked to catch most all of the food that he'd eat. He would eat a lot of rice and fish. And he would know what berries and what mushrooms to pick. He was really knowledgeable on some survival skills.'

7759,"Officer Michael Slager is being kept in isolation and can not walk down a hall without the entire cell block being cleared first, according to his lawyer. Slager, 33, is charged with murder after opening fire on Walter Scott, 50, after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday. His attorney Andy Savage told CBS that Slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. Scroll down for video . Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, is charged with murder after opening fire on Walter Scott, 50, after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday. Pictured: Slager and an unknown woman . Slager pictured with two women who have not been identified. His attorney Andy Savage told CBS that Slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail . He said that when he met Slager on Wednesday for 60 minutes, that it took an hour and 45 minutes to move the North Charleston police officer to the meeting place because they had to clear all of the cell blocks. A jail staff member told the New York Daily News: 'He wouldn’t last one week in the general population. Everyone inside is talking about it. Of course people want to get at him.' CBS reports Slager's mother is expected to visit her son Friday for the first time since the shooting. She has defended her son in an interview, saying she cannot believe that he would do anything like what he's accused of. Karen Sharpe (above) the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . She also revealed that his wife, who is eight months pregnant, is devastated. Ms Sharpe said that she will never watch the video footage of the fatal shooting. She also expressed her sympathy for Walter Scott's family, the man her son shot dead. I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, 'Well, you're being in denial,' but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' On Friday it was revealed that no warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he ran from Officer Michael Slager moments before he was shot dead, it has been revealed. Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.","Officer Michael Slager is being held at Charleston County jail .

Slager is housed in a cell with one small window and doesn't have interaction with other detainees at the Charleston County jail. He is expected to last only one week in the general population. No warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he was fatally shot by Slager, and his family believes fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. The police dashboard camera video shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes and running away from the police officer before being shot in the back."
2955,"The Director of Public Prosecutions was under growing pressure to stand down last night over her failure to put Lord Janner on trial for serious child abuse offences. Alison Saunders’s position as the country’s top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the Home Secretary, police chiefs, crime tsars, prominent MPs – and even one of her predecessors. Mrs Saunders said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones. But she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating Establishment cover-ups by deciding that Labour peer Lord Janner should not be charged – despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims dating back to the 1960s. Birthday visit: Lord Janner, right with cake, took Michael Jackson - who was repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court - on tour of Parliament in 2002, together with their mutual friend of Uri Gellar and US magician David Blaine (centre, left). It was the birthday of Labour MP Paul Boateng, alongside Janner . Theresa May became the first Cabinet Minister to question the DPP’s judgment in ruling that the 86-year-old should not be prosecuted on the grounds that his dementia is now too advanced for him to have a fair trial. The Home Secretary told the BBC: ‘I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sexual abuse issue… I expect to see justice done.’ Former DPP Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said it would have been better if Lord Janner had undergone a procedure whereby a jury can decide on the facts of a case without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed, if a suspect is unfit to plead. There have been a number of recent court cases in which defendants with dementia have been jailed, and Lord Janner himself has previously called for Nazi war criminals to be put on trial regardless of their age or frailty. Lord Macdonald added: ‘It might have been wiser for the Crown Prosecution Service to say, ‘‘We’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’’ ’ Adam Simmonds, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, said the decision not to charge Lord Janner on Thursday made it a ‘dark day for our justice system’. He added: ‘A substantial number of victims of child abuse, who have carried the weight of such heinous crimes with them for the best part of two decades, have been terribly let down in the worst possible way.’ He said the DPP’s ruling went against her previously stated commitment to seek justice for victims, no matter how old the allegations. Alison Saunders, right, said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones, Lord Janner, left . Leicestershire Constabulary, which has investigated Lord Janner four times over the past 25 years, is considering an unprecedented legal challenge against the decision. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed the late Cyril Smith as a paedophile, said that the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders meant something had ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, below, he said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases – and has been involved in a number of disputes over the competing rights of suspects and alleged victims in sex assault cases. Her decision in the Lord Janner case could be overturned if the complainants use the ‘Right to Review’ scheme introduced two years ago. A CPS employee with no prior involvement in the case would consider if her decision was the right one. Alleged victims of Lord Janner will eventually be able to share their experiences with the long-delayed public inquiry into historic child abuse to be chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard. However, that investigation faces further setbacks as campaigners are seeking a judicial review of her decision to exclude child abuse survivors from the inquiry panel for being insufficiently objective. The CPS’s handling of previous investigations into Lord Janner is also being reviewed by retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. Last night the CPS said: ‘The DPP is there to make the right legal decision. Her role is to make these very difficult decisions, not to make popular decisions.’ Roadblock to justice must be removed . by Simon Danczuk, MP who exposed the Cyril Smith scandal . MP Simon Danczuk who exposed the Cyril Smith Scandal . A few weeks ago, I met an experienced former Metropolitan Police officer to discuss investigations into high- profile child abusers active in the 1970s. ‘We’re making progress but putting Rolf Harris and Max Clifford behind bars isn’t going to trouble the Establishment,’ he remarked. ‘It’ll be 50 times harder to prosecute a politician. They’re able to call in a lot of favours.’ A year earlier, I’d met police officers from Leicestershire to discuss the case they were putting together against Lord Janner. I could tell they were determined to get a prosecution, but it was the question they put to me next that disturbed me almost as much as the allegations: ‘Do you think there will be any political interference?’ The fact that dedicated frontline officers investigating heinous crimes against vulnerable children should have to ask that in 21st Century Britain is a worrying sign. But it’s one we should come to expect given the continual revelations about previous failures to prosecute high-profile figures for abusing children. The decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to use the public interest test to overrule the evidence when refusing to prosecute Lord Janner is a reminder that outdated attitudes still prevail. They throw our whole justice system into disrepute. Not just because the authorities continue to turn a tin ear to those who have been violated, disbelieved and treated as rubbish for decades. And not just because in admitting previous failures to prosecute Janner, Alison Saunders failed to apologise on behalf of the CPS. It’s appalling because it’s the wrong decision and one she didn’t have to make. For the DPP to shut down any prospect of justice in such a case sends out the worst possible message at the worst possible time, and her reputation is unravelling fast. When the Home Secretary says she’s ‘very concerned’, the former DPP Lord Macdonald is critical, and Leicestershire Police are talking about a legal challenge, then something has clearly gone very badly wrong. So wrong that Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.","Alison Saunders position as the country's top prosecutor looks bleak .

2499,"As a society we believe that our political allegiance depends on which party best marries up with our needs and values, and that these are shaped by our life experiences. But research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties. To put this to the test, the Department of Twin Research, which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the UK, recently performed a poll of voting preferences. Deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate (above) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences . The twins were all born in the UK and were broadly representative of the UK population. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people’s voting habits. Twins provide a unique natural experiment for research. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent. Both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. Twin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes, passed down or by the environment a person is living in. As identical twins share exactly the same DNA, traits produced by genes should appear in both twins. However in non-identical twins the DNA will not be the same and so differences can occur. In most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too. So by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural. However, as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends, cultural experiences and points of view. This can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics. In the case of political views, these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children. However, the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins. Assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood, this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment. By comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. Because twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing, they are an ideal way to study political allegiances. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders. They found that voting Conservative, or not, is strongly influenced by genetics. When it came to voting Tory, they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people’s voting preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. That means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors. For UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent. This was closely followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48 per cent. The exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence. Identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. Geography also played a possible role - as voting for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental. These latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the US. The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders . Voting for the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, pictured above after voting at the last General Election with his wife Samantha, tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of UK twins . A 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins. Previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views, be they for or against. 'We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities,' said the researchers. 'The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities.' 'Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.' The popularity of Nick Clegg (above), leader of the Liberal Democrats seemed to be heritable, although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone, the study showed . The question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses. David Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50 per cent heritability, followed by Nick Clegg at 37 per cent. Views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental. Psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices. But even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about when you approach the ballot box. Professor Tim Spector is the Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London . Victoria Vazquez also contributed to this article.","Study of twins in the UK found voting Conservative tends to run in families .

Geographical and environmental factors did play a role in voting habits, but genetic influence was most dominant in Conservative voters (57%) and was also strong in UKIP (51%), Labour (48%), and the Green Party (48%). There was little influence genetic or environmental for the Liberal Democrats voters.","A study conducted by the Department of Twin Research suggests that voting preferences may be influenced by genetics rather than the policies of political parties.

6232,"Children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school. The pledge is contained in a ‘home-school agreement’ which all children must sign before they start at Turnham Primary School in September. The infants must also promise to refrain from using homophobic and racist phrases and to be tolerant of people with different sexual orientations and lifestyles. Each child must print their name and provide a signature to confirm that they understand their ‘responsibilities’ while attending the school. Anti-bullying: Turnham Primary School - led by executive headteacher Selina Sharpe - sent out an agreement for all new children to sign before they start in the new academic year . Tick-box bureaucracy: But parents were dumbfounded when it included a demand not to use 'transphobic language', as it would mean explaining something many three-year-olds are not even aware exists . It is understood that teachers at the South-East London school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures. But yesterday the chairman of governors said that they knew nothing about the change to the contract, which was also dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by parents who said pre-school children could not be expected to understand such complex issues. The contract was sent to parents last week along with the letters offering a place at the school. It reads: ‘We believe that every child can and should reach their full potential. This is achieved when all staff, parents and children understand their responsibilities and work together towards the same goals, as detailed in our home-school agreement.’ In a list of responsibilities for pupils to sign is a clause which states pupils will be tolerant of ‘sexual orientation or lifestyle and refrain from using racist or homophobic or transphobic language in school’. The contract does not say what will happen to pupils who disobey the clauses. Yesterday, one mother said: ‘My son is three yet he is meant to pledge not to use “transphobic” language. ‘How am I meant to explain it to my three-year-old that he must sign on the dotted line not to do something which he is not even aware exists when he can barely hold a crayon? This just fills me with dread about what sort of politically correct, tick-box bureaucracy runs this school. ‘I agree that teachers need to be made aware of transgender issues as it affects a number of children who suffer in silence, but to make three-year-olds sign up to something they do not even know exists is bonkers.’ Sorry: The school's chair of governors has apologised for any offence or distress caused to parents or pupils . Turnham Primary is a foundation school, which means it is funded by the Government through Labour-run Lewisham Council, which yesterday refused to comment on the matter. The school, led by executive head teacher Selina Sharpe, also declined to comment. Yesterday, Robert Mapp, chairman of governors, said he was not aware of ‘the change in format’ to the home-school agreement. He said Miss Sharpe was an ‘interim executive head’ at Turnham, adding: ‘Given she is a Lewisham Council employee who was personally referred to Turnham Primary Foundation School by the executive director for children and young people, Frankie Sulke, I am surprised the local authority have elected not to comment on the matter once. ‘On behalf of the governing body I would like to sincerely apologise for any offence or distress caused to our parents and pupils. Until I have held a full inquiry into the matter, I am not in a position to make any further comment.’ The controversy comes in the wake of the Coalition’s British Values drive, which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. It was introduced last year in response to the Trojan Horse scandal, which saw schools in Birmingham allegedly infiltrated by Muslim hardliners hoping to impose an Islamic agenda. But since then, schools have complained they have been penalised by Ofsted for failing to meet the criteria. Two Christian schools in the North East said pupils were asked ‘inappropriate’ questions on race and sexuality – and branded intolerant when they gave the wrong answers. One ten-year-old girl was left in tears after inspectors allegedly asked her ‘whether she felt trapped in someone else’s body’. Two years ago Turnham Primary came to national attention when Cliff Pearce, then chairman of governors, claimed expenses for travel to the school for meetings from his home in Menorca in Spain.","Turnham Primary School demands pupils sign 'agreement' before  starting .

The agreement was designed to address playground prejudice against a range of disabilities and cultures. The statement caused confusion among parents who felt that the average three-year-old would not be aware of such a complex issue or able to understand the context. There is no clarity in the contract about what will happen to pupils who disobey the clauses. ","A primary school in South-East London has asked children as young as three to sign a home-school agreement, which includes the pledge to abstain from using racist, homophobic, and transphobic language. Parents expressed dismay over the demand, arguing that pre-school children could not understand such complex issues, and labelled the agreement as “politically correct tick-box bureaucracy”. The school stated that the aim of the agreement was to combat playground prejudice against transgender people, disabilities, and different cultures. Turnham Primary School is founded by the government through Lewisham council, and is committed to the Coalition’s British Values drive, which requires tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles.

As people clamor to find out about this humble champ from Texas, a letter penned six years ago when he was still in high school has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image. As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the grateful golfer wrote the letter to the Murphy family who had funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition. Scroll down for video . A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth six years ago when he was on a scholarship at Jesuit High School in Dallas, left, has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image . As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the PGA golfer was humble enough to write the letter to the Murphy family who funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition . In the thank you note, Spieth wrote that he earned the scholarship from a work grant program, reports The Dallas Morning News. Spieth, already dreaming about winning the Masters, was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he's the No. 1 junior golfer in the country. The 21-year-old impressed many following Sunday's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. He then went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. 'He's just a class guy in every way and it's difficult not to root for him,' said golf legend Phil Mickelson.

Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Another legend impressed by Spieth was Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: 'Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. 'Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He's polite, he's humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.' The one family member who wasn't present to enjoy the celebrations was Jordan's 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. The siblings regularly Facetime each other and every time they talk Ellie asks he brother if he has won yet. 'I'll finally be able to tell her yes,' he said, smiling. 'I know she was watching on television and I think she's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,' he said. 'She's going to want a present.' Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . Golf should not have been Spieth's game at all. Nobody in the family plays — they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13 million on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: 'I don't see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,' it does not come across as at all boastful. Jesuit High School was recently in the news for all the wrong reasons when the Daily Mail Online exposed former pupil, Parker Rice, as one of the Oklahoma University students filmed conducting his Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers along in a racist chant on a bus last month.","A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth when he was 16-years-old has surfaced which reinforces his nice guy image .

7490,"A boy of 13 has become one of the UK's youngest murderers after he was jailed for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek. Shocking CCTV footage shows the horrendous moment Petri Kurti murdered 47-year-old Glynis Bensley before he fled to a nearby park in Smethwick, West Midlands and boasted about the savage attack. The schoolboy, who can be named after a judge lifted a reporting restriction order, was jailed for a minimum of 12 years today and will be on licence for life. His co-defendant, Zoheb Majid, was sentenced to 10 years behind bars for manslaughter and robbery. Scroll down for video . CCTV of the attack was shown in court, with 13-year-old Kurti seen jumping Ms Bensley as she walked home. Co-defendant Majid then joined in, with the pair leaving her for dead in a pool of her own blood . Killed: Glynis Bensley was murdered by Petri Kurti, 13, as she walked home in Smethwick, West Midlands . Sentencing Judge John Warner said the boy had been 'running wild' in his home life. 'You come from a home where there has been a complete lack of boundaries or structure where neither parents understand the seriousness of your behaviour - they blame others. 'This reinforces your own clear reluctance to take responsibility for your own actions.' Previously the court heard how the pair had teamed up with the sole intention of carrying out a violent robbery. CCTV footage captured Kurti jumping Ms Bensley in the street as she made her way home from Seven Stars pub. Majid joined in seconds later before the pair flipped her body over to ransack her pockets. Kurti was then filmed stamping on her face, leaving a shoe print on her skin. The court previously heard that both Majid and the teenager thought Ms Bensley was a man because of her clothes and haircut. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but was found guilty of murder following a trial last month. Kurti had been excluded from school and a pupil referral unit for his aggressive behaviour, and as young as he was, already had previous convictions for attempted theft, assault with intent to steal and battery. He sentenced the 13-year-old to 12 years imprisonment for the murder with five years concurrent for robbery. Also jailed: Zoheb Majid, 20, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for manslaughter and robbery . He was given another 12 months, to run concurrently, for another street robbery carried out with his 25-year-old sister whilst on bail for the murder on February 4. The teenager was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure - the equivalent of a minimum term life sentence for a youth. Judge Warner added while Kurti had boasted of the attack afterwards, he demonstrated 'criminal maturity'. 'I'm in no doubt that she was targeted by you both, selected to be robbed' he continued. 'She was chosen by you because she was clearly in a vulnerable condition. 'It started with you Petri Kurti punching her and she went to the ground. 'She suffered a minimum of two blows. There was a clear print of a shod foot visible on her cheek, she had been stamped in the face. 'You Petri Kurti were just 13 when you committed this murder, on the streets late at night effectively running wild. 'This was a murder committed for gain, a night time robbery. The victim was vulnerable and targeted as such. 'Zoheb Majid, you're about to turn 21. 'You knew what you were doing and knew what you were involved in. You knew the victim of this night time robbery was a vulnerable person.' Earlier the court was told Kurti 'was not a mature' 13-year-old. His solicitor, Michael Turner QC, said: 'He's operating at a level of a seven to 11-year-old in terms of his cognitive ability. 'He has real learning difficulties. He accepted the act that caused the death and limited the decision of the jury to one of intent. Distraught family: Ms Bensley's siblings, Dawn and Harry Bensley, were at Wolverhampton Crown Court today to see their sister's killer jailed . 'He is susceptible to control and influence by those older than him.' After their sentencing Ms Bensley's family spoke of their horror that the 13-year-old had been out so late and behaving in such a violent way. 'It opens your eyes to a different world. We are talking two o'clock, four o'clock in the morning - that is not a normal 13-year-old,' said John Bensley, 60. 'They are cowards, the way they did it. She was an easy target.' 'Justice has been done. If it hadn't happened to Glynis it would have happened to someone else. It could have happened to anybody. 'They seemed a bit arrogant in court, there was no remorse. They are not sorry, they are sorry they have been caught."" Paying tribute to the charity worker, Ms Bensley's sister, Dawn, said: 'She loved working for charities. She just liked to help people, she would help anybody."" Detective Chief Inspector Samantha Ridding said the pair had intended to target someone in a violent robbery . Her brother Kevin, 53, added: 'Glynis had walked down that road for 30 years and never had a problem. 'She walked the same way for 30 years, they must have crossed paths before. Whether he was 13, 33, or 53, it doesn't make it any easier.' Leading the investigation Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted: they were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis’ family at this time and we hope that today’s sentencing will provide some help in their grieving process.'","Petri Kurti has been jailed for 12 years for the murder of Glynis Bensley .

8424,"Crystal clear waters have revealed a number of haunting hulls belonging to ships that succumbed to the perils of Lake Michigan over the centuries. The unusual transparency has been caused by surface ice melting, unveiling the boat graveyard at the bottom of the Great Lake, before organisms like plankton conceal them once more. The soul-stirring images were snapped during a routine helicopter patrol by the U.S. Coast Guard, who had a perfect view of normally obscured wreckage in an area where many ships foundered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Scroll down for video . Revealed: The 121-foot brig of the James McBride, which ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857, has been revealed following ice-melt in Lake Michigan . Rising Sun: The 133 foot long wooden steamer stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, and can be seen on the bottom of the Great Lake . Glory days: The Rising Sun was owned by a religious group called the House of David when it crashed in October 1917. Members of the group were returning from High Island, where they spend the summer, when it crashed in a sudden snowstorm . Graveyard: The above map shows the Manitou Passage of Lake Michigan, which is home to dozens of shipwrecks due to the unpredictable weather on the lake. The wrecks of the James McBride and Rising Sun were exposed this month after ice melted on the lake . Unpredictable weather makes Lake Michigan home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world with sudden storms, fire, and fog causing the destruction of these many thousands of vessels over the years. The pictures are taken of the shallow waters of the lake off the Leelanau Peninsula near Leland, known as the Manitou Passage, between the mainland of the northwestern Lower Peninsula and North and South Manitou Islands. This area alone is home to dozens of shipwrecks, most which were grounded shipping lumber at the turn of the 20th century. The Coast Guard wasn’t immediately able to identify the wrecks, but with help from fans on Facebook, they learned that two of them are the James McBride and the Rising Sun. The 121-foot brig James McBride ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857. Her remains now lie in 15 feet of water near Sleeping Bear Point. The James McBride is believed to be the first ship to haul cargo from the West Indies all the way back to Chicago, when it completed a trip to Turk Island for salt in 1848, stopping at Nova Scotia on the way back for cod. Eerie: This unknown wreck was captured by the US Coast Guard from a helicopter during a routine patrol over the Great Lake . Rare sightings: Two wrecks can just be seen (top left and bottom right of picture) through the clear waters of Lake Michigan . Stunning scenery: A house can be seen on the edge of the lake which endures unpredictable weather and is home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world . It launched on April fool’s day in 1848 and sank nine years later after carrying a cargo of wood from the Manitou Islands. The Rising Sun was a 133-foot-long wooden steamer which stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, because of an early snow storm. Lifeboats were scrambled and all 32 people on board were saved but she went to pieces. Her wreckage now rests in about 12 feet of water. The Rising Sun was actually first named the Minnie M, but it was renamed the Rising Sun when it was purchased by a religious group called the House of David in 1913. The commune was founded by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in Benton Harbor, Michigan in 1903. Benjamin claimed to be the younger brother of Jesus, and his group of about 900 followers called him King Ben. During the summer, the group lived on High Island - located about thirty miles northwest of Charlevoix, Michigan. In October 1917, Captain Charles Morrison was taking  passengers and crew members from the group back to Benton Harbor where they would spend the winter when a sudden snowstorm hit. The captain tried to make Charlevoix, but the ship pushed west into the Manitou Passage where it crashed into a set of submerged boulders. Everyone on board survived the crash, escaping on two sets of lifeboats. Protected: The wrecks of the stricken vessels are protected by law to stop divers trying to salvage anything from the sunken history . The U.S Park Service, which manages the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, announced last month that the wreckage of the Jennie & Annie was now visible again on the beach halfway between North and South Bar lakes. The schooner grounded off Empire in 1872 and is visible every few years. Beach erosion, waves, wind and variable water levels in the lake cause the wrecks to periodically become visible along the dunes shoreline. Since the shipwrecks are considered public property, they are not allowed to be disturbed. However, divers are allowed to explore the wrecks in warmer weather.

7995,"On the eve of the County Championship season, Charlie Hemphrey has finally secured the professional cricket contract he has been striving for over the past decade. Only it is not with one of the 18 teams that make up our domestic game. For Hemphrey, a 25-year-old former Folkestone grammar school pupil who suffered habitual rejection in his attempts to breakthrough into the English system, has an amazing story to tell, after forging an unlikely first-class career in Australia. It has been an extraordinary journey for Hemphrey from a second XI debut for Kent at 15 to his recent status as the first Englishman to hit a Sheffield Shield hundred since John Hampshire for Tasmania in 1978. That feat was accomplished in Queensland's final match of the 2014-15 season, a victory over South Australia at the Gabba. Charlie Hemphrey during his Kent career (left) and as a youngster for Notts under 11s where he scored his first hundred (right) When he emigrated to Brisbane 18 months ago, he admits his desire for a shot at the top level had regressed into an 'unrealistic dream'. That it became a reality was due to polar opposite experiences to the ones he endured over here. Every time he was faced with a door it opened whereas previously they had slammed in his face. Kent, Derbyshire and Essex all knocked him back. A stunning first season down under – in which he finished third top scorer in Queensland's grade competition – was followed by a state second XI debut last October. The following month he struck 140 out of 297 all out in the first innings of a game against New South Wales. It put him in the frame for higher honours when the Shield season reopened post-Big Bash and a new year injury to Australia batsman Usman Khawaja gave him his chance. On February 7 he pulled on the maroon cap for the first time. James Pattinson dismissed him for a second-ball duck but Queensland – showing numerous changes in the wake of Stuart Law's removal as coach – crushed eventual champions Victoria by an innings. The following week Hemphrey hit 58 and Tasmania were defeated in Hobart by a similar scoreline. Two matches, two victories; the Pom had hit the jackpot. Queensland were not going to change a winning side and that very fact secured his future. Matches 5 . Innings 8 . Not Outs 0 . Runs 310 . Highest Innings Score 118 . Batting Average 38.75 . Balls Faced 809 . Batting Strike Rate 38.31 . 100s 1 . 50s 1 . 4s 37 . 6s 0 . 'The system over here guarantees you a minimum contract if you play three state games,' Hemphrey explained to Sportsmail. 'Cricket Australia upgrade you to a 12-month deal which is about $60,000 (£30,000), so after three games I told work I was leaving. I knew I was going to be paid well and the match payments on top are good at just over $4,500 (£2300).' Hemphrey immediately gave up his early morning job for Virgin at Brisbane Airport, co-ordinating their aircraft loads out on the ramps in sweltering heat. A fortnight later, in his fifth appearance for Queensland, he struck 118 on his adopted home ground. The celebratory removal of his helmet and glance to the heavens at reaching three figures an acknowledgement of his late Belgian grandfather Jim Charlier, who while not a cricket aficionado had witnessed his lowest ebb six years earlier when he made 163 for Kent seconds against MCC Young Cricketers. 'I am not really an extrovert, I keep my emotions fairly intact but what happened when I was released from Kent came back to me. A week after basically being told that I wasn't good enough my granddad came to watch and it was great afterwards listening to him talk about how I'd played from his non-cricket perspective,' Hemphrey explained. 'He passed away last year and so when I got to 100 I looked up and thought about him. I knew how proud he would have been. To me, scoring a first-class hundred in Australia is quite something but he taught me a lot about life, and I have to say I was a lot more nervous when I stood up to speak at his funeral than I was when I was on 97.' Although raised in Kent, Hemphrey was born in Doncaster and Geoffrey Boycott, arguably the greatest Yorkshire batsman of them all, would have doffed his cap at the price he places on his wicket. According to Hemphrey, a combination of leaving outside off-stump and playing the ball late is his modus operandi. 'The one thing I have learned over here is that the best time to bat is in the second half of the day, so getting through the first half has been important. Then I have cashed in.' Hemphrey's rise is all the more remarkable given that the three counties in his first incarnation as a cricketer were at least as interested in his off-spin (he has not bowled this past winter due to a labral tear in his shoulder). At Canterbury, it meant the presence of James Tredwell blocked his path. Although the three South Africans and two Pakistanis in a Kent side that made consecutive Twenty20 finals days in 2008 and 2009, when he held two summer contracts, were probably more to blame for his lack of opportunities. 'The club had other priorities, there was little focus on the second XI,' he says. In contrast, his performances were catching the eyes of Justin Sterns and Trevor Hohns - state coach and convenor of selectors respectively - not long after Australia Twenty20 international Chris Lynn, with whom a friendship developed during a previous three-year stint in Queensland grade cricket, lured him to Toombul. Naturally, there is a tinge of bitterness that his break has come on the other side of the globe: 'I just feel that you can't decide someone's career at the age of 19. It's too early. Different people develop at different rates. Look at Ryan Harris, Nathan Lyon, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen. Those four all hit their prime in their late twenties.' Not that he completely rules out a return: 'I don't want to close any doors. I am open to anything and at the end of the day cricket is a very short career in the grad scheme of things.' But for now he is running with the Bulls as English cricket's unsung export.","Charlie Hemphrey fulfilled an 'unrealistic dream' to become a first-class cricketer .

7810,"Sergio Perez fears 'a very painful year' lies ahead if Force India's roll out of their upgraded car this season proves a dud. Build-time pressure over the winter resulted in the Silverstone-based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace. The additional knock-on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team's B-spec model, which is now not due to be unveiled until the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.' For the team and the Mexican, who was 10th in the season-opening race in Australia - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in Malaysia recently, the current struggles are already tough to endure. Perez fears for Force India's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled McLaren duo of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in the Malaysia Grand Prix near the back of the grid . Perez finished 13th at Sepang and admits Force India are relying on their June upgrade to come good . 'It is frustrating knowing we don't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace. It's really hard,' Perez added. 'It is also really hard to keep motivated. Going into a race, knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage, is not the easiest for a driver. 'At the moment, on pure pace, it is quite difficult to make it into the points. We're quite far from the teams ahead of us. 'We are in a position where it's very easy to make mistakes, to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff. 'From now on we are going to have hard races, but it is what it is at the moment. We have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race. 'We're going to give 100 per cent and try to be there with whatever we have, to try to get into the points before we get the new package that can hopefully get us back into the points on pure pace.'","Sergio Perez admits Force India are relying on June upgrade to improve .

5543,"Philip Garrod, 43, was caught by a speed camera doing 105mph on his powerful Suzuki motorbike . A lying paramedic was struck off for faking a 999 emergency call-out to try and get off a driving ban after being caught speeding at 105mph on his motorbike. Philip Garrod, 43, was on his way to start a shift with the Welsh Ambulance Service when he was caught by a police camera doing the the eye-watering speed in a 60mph zone on his powerful Suzuki motorbike. He pleaded guilty and was fined £650 with six points for speeding  but then began weaving a web of lies after asking the judge to consider special circumstances to try and avoid a driving ban. At Dolgellau Magistrates Court, Garrod had claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau in north Wales. But the judge ordered an adjournment to take various witness statements before making a decision on his driving ban. That's when bosses began their own investigations and discovered the extent of Garrod's lies and opened a special misconduct hearing. Yesterday, the disciplinary hearing was told Garrod filled in a 'patient clinical record' for the bogus call to back up his false story. Garrod - a paramedic for ten years - was caught out when ambulance chiefs checked to find no record of the 999 call on the day of his speeding ticket. The panel heard the ambulance trust had no records of any 999 alert on the A470 at Dolgellau, North Wales, on 25 April 2011 - the day he was caught speeding. A report from the Health and Care Professionals Council said: 'The conduct was deliberate and was designed to mitigate the fact that he had been caught speeding. 'His actions were pre-meditated as he went as far as falsifying documentation to support his story. 'This would be deemed to be dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people.'

1490,"Britain's biggest purpose-built air raid shelter, which could hold 6,500 people, was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets. The tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the River Mersey in Stockport in the 1930s, and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces. But following the outbreak of the Second World War, the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of Lancashire and Cheshire could hide from Nazi bombs. Scroll down for video . Shelter: This shows one of the rooms of Britain's largest purpose-built air raid shelter, located in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Safe: A bunker lined with corrugated steel to protect against the possible effects of a Nazi bombing raid during the Second World War . Tunnels: A total of 6,500 people could fit into the shelter, which was made up of a network of interconnecting passages . Entrance: The shelter has been converted into a museum, replicating the conditions which would have been found 75 years ago . The shelter became so popular that local officials had to issue season tickets limiting the number of people who would be allowed to seek refuge there. The cliffs were first dug out to provide cellars for homes along Chestergate, one of the busiest streets in Stockport. As part of a plan to widen the roads, the local council bought and demolished the houses, and planned to convert the cellars into an underground car park. An engineering survey showed that the space was in fact unable to become a car park - but the advent of war meant that it was needed as an air raid shelter. Bathroom: The women's toilets, equipped with a proper flush, located deep inside the Stockport air raid shelter . Gadgets: A radio, blood pressure monitor and lamp from the 1940s, pictured inside the air raid shelter's first aid section . Medicine: The shelter had a first aid room to help any residents who were injured by the bombing raids . Equipment: Gas masks which were kept in the shelter are pictured left; right is the sick bay, where people could seek shelter while unwell . Extent: The shelter was going to be turned into a car park, but officials discovered that its long tunnels were unsuitable for the purpose . Curator Howard Green said: 'The official capacity was 3,850, so outside they painted 4,000 - but what they didn't advertise was that they thought they could squeeze twice as many in if needs be. 'They were used extensively by people from Manchester and Salford, and even as far as Eccles. Stockport was less of a target, and the underground shelters were a particularly safe place. 'What they did was introduce season tickets - they were issued to locals, although you could write in if you had difficult circumstances. We still have some letters from people in Manchester who'd been bombed out several times. 'It was really only a way of damping down demand, nobody was denied entrance in an alert. In the winter of 1940 and '41, it went up to 6,500, with another four sets of tunnel shelters. History: A photograph of the shelter as it appeared in the 1930s, around the time of the Second World War's outbreak . Rambling: The tunnels were large enough to fit in 6,500 people, who came from all around Lancashire, Cheshire and Manchester . Emergency: Local councils had to establish air raid shelters to protect their populations from German bomb attacks . Base: The room belonging to the shelter's warden, who would have been responsible for ensuring the safety of those inside . Danger: A fire bucket and hose which could have been used to control any unexpected blazes in the tunnels . 'People are always surprised by the extent of them, and just how much thought and planning went into them. There were first aid posts, electric lighting and flush toilets, which people living in back-to-back cottages of town centres wouldn't have had at home.' The shelter space is now operated as a museum, and has been restored to how it might have looked to residents hiding there during the war. Stockport was heavily bombed between 1940 and 1941, but escaped serious damage - unlike nearby Manchester, which as an industrial hub came under sustained attack from the German air force.","Air raid shelter in Stockport was dug out of caves along the River Mersey and intended to be a car park .

10243,"His primary job is to keep opposition strikers at bay, but that hasn't stopped John Terry from showing them the art of finishing too. The Chelsea captain scored his side's second goal in their 3-1 win away at Leicester on Wednesday night - as the Blues close in on their fourth Premier League title. The 34-year-old's close-range effort took his tally for the season to seven in all competitions - making him the club's joint third-highest goalscorer. John Terry was on hand to prod home from close range against Leicester on Wednesday night . Terry's strike at the King Power Stadium was his seventh goal in all competitions for Chelsea this season . Terry sits alongside strikers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba with seven goals apiece as well as attacking midfielder Oscar. Only star striker Diego Costa (20 goals) and PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard (18) have more for Jose Mourinho's side this campaign. The centre back's ability to score is a skill that compares him favourably to the firepower among other teams in and around the top seven of the table. At Manchester City, former Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard also has seven goals in all competitions this season - but Terry has fared better than forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic who have only found the back of the net six and five times respectively. On the other side of Manchester, much has been made of the malaise of on loan United striker Radamel Falcao. The 29-year-old has endured a tough season in England and this has been reflected by his poor tally of four goals in all competitions. Terry's goal return is better than Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko - who has six goals for the season . Radamel Falcao has endured a difficult season on loan at Manchester United - scoring only four goals . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) has scored only one more goal than Terry this season . Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli (left) and Tottenham's Roberto Soldado have both struggled in front of goal . Danny Welbeck, who left United for Arsenal last summer, hasn't fared much better too - having scored eight goals in all competitions for the Gunners. North London rivals Tottenham have relied heavily upon on the goals of Harry Kane and without his productivity Mauricio Pochettino would have had to call upon four-goal man Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor who has only scored twice. Liverpool's struggle for goals has been highlighted by the fact that Raheem Sterling has been deployed in attack by manager Brendan Rodgers this season. First-choice forward Daniel Sturridge has scored only five goals in a campaign which has been beset by injuries. Coupled with that, summer signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have failed to replace the void left by Luis Suarez - with the pair having scored four and three goals apiece. Terry's impressive goal return is even impressive when you look at the figures of Lambert's former club Southampton, where Saints forward Graziano Pelle (15) is their only player to have scored more than the former England international. The south coast club's next highest marksman is Sadio Mane with six then Shane Long with five. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle (left) has scored 15 goals in all competitions for the club this season . Chelsea's No 26 is vying with team-mate Branislav Ivanovic and United's Chris Smalling as this season's highest-scoring Premier League defender. The trio all have four goals in England's top-tier this season - three behind Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel's feat 12 months ago. Despite their impressive return, the triumvirate have a long way to go to match Julian Dicks' record.

9291,"I am not vain, rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery, when my mother rang for her weekly chat and I was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle, I probed her for beauty advice. If I was feeling old, she, with a nearly 40-year-old daughter, must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great. At 65, she could easily pass for ten years younger. Scroll down for video . Sarah's face was transformed after the exercises. She's pictured before (left) and after (right) 'I thank my genes, the fact I've never tried a cigarette and the facial stretches I've been doing for 30 years,' she said. Ah, those. I remember my mum slathered in Vaseline, gurning in a Club Sport tracksuit while I ate my Coco Pops, invariably wearing the Deely Bobbers I insisted on sleeping in between 1983 and 85. So they worked? My mother swore they did. Facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty, with some claiming Cleopatra was the first celebrity fan. The first official guide, however, was published in Paris in 1710, outlining the beauty routine of Ninon de L'Enclose, a courtesan famed for her lasting beauty. Nearly two centuries later, Sanford Bennett - a notoriously wrinkle-free San Franciscan 70-year-old - released his book, Exercising In Bed, which gave away his facial secrets. From then on, facial exercisers came thick and fast. Jack LaLanne, the funny Hollywood guy permanently in tight Lycra was the visage visionary of the Fifties, right up to the Eighties. Today, however, the go-to expert is Carole Maggio, the LA-based creator of Facercise, with a celebrity and royalty-packed client list. The Furrow Smoother . This involves spreading my fingers across the centre of my forehead, then pulling my fingertips down while pushing my brows up so I look very confused. I had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling. The Furrow Smoother involves spreading the fingers across the centre of the forehead for 30 seconds . Sarah pulls her fingertips down while pushing her brows up to work her forehead muscles . The Lip Lift . This is an exercise which requires a Joker smile that moves up and down an inch using visualisation. 'Imagine a plumber bent over in low-slung Levi's,' Maggio encourages. 'Now move your mouth to express that - ew - and hold it.' Maggio encourages exercises to form an 'ew' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips . The Nose Transformer . This isn't pretty either. It requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40. All of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so I can see that I resemble a tired-looking Miss Piggy with a hangover. But I feel the burn. The burn! The burn that means it's working! The next day, after my first facial workout, I wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after I took my first spin class in 2004, but I push on with my exercises. The Nose Transformer was so tough that Sarah's face muscles were still and sore the next day . 'After six days of doing her exercises twice a day, I could see significant improvement,' a gorgeous gal pal, also in her 50s, told me. Her nickname is Maggio the Magician and I needed her to work her magic on my ageing face. Luckily, her books and DVDs are available on Amazon and ship within days. Carole's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do: sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm. She also advises drinking more water and eating more protein. These things instantly help everyone's appearance as they get older, apparently. The DVD and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that Carole promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin. So. Now my new gym routine is less about getting sweaty in Lycra and more about sitting in front of a mirror pulling a series of scary, exaggerated expressions, working my 57 facial muscles while sitting with my butt clenched and back straight. I work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than I thought it would. I am a sit-down-with-a-cheese-sandwich-and-a-Jane-Austen-novel kind of girl rather than a natural gym bunny, but even I'm shocked my face aches this much. I am feeling the desired burn in places I never knew I had. Facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference, and I feel a bit more plumped up; more ruddy farmer's wife than aging, old crone. My upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life I feel bee-stung enough to try red lipstick. Do I look younger? I'd say so. Fresher? Indeed. Perhaps face exercise really are the key to facing forward? www.facercise.com .","Sarah Ivens, 39, tries the 'furrow smoother', 'lip lift' and 'nose transformer'

6437,"There will be a white-hot atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Saturday afternoon when Aston Villa come to town but Tim Sherwood has got to keep his emotions in check. This is about what happens on the pitch, not the touchline. The Villa boss is a passionate man but he can’t afford to let things get personal. He did a good job at Tottenham — he’s never afraid to talk about having the best Premier League win percentage of any Spurs boss  — but was still not trusted with the job long-term. That will hurt. He was in charge of the youth set-up for years and the club are now reaping the rewards with a team full of academy players, but he is more than just a company man. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood returns to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham this weekend . When he was finally given a shot at the top job his personality came flooding through. Incredibly driven and extremely confident, he did not take long to make a mark but it was an uneasy relationship and did not last long. That was a shame, because he is talented and I like to see as many former players as possible in managerial roles. There is so much knowledge to harness. At Aston Villa, he has set the emotional bar high but it’s working. Villa were lacking confidence all season and it looked like they lacked the ambition to win games. Sherwood’s intensity has sparked them back to life. He has revived Christian Benteke in the same way as he did for Emmanuel Adebayor last season. Sherwood clearly targets players he feels can make the biggest impact and sets to work. Sherwood lets his feelings be known as he celebrates a goal at Villa Park against Queens Park Rangers . Sherwood launches his jacket to the ground in celebration after Aston Villa pulled level against QPR . Sherwood grimaces as the Villa mascot - wearing the famous Tim Sherwood gilet - embraces him . The big Belgian has seven goals in five games and looks a top player again. He was not affecting games but now his team-mates find him early. There’s nothing wrong with being direct and Benteke is a beast when you get him on the ball. Sherwood is still searching for a balance in midfield but he has given Charles N’Zogbia a chance and still has an eye on youth with talent such as Jack Grealish coming through. Sherwood’s emotional style can be great for a player — his antics on the touchline prove how much it means to him — but it has its drawbacks. He is never afraid to tell his players what he thinks of them. That encourages some but footballers can be sensitive souls. The Villa squad won’t like being called ‘icing-on-the-cake players’ and I’m sure a few at Tottenham will remember being told they ‘lack character’ and ‘are too nice’. Sherwood certainly knew how to get the best out of Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor . Big Belgian international Christian Benteke is another striker enjoying working under Sherwood . When I was at Arsenal and George Graham came back to the club as Leeds boss, there was an extra determination to beat him. I expect Spurs to be exactly the same with Sherwood. There’s no doubt he’s talented but he has to be careful not to let his emotions get the better of him. Les Ferdinand told me when they worked together at Spurs, Tim needed a calming influence alongside him, as long as it was a peer he could respect. Les was the perfect foil. Don’t be surprised if Sherwood appoints someone like Ferdinand at Villa. It will be interesting to see what kind of reception Sherwood gets on Saturday. But with Villa staring at a relegation battle this is not about unfinished business or gilet throwing. This is about the result. That’s why Tim has to keep his cool. Sherwood shouts at his players as they look to earn an important victory at home to QPR .

Sherwood may look to find a calming influence at Villa, which Les Ferdinand could provide, and his appointment to the club would be interesting.

The article also highlights Sherwood's past tenure at Tottenham and his ability to get the best out of players, but also notes that his emotional style has its drawbacks, as footballers can be sensitive. Finally, the author suggests that Sherwood may need a calming influence at Villa, similar to the role that Les Ferdinand played at Tottenham."

1366,"Patients are being put at risk because paramedics are leaving firemen to deal with 999 calls, healthcare leaders warn. Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid – yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator – to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training – and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own – to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firemen – said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched.","The Fire Brigades Union say practice is irresponsible and dangerous .

696,"Rome (CNN)A destination for the destitute, Sicily is the ""promised land"" for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast. More than 10,000 people have arrived from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between North Africa and Italy; boat people have been arriving on Italy's islands for more than a decade. But what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation, specifically those in Libya, because when Moammar Gadhafi was in control, he also controlled the flow of migrant ships. In 2008, the-then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi  signed an historic friendship agreement in which Italy promised to invest $5 billion in Libyan infrastructure and Gadhafi promised to close what he described as a ""spigot"" of migrants. During a three-day state visit to Italy in August 2010, he famously threatened to ""turn Europe black"" if Libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the European Union. After the agreement, Gadhafi  kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased. For a time, almost all migrant arrivals came from Tunisia, just 70 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because Italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to Tunisia, the flow eventually tapered off. And once a new Tunisian government was in place, after the Arab Spring, Italy signed an accord with Tunisia in which they promised to help patrol Tunisia's ports. But after Gadhafi was overthrown, the flow of migrants from Libya exploded again: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Rome told CNN that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the North Africa coast in 2011. In October 2013, after a tragic boat accident off the coast of Lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died, trapped like sardines in their smugglers' boat as it sank, Italy decided it had to act. In November of 2013, the Italian Navy launched a €9M-a-month search-and-rescue program called Mare Nostrum, in which Italian naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants. In just one year, the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants, according to the Italian Navy. Due to budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean, the mission ended in October 2014. By the end of the year, more than 174,000 people had been rescued in Italy; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey, according to the IOM. In November last year, the European Union's border control, Frontex, started its own mission -- Triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend them ships; a ship from Iceland, at the far north of the continent, is currently involved in Frontex's operations off southern Europe. When Italy ended Mare Nostrum, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned that some European governments were making ""keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards."" ""This is a mistake, and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars,"" Guterres told a UNHCR policy meeting. ""Security and immigration management are concerns for any country, but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage."" Once migrants arrive in Italy, they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied, but Italy has been sanctioned by the European Union for not fingerprinting new arrivals. By law, Italy has to take care of the arrivals, but many have no intention of staying in the country, and few of the reception centers are gated, meaning migrants can come and go as they please. And with no physical border controls between Italy and other European countries, they can then disperse across the continent. Moutassem Yazbek, 27, an IT specialist who worked for six years in Dubai, arrived in Sicily in December on board a smuggler's boat. He told CNN he was never fingerprinted in Italy, and eventually made it to Germany where he is studying to learn the language and find work. He says the human trafficking network is a finely-oiled machine that fills a growing need. ""I would have done anything to get here,"" Yazbek said. ""It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear. Hard as that may be to believe, it is a better life.""","Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees risk the perilous journey across the Mediterranean every year .
Many make the trip in dangerous boats owned by people smugglers; thousands have died along the way in recent years .",a4a8d10287cdb0d1fab6cd877de42e16983351ca,cnndm,"The current surge in the number of migrants arriving in Italy from North Africa is due to a lack of control at the ports of embarkation in Libya, which had been previously controlled by Colonel Gadhafi. The former Libyan authorities agreed in 2008 to reduce the flow of migrants in exchange for investment in its infrastructure by the then Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi. With the flow of migrants again on the rise, Mare Nostrum, Italy's €9m-per month search-and-rescue program for migrants,  ended in October 2014, following criticism from the European Union (EU), and was replaced by the €3m-per-month EU border patrol, Triton. This move led the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, warn that some European governments were making ""keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards.""

591,"(CNN)A new Kansas law banning a common second-term abortion procedure is the first of its kind in the United States. The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as ""dismemberment abortion"" and defines as ""knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus."" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if ""necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,"" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law ""protecting life at its most vulnerable stage."" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of ""extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability."" ""Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,"" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes ""will be many state laws."" ""This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,"" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. ""This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,"" she said. ""We'll continue to fight!""

4317,"Multiple ghosts supposedly inhabit an expensive New York City apartment building, which recently added Academy Award-nominated actress Jessica Chastain to its list of occupants. Two residents from the Osborne Apartments on West 57th Street in Manhattan told the New York Post of their experiences with spirits in the building. Chastain and her boyfriend, Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, spent $5.1 million on an apartment that features four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, Daily Mail Online reported early last month. Chastain most recently appeared on the big screen in the 2014 films Interstellar and A Most Violent Year. Purchase: Jessica Chastain recently purchased a $5.1 million apartment at The Osborne.

The Osborne is located close to Carnegie Hall and is a few blocks away from Columbus Circle, Central Park and Lincoln Center. One of The Osborne's longtime residents, Naomi Guffman, recently told the Post 'I have a poltergeist!' She thinks the ghost is actually one of the apartment's former tenants, Metropolitan Opera singer Johanna Gadski, according to the newspaper. The Post described Gadski as 'a red-haired practical joker' who was killed in a 1932 Berlin car accident. Guffman told the Post '[Me and my husband would] be standing in the hallway talking and the toilet would start to flush.' She also described doors randomly opening and water on the stove boiling of its own accord.

Classic: The apartment also features lots of wood paneling and design elements . Macabre: Ghosts supposedly inhabit The Osborne, according to some of its residents .

The couple earlier placed a broom close by and were already aware of ghost speculation, according to the Post. The newspaper reported that the Osborne Apartments are allegedly haunted by architect Alfredo Taylor's ghost as he takes the elevator and walks around hallways. Taylor came up with the plan for the building's 1906 addition. Taylor is also known for being the architect behind multiple buildings in Norfolk, Connecticut.

8737,"REJECTION PROOF . by Jia Jiang . (Random House, £13.99) Who likes rejection? Whether you are being rejected by a lover, an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you, it’s galling. And in every case there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing that doesn’t carry a long prison sentence, anyway. It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis, and Jia Jiang is both of those. Born into a family of teachers, Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that, as a child in China, he dug a hole in the garden, intending to reach America by the shortest route. He eventually made the journey by conventional means, and found a good life there. Wife, children, several degrees, job in middle management. But he wasn’t happy. He wanted to take risks, start his own company. It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there’s nothing we can do about it (picture posed by model) The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection, mainly from potential backers for his project (another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want). And each time, rejection felt like the end of the world. A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this. So, having possibly read one self-help book too many, Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection-proofing quest. Instead of avoiding rejection, he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected, film them and put them up on his blog. All of which seemed to me, at first glance, rather artificial. There have been any number of ‘quest’ books, in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge, for example, less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it. But Jia Jiang isn’t a humorous writer. He may adopt a light-hearted tone, but his quest was deadly serious. On day one, he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $100. The security guard said no, and Jia almost broke into a run to get away. Watching the video later, he said he looked like the man in Munch’s The Scream. On day two, he went into a burger joint and, noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘Free refill’, asked the cashier for a burger refill. The cashier said no. But as he continued his quest, Jia realised there were ways and ways of asking. Show confidence, inject a little bit of humour, be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want, but you might get something. So he walked into Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts, interlocking in the manner of the Olympic symbol. The woman behind the counter looked thoughtful. ‘When are you looking for these?’ she asked. ‘In the next . . . 15 minutes?’ ‘Let me see what I can do,’ she said. And did it. You can see what happened next on YouTube. And so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations. People confuse it with failure, but rejection is personal, and we take it personally. The crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it’s how we respond to it that matters. Jia Jiang’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound: rejection is only someone else’s opinion, and it may not be the right one.","It doesn't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected .

He filmed these encounters and shared them on his blog, ultimately learning ways to approach rejection with greater confidence and humor, and even negotiating to get some of what he wanted. Jiang argues that people confuse rejection with failure, but that success depends on how individuals respond to rejection. Despite his extreme positivity, Jiang's message is that rejection is only one person's opinion and may not be the right one."

8183,"At first glance, the rest of our solar system seems to be a pretty barren place - pockmarked worlds with dry surfaces are abundant, and only one - Earth - has visible water. But by peering beneath the surfaces of other worlds, scientists are quickly realising that water may actually be much more commonplace than thought. Nine other worlds in total are now suspected to have some form of subsurface ocean containing far more water than is on Earth - and some may even contain life, according to Nasa. Nasa has released an infographic explaining which worlds in the solar system are thought to have oceans under their surface, such as Ceres, seen here. The distance from the sun is given in AU, which stands for Astronomical Unit - and one AU is the distance from Earth to the sun . The agency released an infographic detailing the various worlds of our solar system suspected to have subsurface oceans. It followed claims by Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for the agency, that we could find life in the next ten or 20 years. ‘Nasa science activities have provided a wave of amazing findings related to water in recent years that inspire us to continue investigating our origins and the fascinating possibilities for other worlds, and life, in the universe,’ she said. ‘In our lifetime, we may very well finally answer whether we are alone in the solar system and beyond.’ There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy - and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington this week, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Dr Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Dr Jeffrey Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Dr Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' Water is important because life, as we know it, needs it to survive. Some may say that there could be other forms of life that don’t need water - but as we don’t know of any yet, it makes sense to look for wet environments to discover if we are alone or not. ‘As Nasa missions explore our solar system and search for new worlds, they are finding water in surprising places,’ the agency said in a statement. ‘Water is but one piece of our search for habitable planets and life beyond Earth, yet it links many seemingly unrelated worlds in surprising ways.’ The chemical elements in water, hydrogen and oxygen, are some of the most abundant elements in the universe. The signature of water can be seen in the giant molecular clouds between stars, or in disks of material in young planetary systems. In our solar system the gas giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - are thought to contains lots of water in their atmospheres. But it is the solid moons and dwarf planets that are of more interest. For example, scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. Signs of an underground ocean on Europa can be seen in the lines that are strewn across its surface. A nasa mission next decade will seek to search for water emanating from Europa - and see if its oceans are habitable. Ganymede, meanwhile, has layers of water and ice below its surface . Scientists using Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. The water forms because the moon is pushed and pulled by the gas giant Jupiter . Here the lines across Europa's surface can be seen, likely caused by the icy surface cracking due to the motion of water underground . On its surface, Callisto is a barren world covered in craters, but underground it might also have an underground ocean. Meanwhile, geysers of water have been seen shooting from Enceladus . Water on worlds like Ganymede forms through tidal heating; its orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular, so it is pushed and pulled by the planet’s gravity, melting ice beneath its surface. Saturn’s moons Europa and Enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface, in contact with mineral-rich rock, and may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it. These are liquid water, essential chemical elements for biological processes and sources of energy that could be used by living things. Nasa's Cassini mission has also revealed Enceladus as an active world of icy geysers. Recent research suggests it may have hydrothermal activity on its ocean floor, an environment potentially suitable for living organisms. Signs of water have also been spotted in craters on Mercury, while it appears that Mars was at least once wet - and may still have occasional brief rivers of water on its surface. The dwarf planet Ceres, between Earth and Jupiter, may also have some water-ice on its surface - and water underground. Nasa’s Dawn spacecraft, which recently arrived in orbit, will hopefully reveal how wet this world is. Titan could have lakes of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface, but may also have an ocean of water underground - although its unlikely to support life. Mimas, meanwhile, often compared to the Death Star from Star Wars owing to its huge crater, could possibly harbor life . Jets of material are seen shooting from Enceladus here, as pictured by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. Exactly how these jets form or what they are made of, however, is not clear . Nasa recently announced that it is now thought Mars once had more water than the Arctic Ocean on Earth, shown in this illustration. Almost of this water has gone today, leaving the world barren and dry . Towards the outer reaches of the solar system, even Neptune's moon Triton and the dwarf planet Pluto may have some sort of ocean hiding under their surfaces . Other moons including Callisto, Titan, Mimas and Triton are also thought to have underground oceans, while Pluto at the edge of the solar system may, too, be equally wet. And if these worlds are proven to have water, it stands to reason that others outside the solar system may also have oceans, either underground or on their surface. Missions like the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) - scheduled to launch in 2017 - will such nearby, bright stars for Earth-sized worlds, some of which may have water. And Nasa’s next great space observatory meanwhile, the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2019, will examine the atmospheres of certain worlds in detail. ‘It's easy to forget that the story of Earth's water, from gentle rains to raging rivers, is intimately connected to the larger story of our solar system and beyond,’ Nasa said in a statement. ‘But our water came from somewhere - every world in our solar system got its water from the same shared source. ‘So it's worth considering that the next glass of water you drink could easily have been part of a comet, or an ocean moon, or a long-vanished sea on the surface of Mars. ‘And note that the night sky may be full of exoplanets formed by similar processes to our home world, where gentle waves wash against the shores of alien seas.’","Nasa scientists in California say our solar system is full of water .

2970,"FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce claimed on Wednesday night that the SFA were ‘entirely wrong’ in their move to ban Josh Meekings from the Scottish Cup Final. The Inverness Caley Thistle centre-half will learn on Thursday whether he has been successful in challenging the one-match suspension offered by compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a Leigh Griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted Celtic to write to the SFA seeking ‘an understanding’ of why no penalty and red card followed. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday . Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off . But Northern Irishman Boyce, who is also chairman of FIFA’s referees committee, believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee Steven McLean and his assistants. ‘This sets a very dangerous precedent, I am absolutely, 100 per cent against the compliance officer becoming involved because the referee’s decision is final,’ said Boyce. ‘It is a totally different matter if someone has gone over the top, or committed a serious foul, or head-butted someone and the referee has missed it. ‘Those are disciplinary issues. But what happened here is that the referee has made a mistake regarding a hand-ball and that’s the end of it. There is no way the player should now be disciplined for that. ‘Who is to say it was even intentional? If the Scottish FA or their referees committee decide that they feel a serious mistake was made then they could take action in the future against that referee. ‘The only punishment, if any punishment at all is due, should be made if the Scottish FA feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision.’ FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final . The SFA’s disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending-off offences not seen by the referee, including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity. And former compliance officer Vincent Lunny believes Meekings should brace himself to miss the showpiece against Falkirk on May 30. ‘Look at the different options — any way you look at it, he would have missed the final,’ said Lunny. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final . ‘I suppose it’s natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the Scottish Cup Final, which might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. ‘But if Steven McLean had seen it at the time, he’d have been sent off and he’d be missing the final had Inverness gone on to win; and if he (Meekings) hadn’t done it, Celtic would have scored and there’s a good chance they would have gone on to win, so again Josh Meekings would have missed the final. ‘I think it will be an uphill struggle, especially after (Inverness manager) John Hughes’s comments on the radio saying it was a sending-off matter.’","Josh Meekings was given a retrospective one-match ban for a handball .

9654,"PC Ronnie Lungu has won a race discrimination case against Wiltshire Police . A black police constable has won a race discrimination case against his force after they did not promote him due to the colour of his skin. Ronnie Lungu was singled out as 'a marked man' by Wiltshire Police solely due to his race, the employment tribunal ruled. It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable in 2003 after moving to England and 10 years later was temporarily promoted to the role of sergeant. After passing his sergeant's exam he applied for the role permanently, but he was turned down. Employment judges were told he was the only black candidate out of 20 officers to go for the position. The panel found that his internal assessments were specifically downgraded in order to make him appear unworthy of promotion. It also was told that a senior member of staff were invited to make negative comments about PC Lungu during an appraisal. The tribunal concluded that Wiltshire Police had singled out Mr Lungu as a 'marked man' on grounds of his race . The judgment read: 'The reduction in the scoring has the very significant effect in terms of making it appear reasonable that the one black applicant for promotion was scoring lower than the 19 white applicants and should therefore not be promoted.' It went on: 'This behaviour is so extreme that the Tribunal cannot think of any apparent motive other than one that is directly related to [the] Claimant's race.' Despite his treatment, Mr. Lungu is still serving as a PC with the force. 'I joined the force to uphold the law and I still would like to remain with the force,' he said. 'I need reassurance from Wiltshire Police that they will take issues of discrimination seriously in future and I want to see new procedures put in place to tackle discrimination and better education among senior members of staff in how to deal with complaints.' Mr Lungu said he was left 'upset' and 'angry' after being penalised because he was black . His lawyer, Juliette Franklin, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'It's extremely disappointing that people are facing this sort of prejudice and discrimination. 'Wiltshire Police needs to take this tribunal ruling very seriously and take swift steps to address any failings which have been identified. 'The force needs to ensure that officers feel confident that if they experience racism or discrimination that any complaint will be taken seriously.' Wiltshire Chief Constable Patrick Geenty said the force was 'concerned' by the findings and would 'learn lessons' from the case. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Patrick Geenty, pictured, said he was 'concerned' by the findings . He said: 'Wiltshire Police take this matter very seriously and I am concerned by the Tribunal's findings. Clearly, the issues this raises do need to be carefully considered. 'We continue to work hard to embed our values and behaviours and the Code of Ethics within the organisation. 'Wiltshire Police will learn lessons from this process and continue to move forward.' He added: 'As an organisation we have a very small number of Black and Ethnic Minority (BME) staff (16 officers, 15 police staff and 3 Police Special Constables) and this judgment raises some serious concerns about how an officer felt he was treated. 'I have no doubt that this judgment will affect members of the Black and Ethnic Minority community who might be considering joining Wiltshire Police. 'I want to reassure the public that Wiltshire Police are committed to increasing diversity in the Force so that we can reflect the communities we serve. 'This case was complex and there were a number of points covered. With our legal advisors, we are undertaking an assessment of the Tribunal's findings in order to decide whether to appeal any aspects of the judgment. 'Following this assessment, decisions will be made on what action we may need to take and how we can ensure that lessons are learnt from this case. 'We will continue to engage with the officer and his representatives to ensure that he can continue to be a valued member of Wiltshire Police. 'All necessary training and support will continue to be provided to him.'","Ronnie Lungu successfully sued Wiltshire Police for race discrimination .

1525,"Flanked by Johnny Russell and Will Hughes, Eric Steele jigged over to the travelling Derby supporters - the popular goalkeeping coach was in the mood to celebrate. After a first win in eight, they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six-week wobble is no longer. Steele lapped up the adulation, entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the DW Stadium at which the Rams wrapped up three crucial points. This felt very important indeed, the outpouring of each olé obvious. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half . Steve McClaren was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game . Wigan (4-4-2): Al Habsi; Boyce (McCann 63), Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Bo-kyung, Kvist, Perch McClean; Clarke (Waghorn 75), Fortune (Murphy 65). Subs not used: Carson, Pennant, Barnett, Ojo. Booked: Boyce, Clarke . Derby (4-2-3-1): Grant; Keogh, Forsyth, Albentosa, Warnock (Christie 88); Hughes, Hendrick, Ward (Martin 46), Russell, Ince (Dawkins 90); Bent. Subs not used: Roos, Lingard, Whitbread, Hanson. Goals: Martin 51, Bent 81. Booked: Hughes, Hendrick. Referee: S. Hooper. Attendance: 14,697. Make no mistake, these have been tough times for Steve McClaren. Top of the tree back on February 24, the Derby manager is now only looking at promotion via the play-offs, labelling an automatic spot a ‘long shot’. Their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked, but goals from substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent mean they are back on track. Martin climbed off the bench at half-time to change the game, slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before Bent capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second. ‘I didn’t think Chris would make the impact that he did,’ McClaren admitted after Martin’s first appearance in almost two months. ‘He could only play 45 minutes. ‘It’s a massive win. Huge character. We showed the quality we’ve been missing. The away following was absolutely incredible. We’ve stuck together.’ Wigan, by contrast, are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003. Now eight points adrift, their fans chanted for the head of Malky Mackay. Chairman David Sharpe didn’t know where to look at full-time and they need two wins from trips to Fulham and Millwall - on Friday and next Tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant does well to tip over a header from a Wigan corner . Derby winger Tom Ince has a low effort saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi . Jeff Hendrick rides a challenge from South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung . ‘It’s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we’ve got,’ Mackay said. ‘It was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season. ‘I thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box. That should bring a return of two goals.’ It did not, and Mackay’s use of ‘mathematical’ tends to suggest the writing is on the wall. James McClean and Kim Bo-kyung both went close but Wigan ran out of steam, their fans streaming out after Bent’s 81st-minute clincher. Kim shifted the ball to his left foot and found James McClean, storming towards the six-yard box but the winger’s bullet header was met in stature by Lee Grant’s splendid one-handed stop, tipping over while airborne. Tom Ince had the beating of his man inside the box, but could only fluff right-footed straight at Ali Al Habsi. Maguire almost put through his own net from a Jamie Ward corner but those two moments were all McClaren’s side could muster before the break, finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the DW Stadium quite a deterrent. This had been used for the Warriors’ win against St Helens in their Rugby League encounter on Good Friday, and you could tell; a tame Kim drive bobbled three times to test Grant when otherwise it would not have. But, frankly, that is the least of Wigan’s worries. They face an almighty task to escape relegation, made all the harder when Martin linked up with Russell to score. ‘The difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do,’ Mackay rued. Chris Martin celebrates after giving Derby the lead in the crucial promotion clash . Grant saves at the feet of Leon Clarke as relegation-threatened Wigan press for a second-half equaliser . It’s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the Scotland international’s presence. He came on with purpose, knocked the normally immovable Maguire from pillar to post and gave the Rams a focus. Ince just poked over the bar after super build-up involving Martin and Bent, before the on-loan Aston Villa striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes. Bent comes alive in the 18-yard box and reacted quickest to Jason Pearce’s terrible mix-up to add a second. Wigan did have their chances. McClean was smothered brilliantly by Grant as the Ireland international looked to equalise; William Kvist then saw a half-volley superbly blocked by Hughes. They displayed guts, but not an awful lot of quality, and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by Dave Whelan in controversially appointing Mackay. ‘We want Malky out,’ was the summation of 10,000 home fans. Five wins since taking over in November suggests they are right. Substitute Darren Bent puts the result beyond doubt by finishing from close range .

3652,"The records are tumbling and Leicester’s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .","Leicester have recorded three consecutive Premier League wins .

There have been no significant changes to affect results, instead, striker Leonardo Ulloa is taking more chances, whilst Esteban Cambiasso is adding high quality to their midfield and Kasper Schmeichel returned at peak form for this crucial period. The team is fresh, thanks to changes in personnel, being able to call on a mainly full-strength squad most weeks, with manager Nigel Pearson confident in his tactics and ability to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality.
","Leicester City is experiencing a remarkable recovery and has won three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since 2000. Underlying the resurgence are certain keythemes, like scoring surge, Cambiasso class, Schmeichel sensational, adept at adapting, Pearson's strength, and building belief. The team's recent success can be traced to consistent and sound application of principles that kept things steady, even during a five-month spell at the bottom of the league. With home comfort being an important factor, Leicester City players, fans, and manager believe they can win their battle against relegation."
8127,"DOWNTON'S EXIT . We were told by Mooresey [coach Peter Moores] that Paul had been let go between sessions in the practice game against Saint Kitts. I think Mooresey had only just found out himself. You see it when football clubs get taken over; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions. Paul was a lovely guy and I feel sorry he’s lost his job but when you get new people in, changes always happen. There have been a few names bandied around and I think Straussy [Andrew Strauss] was considered last time the role came up a year ago, but he didn’t particularly fancy it. He’s certainly a very good man, but it’s hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is. But Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart are all former England captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role. Stuart Broad admits he was sorry to see Paul Downton leave his role in the ECB . Downton (centre) was sacked as ECB managing director after a dismal World Cup this year . ALASTAIR COOK . He seems in a really happy place and excited to be back around the group. He’d be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm-up game but I’d back him to score big runs in this series — he looks refreshed and ready to go. PLAYER POWER . It’s incredibly important that all the players feel they can contribute and speak up when they need to. That can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that. I did an Adidas event with Harlequins winger Ugo Monye and he was saying how player-led they were at the club. During the World Cup we didn’t talk enough as players and the guys weren’t speaking up as much as they needed to. We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty [Jonathan Trott] back into the group will help that. Broad has backed Alastair Cook to score big runs during the series in the Caribbean . Captain Cook scored a century during a warm-up game against St Kitts & Nevis . RICHIE BENAUD . I used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986-87 Ashes series and I’ll always remember Richie’s commentary on that. He had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to. I don’t think there’ll be anyone in the cricket world who won’t be touched by his passing. His voice symbolised cricket and we’ll all miss him. JIMMY ANDERSON . He’s one of my best mates and we’ve played a lot of cricket together. He’s taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career. I think we’re third behind Waqar [Younis] and Wasim [Akram] and Curtly [Ambrose] and Courtney [Walsh] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other’s styles and constant communication. It would a phenomenal achievement for him to become England’s leading wicket taker. Broad says that he and Jimmy Anderson are best mates and admits he has guided him through his career . Broad says it will be a great achievement for Jimmy Anderson to become England's leading wicket taker . FITNESS . Twisting my ankle in the warm-up game was a bit of a scare, but it feels fine now. There was a burning feeling for a minute or so after it happened and I was pretty worried. It’s still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be OK. ANTIGUA TRACK . They’re generally pretty flat out here now and I think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit. We’ve been practising our slip catching low down by our ankles because we’re not expecting a lot of carry. I think the team that wins the series will be the one that shows most patience and gets the best out of reverse swing.

4749,"Imminent arrival: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with Prince George . They could have been any mother and child. The pony-tailed young woman sitting on a hay bale at a petting zoo with her little boy perched on her knee wore barely a trace of make-up. The only giveaway that she was someone special was the diamond and sapphire ring sparkling on her left hand. While some other mothers nudged one another in disbelief as Kate and Prince George cooed over the new-born animals, staff at Snettisham Farm Park, Norfolk, are so familiar with the Duchess of Cambridge she knows many on first-name terms. Helped by his mother, her prominent bump hidden beneath what appeared to be William’s green Barbour coat, Prince George tenderly gave a bottle of milk to one of the farm’s new-born piglets. If it seems to be a picture of a typical middle-class day out, that is no accident as this is exactly the informal, away-from-the-cameras upbringing William and Kate want for their children. That is why they are turning their new country bolt hole, Anmer Hall, on the North Norfolk coast, into a secluded fortress home, far from prying eyes – and far removed from traditional Royal protocol. Anmer is set to become their principal residence over the next few years as William focuses on family and his new flying career. For him, a life of peace and quiet is far preferable to his own pressure-cooker upbringing under the global spotlight. Royal aides have confirmed that the Cambridges will head to Anmer after the birth (they will spend the first night at Kensington Palace) – as will Kate’s mother, Carole, to help with childcare and housekeeping. Kate will be taking a longer maternity leave this time round and The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the pilot Prince plans to scale back his black-tie charity commitments so that he can enjoy more time at home. ‘His focus for the next two years is on family and flying in that order,’ a close friend revealed. Already the couple have immersed themselves in a notably more domestic – not to say middle class – life style than many Royals, with under-the-radar shopping trips to nearby market towns and evening dinners in country pubs. A noticeable part of the mother-and-child day out at Snettisham was the absence of fuss and preferential treatment. The Duchess’s security detail, stationed a respectful 50 yards away, left Kate and George to enjoy their morning in peace. It was a sunny Monday earlier this month, just days after the couple finally moved into Anmer Hall. And Kate and George were enjoying one of their last days out together before the arrival of the new Royal baby. Scroll down for video . Family home: William has created a secluded retreat for Kate, George and their new arrival at Anmer Hall, in North Norfolk . According to one farm source: ‘Kate comes here a lot with George. She is absolutely lovely and George is delightful. There is never a fuss when she’s here. ‘If she wasn’t pointed out to you, you wouldn’t know she was here. She goes about her business like any other young mum and dotes on her child. Little George is lovely, extraordinarily social and other children seem to fuss over him. They have no idea who he is.’ According to a close friend of Kate’s: ‘She can’t wait to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Both she and William love the country and it’s where they want to raise their family.’ It’s not hard to see why they want to escape the confines of Apartment 1A, Kensington Palace, their official residence. Fiercely private, the Cambridges are faced with the problem of being both public figures and private people. William has a complicated relationship with the media, dating back to his mother’s tragic death. He despises the paparazzi and has threatened legal action against any individuals taking unofficial photographs of his family. Pregnant Kate and young Prince George have enjoyed meeting the new-born animals at Snettisham Park Farm . Prince George and his mother are also regular visitors to the children’s play area at a nearby village . As a result, Prince George is rarely photographed in public and has not made an official appearance in this country since leaving St Mary’s hospital 21 months ago. This is no mistake. It is part of William’s strategy to shelter his family and he has a team of qualified aides and lawyers to advise him on privacy laws. Of course, William and Kate are also keen to enjoy the fruits of their two-year £1.5 million remodelling of their new home, with its ten bedrooms, swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. Their official residence will remain Kensington Palace, but Anmer Hall will be their de facto family home for at least the next two years as William embarks on a new career with the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service. As part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof, a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory – William had the driveway to the property, which used to belong to his close friends the Van Cutsem family, rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees. Security is paramount and the outhouses have been converted into dwellings for the couple’s security staff. At Anmer Hall, Prince George can enjoy playing in the garden and William can cycle freely around the country lanes. Kate loves shopping in the locals villages of Burnham Market, Holt and Holkham and locals often see her playing with George at a play area in a nearby village. Moving to Anmer has afforded the couple the peace and freedom William especially has always craved. The tiny hamlet where they live is so small there isn’t even a pub, just a social club where the couple sometimes mingle with locals at its film nights. The residents of the blue-doored cottages, part of the Sandringham estate, are fiercely protective of their new neighbours. Remember, too, that some of William’s happiest childhood memories are of when his mother ripped up the stuffy Royal protocols and introduced her two young sons to ‘normal’ life by taking them to theme parks, go-kart tracks and public beaches – trips echoed by Kate and George’s visit to the petting zoo. The Duchess of Cambridge enjoys shopping in picturesque North Norfolk villages such as Holt (pictured) Friends say they are considering sending Prince George to a local nursery or playschool. While a Royal aide says it is ‘a bit premature’, the couple will soon have to think about the option for their son. The couple have already become central to the elite group of aristocratic locals known as the ‘Turnip Toffs’. Prince George’s godfather William Van Cutsem and his wife Rosie live in Hilborough, 40 minutes away, while the Duke’s old friends the Duckworth-Chad family live at Pynkney Hall near King’s Lynn. William’s friend, Etonian Archie Soames is often at the family seat, West Barsham Hall in Fakenham, less than an hour from Anmer Hall, and the couple socialise with Baron Howard of Rising’s children Annabel, Charlie and Tom who William plays football with. The Duke’s cousin Laura Fellowes and her husband Nick Pettman also live in West Norfolk. The couple already have a list of favourite pubs. Two weeks ago, they shared a dinner with six friends at The Crown in nearby East Rudham. William, seated at the head of the table next to his heavily pregnant wife, organised the supper to celebrate them finally moving to Anmer. ‘William and Kate have friends in Norfolk, and they enjoyed a private dinner in a dining room,’ reports a source. ‘They wanted a night out and they can do it here. The locals are very protective of them, as are the pub owners. They organise special tables out of the way of prying eyes and escape routes so they are never seen coming in or leaving.’ The couple have been seen dining at the Dabbling Duck in Great Massingham, the King’s Head in Great Bircham and the Rose and Crown at Snettisham. While they are relaxed, their discreet security detail of five protection officers remains on high alert. Friends say the plan is for Carole to move in to look after her daughter once William resumes work following a fortnight’s paternity leave. The Duke, 32, will be stationed at Cambridge Airport when he is fully trained to fly a powerful EC145 T2 helicopter. He is said to be ‘enormously excited’ about flying again, but it will be a challenge juggling his new career with official duties. William will be based at Cambridge Airport as part of his duties with the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service . The Cambridges have already enjoyed dinner with friends at one of their locals, the Crown Inn at East Rudham . The Mail on Sunday has been told that William has implemented a number of changes to his diary and will be cutting back on black-tie charity events in particular. Instead, a friend insisted, he plans to continue with the informal, more intimate charity work he loves. A spokesman for the Duke said he remains committed to his charities, adding: ‘The Duke’s intent is to work as full time as possible. He starts flying in the summer and his roster will take into account his official engagements. These will be broadly consistent with previous years.’ Meanwhile, his family will be staying in the background. Princes William and Harry were filmed as toddlers playing the piano in the Kensington Palace nursery with their parents, but William and Kate have refused to allow the cameras into their home. Pointedly, Prince George fulfilled his only official engagement on the other side of the world in Wellington during the couple’s tour of New Zealand and Australia. That short yet charming photocall has been his sole appearance in the public eye. Diana strove to create as ordinary a life as possible for her boys and William wants the same for his own children. He has seen the charm, security and joys of a happy family life with the Middletons and it is what he desires for his own family. Both he and Kate realise such a dream is far more realistic far from the madding crowds at Anmer Hall.","William and Kate are turning Anmer Hall into a secluded fortress home .

8303,"Proud parents bragging about their little darling's every move on Facebook is a regular annoyance for many people using the social network. But one Australian woman got so sick of her friend's constant updates about her baby daughter that she wrote her a scathing letter demanding the mother stop - claiming she is 'p*****g a lot of people off'. Jade Ruthven, 33, was so upset by the 'poison pen' note that she got her own back by forwarding it onto comedian Em Rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media. Scroll down for video . Too many posts: The letter claims Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook . The 'poison pen' letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide . The incredible printed letter, littered with expletives and exclamation marks, starts with the anonymous author saying they had got together with 'a few of the girls' to say they are 'SO OVER' the running commentary of Ms Ruthven's life with her young baby daughter Addison. It adds: 'Look we all have kids that we are besotted with - guess what - every parent thinks their child is the best. But we don't ram it down everyone else's neck!!! 'She wears a new outfit - well take a photo and send it PRIVATELY to the person who gave it to her - not to everyone!!! 'She crawls off the mat - we DON'T care!!!!! She's 6 months old - BIG DEAL!!! 'Stop and think - if every mother posted all that c**p about their kid - I'm sure you'd get over it pretty quickly, . 'We can't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you won't have time to be on Facebook quite so much.' The letter claims to show what 'people really think' about mother Jade's constant Facebook updates, adding: 'We can't wait for you to get back to work -maybe you won't have time to be on Facebook quite so much'. Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . After saying they think the offending child is 'gorgeous' and they 'love her', the writer continues - adding that Ms Ruthven is 'p*****g a lot of people off'. 'We all thought it might ease off after the first month, but it hasn't', it adds. Not everyone is as interested as you are about what [deleted] does so give us all a break. 'We're doing this to let you know what people really think.' For Ms Ruthven the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. ‘I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. ‘At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. ‘I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so call friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. ‘To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don’t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . ‘My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. ‘These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It’s quite sad really.’ The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies, particularly when she released how damaging this kind of behaviour can be. ‘To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,’ said Jade. ‘Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. ‘But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!’ However, Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. ‘No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,’ laughs Jade. ‘That’s how I think this person/people can’t be that close to me. ‘If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook.' Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’. ‘The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.’ Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . Comedian Em Rusciano wrote an 870-word opinion piece about the letter for Australian website news.com.au, after Jade sent it to her through Facebook. Questioning why the offended women didn't just speak to Jade or 'unfollow' her on Facebook, Ms Rusciano said: 'It’s not like she busted into their houses armed with life-size portraits of her child dressed as a tiny adorable pumpkin and demand that they be hung on every wall. 'Obviously in some people’s opinion she’s been overdoing it on the proud mother moments. 'Annoying, yes. Worthy of an anonymous poison pen situation, no.' Ms Rusciano added the 'mean' letter represents the 'Holy Trinity' of anxiety. 'It attacked her mothering, her self-perspective and probably left her feeling as though all her friends had turned on her' she wrote. 'It honestly doesn’t feel as though “the girls” just wanted Jade to change a particular behaviour, . 'it feels as though they wanted her to feel c**p about herself. 'If this were me I would have felt ambushed, alone and obsessed with finding out who “the girls” actually were so I may understand their motivation better.'","Jade Ruthven, 33, from Perth, received angry anonymous letter .

6950,"Dubai is renowned as the playground of the rich and famous. It is a melting pot of decadence in the Middle East with year-round sunshine, some of the best hotels on the planet, and shopping opportunities to seriously damage the credit card. Despite the restrictions of local religious laws, the champagne-fuelled party life has come to somewhat define Dubai as a holiday destination. Dubai: It's still 'bling' but the natural habitat of the mega-wealthy has a developing cultural underside . Because of this, I have always regarded this UAE state as the natural habitat for the types of mega-wealthy who like to splash their cash; Premier League footballers, nightclub owners, rappers and reality TV stars - the Rooneys and the cast of The Only Way Is Essex will continue to flock to Dubai. So I was surprised to discover that Dubai has a rapidly developing cultural underside. In recent times, the place has attracted more unlikely visitors - A-listers including Emily Blunt, Cate Blanchett, Lily Allen, Karl Lagerfeld and Sarah Jessica Parker. Blunt was guest of honour at the recent Dubai International Film Festival, following in the footsteps of the Oscar-winning Ms Blanchett, who attended in 2013. Lily Allen was in town in November with The Verve's Richard Ashcroft to perform at Dubai's first-ever Party In The Park at the Media City Amphitheatre. And although Lily was ordered to censor her lyrics - 'They told me to cover up and not swear!' she announced on stage - punters said the relaxed atmosphere, cool crowd and outdoor, grassy setting made the festival feel like Dubai's answer to Glastonbury. Lily Allen performed at Dubai's first Party in the Park . There is now the annual Dubai International Jazz Festival. This year, Sting and James Blunt performed in February. And work is also under way to build Dubai's first opera house in The Lagoons area. The 2,500-seat venue is anticipated to be complete in 2017. Karl Lagerfeld showed his Chanel Cruise collection in Dubai, while Sarah Jessica Parker decamped from Manhattan to launch her shoe collection in The Mall of the Emirates in December. And with Western shopping meccas Bloomingdales and Harvey Nichols now established, and US emporium Macy's on the cards to open in the next few years, the retail scene also caters for more sophisticated customers. According to Cressida Meale, deputy editor of fashion magazine Grazia Middle East, there is even an underground fashion scene emerging in the city's industrial area, Al Quoz. 'It has pop-up fashion shops and cool Dubai designers,' says Meale. 'There really is another shopping side to Dubai, away from the malls.' There are also several trendy art galleries in this area. So why the sudden cultural shift? Two things seem to have happened in recent times. Firstly the party scene has relocated an hour down the road to Abu Dhabi, thanks in part to the launch of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and Ferrari World (the world's first theme park devoted to the Italian motors). Second, Dubai was also recently made host to the global Expo 2020, an honour of which it is very proud. The Government is pumping millions into creating the infrastructure for the global mega-event. So Dubai has upped its game, and with great results. Now art, music and fashion events are near-weekly fixtures on the calendar. Of course, all this has not stopped the partying - there's just a more sophisticated crowd of revellers. Branches of Western nightclubs lead the way, starting with Mayfair's most famous one, Mahiki. Art exhibitions are on the rise such as the Mojo art gallery in Al Quoz district in Duba (above) Since the club opened its doors in Jumeirah Beach Hotel three years ago, Movida and Pacha have arrived too. Do the clubs worry about Abu Dhabi stealing their party crown and cliental? Apparently not. The general consensus is that Abu Dhabi has a lot to learn from Dubai. Indeed, Mahiki recently took the party to Abu Dhabi - and arguably the greatest VIP guest of all, Prince Harry. In November the nightclub hosted a pop-up venue on a yacht for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and, of course, the party-loving Prince couldn't resist sinking a few rum cocktails on board. But when it comes to hotels, Dubai has always been ahead. I was lucky enough to stay at the world-famous Jumeirah Burj Al Arab. World famous: The Jumeirah Burj Al Arab towers over the malls and souks of Dubai . Not only did my visit coincide with the UAE's National Day, it was also the architecturally unique hotel's 15th birthday. I have never seen a fireworks display and laser show like it. I was completely bowled over by the world-class level of service at the suite-only hotel, and even had my own butler on hand for the duration of the stay. The Al Muntaha restaurant, in the perpendicular pod that juts from the side of the building on the 27th floor, not only served the most exquisite fish, but the bartender made a mean martini too. It's little wonder the hotel that prides itself as 'the world's most luxurious' has a regular roll-call of royalty and A-listers staying. Many arrive by helicopter, landing on the helipad perched on top of the sail. Apparently it is used nearly every day. I had to slum it with a chauffeur driven Rolls-Royce Phantom picking me up at the airport. I'll be sure to book the chopper next time... The Best of Burj package costs from £2,850 per couple and includes two nights' B&B in a two-floor suite (minimum stay two nights), with private butler, dinner both evenings at Burj Al Arab's signature restaurant, massages and set of Hermes amenities.

5807,"A University of South Carolina ex-sorority girl has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room. The white female student, who has not been identified, was captured in a Snapchat photo detailing several 'reasons why USC WiFi blows' on the board at the university in Columbia, South Carolina. Her reasons included 'incompetent' professors, 'ratchets', an 'overpopulated campus' and parking. But at the top of the list was the word 'n*****s'. Her actions were captured by a fellow student. Scroll down for video . Suspended: This University of South Carolina student has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room . After the shocking image was posted online, the girl, who was a member of the campus's Kappa Delta Chapter sorority until last year, was identified by other students and condemned for the slur. However, she is yet to be named by school officials. Now, university president Harris Pastides has announced that the student has been suspended  - and is also facing a USC code of conduct inquiry. In a statement, Mr Pastides said: 'The unfortunate and disappointing act of a student in a study room has challenged the Carolina community to reflect on our values and tell the world what we believe. 'Respect for all is at the heart of the Carolinian Creed, the code by which we agree to abide. Racist and uncivil rhetoric have no place at the University of South Carolina.'

3099,"Sales of a Burberry poncho (modelled by Cara Delevigne) carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £1,000 have helped boost profits . The poncho originated as a rather humble garment worn by South American tribes and later featured on the back of Clint Eastwood in the Spaghetti westerns. However, sales of a designer-label version carrying a personal monogram and costing more than £1,000 have been central to a sales boom at the very British prestige brand Burberry. The ponchos - together with heritage trench coats and scarves - have boosted Burberry sales by 10 per cent over the winter. The wool-and-cashmere designs, which were first modelled on the catwalk by Cara Delevingne, were a huge success among celebrities before Christmas. Famous names including Victoria Beckham, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Sienna Miller and Sarah Jessica Parker were all seen sporting the ponchos, each monogrammed with their initials. And while the original inspiration for the designs may have been a rather modest attempt to keep out harsh weather, there was nothing modest about the Burberry version. The basic asking price was £895, while 70 per cent of sales went to customers who wanted their initials monogrammed on to the weave at the cost of an extra £200. The firm said its scarves and trench coats were a hit with customers and ‘investment and innovation in ponchos drove exceptional growth’. Chief financial officer, Carol Fairweather, described the impact of the ponchos as ‘phenomenal’ and suggested new variants are in the pipeline adding: ‘There’s lots more to come from the poncho story.’ The British brand has become a global success with sales up 10 per cent for the six months to the end of March compared to the year before, taking from up to £1.42 billion. Sales were particularly strong in the UK and Europe, not least because hordes of tourists from China flocked here to buy designer clothes and bags. Currency fluctuations meant its trademark coats and scarves were up to 50 per cent cheaper in European cities than Hong Kong, where the Chinese traditionally shop for luxury merchandise. Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured left) and Sienna Miller (right) both own the Burberry poncho . Model Suki Waterhouse (pictured left) and socialite Olivia Palermo (right) both have monogrammed versions . Such was the price gap that Chinese entrepreneurs have been snapping up huge quantities of luxury label merchandise in Europe and then shipping it back to China to sell at a profit on the grey market. Today bosses at Burberry suggested they plan to follow other luxury brands, such as Chanel and Cartier, and harmonise prices around the globe to stop this happening. This could mean some price increases in Europe and falls in the Far East. Burberry’s success has leaned heavily on a marketing campaign featuring celebrity British models. Cara Delvigne starred in commercials for its trench coats and also appeared alongside Kate Moss promoting the new My Burberry fragrance. Around 70 per cent of the My Burberry bottles were monogrammed, a service the brand offers for free, suggesting personalisation of luxury products is a huge draw for consumers. Twelve-year-old Romeo Beckham featured in a popular pre-Christmas campaign and Suki Waterhouse, the English model and actress, was the face of the brand’s beauty range. Burberry saw ‘double digit’ sales growth in the United States and Europe and trading was particularly buoyant in Britain, France and Italy, from both locals and tourists. Models led by Cara Delevigne wear the poncho on the Burberry catwalk (left) while British model Rosie Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wore hers on a recent shopping trip, specially monogrammed with her initials . Richard Hunter, of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ‘Burberry remains in fashion following a trading update which underscores its ability to capitalise on its chosen markets. ‘The overall picture is extremely healthy – the strength of the digital contribution, particular product growth in the likes of the iconic trench coats and scarves and pleasing performances from the Americas and most of Europe. ‘In addition, the company is well positioned for future, selective growth in terms of both stores and lines, such as beauty. ‘It seems that everything about Burberry is premium – its brand, its products and perhaps of late its share price – a 25 per cent increase over the last year compares to a 7.5 per cent rise for the wider FTSE100.’ Chief executive Christopher Bailey, who took over from Angela Ahrendts in May last year, said new products had helped to boost sales. ‘We are pleased to report a robust second half performance, despite an uncertain external environment,’ he said. ‘We anticipate external challenges will continue in the current year, but remain confident in our long-term strategy to build the Burberry brand and business globally.’ Chief executive Christopher Bailey (pictured) said new products have helped to boost Burberry's sales .","Sales of £1,100 poncho spotted on stars have boosted Burberry's profits .

7504,"A Chicago single mother has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change.

9117,"A brother and sister were left severely disabled after maternity staff at the hospital where they were both born, two years apart, made the same mistakes. Paula McKay was told her daughter Natasha had suffered brain damage and would be left disabled after errors were made by medics at the former Sharoe Green Hospital in Preston. When she became pregnant with her second child, less than two years later, she was reassured the same mistakes would not be repeated. But the promise was an empty one. When Patrick was delivered at the same hospital, the same errors were made, leaving her son brain damaged and severely disabled like his older sister. Ms McKay, from Leyland, near Preston, has been awarded £13 million in compensation, a £7 million care package for her daughter five years after a £6 million sum for her son's lifelong care was agreed. Paula McKay, centre, has won a 20-year legal battle to secure £13 million compensation for her two children Natasha, 24, left and Patrick, 22, right. They were both left severely disabled after the same mistakes were repeated by staff at the same hospital, two years apart, during their births . Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage . Natasha, who is now 24, is confined to a wheelchair and will rely on 24-hour care from a team of nurses who help her dress and eat for the rest of her life. After she was starved of oxygen at birth, Natasha was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage. Seventeen months later when she became pregnant with her son, Patrick, Ms McKay returned to the same hospital. Staff assured her, the same mistakes would not be repeated. However, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son. As a result of the mistakes made, Patrick, now 22, was left brain-damaged and with cerebral palsy. Ms McKay, who has since divorced Natasha and Patrick's father and remarried, said what had happened to her family was a nightmare. 'Natasha and Patrick have been through so much in their lives and it has been heart-breaking to see them suffer at times due to the injuries they were left with.' She told the Telegraph: 'It has been a huge struggle. This feels like the end of a very long, dark tunnel. 'It’s obviously devastating for it to happen to one of your children, but for it to happen to two of them, you just can’t take it in.' She added: 'It upsets me to think about any other families going through the same ordeal and having to fight hospital trusts to help children they have failed. 'However I would say to any other parents in the same situation not to give up hope, you can eventually get the help you and your child needs and things can get better.' The family have fought for 20 years to secure compensation to ensure Natasha and Patrick will receive the care they need for life. In 2008 the NHS North West strategic health authority, formerly the body responsible for the hospital, admitted liability in Patrick's case. Two years later the NHS Litigation Authority paid £6 million for his ongoing care. When Ms McKay went into labour with her second child, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son . Natasha and Patrick both suffered brain damage, and as a result were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Natasha is confined to a wheelchair and requires 24-hour care from a team of nurses . However, Natasha's case took longer to investigate and conclude, because it was extremely complicated. The strategic health authority, which no longer exists, admitted liability in her case five years ago when she was 19. The final compensation, again paid by the NHS Litigation Authority, was delayed to allow Natasha to finish at Beaumont College, a specialist college for people affected by cerebral palsy. The delay also allowed for a property to be bought, extended and adapted for Natasha, to live with a team of full-time carers. Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition that affects movement and co-ordination. It is often caused by brain damage, during or shortly after birth. Other causes of the condition include: . It is estimated that around one in 400 people in the UK is affected. The symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. The main characteristics of the condition are: . The symptoms can affect different areas of the body and vary in severity from person to person. Many sufferers will also suffer repeated seizures, drooling problems and swallowing difficulties. Some will also have communication and learning difficulties. Source: NHS Choices . The family have now been awarded £7 million in Natasha's case. Ms McKay said the final settlement has brought her some comfort, reassuring her that her children will always be cared for. 'I am relieved that I no longer have to worry about what will happen when I am not here anymore, and that both will have access to the specialist care they need and deserve,' she said. 'Another important factor of this financial settlement is that it will ensure Natasha receives excellent ongoing care that will not ever be affected by local or national budget cuts.' Olivia Scates, a partner at JMW Solicitors, who represented both Natasha and Patrick, said this was an 'unprecedented situation' where two children in one family had suffered brain damage and cerebral palsy as a result of negligence. 'Paula has had to cope with two avoidable tragedies involving her children,' she said. 'To go through such an ordeal once and a child's life to be devastated is tragic, for it to happen to two children in the same family is unbelievably sad. 'However Paula is an incredible mother who has dedicated her life to caring for Natasha and Patrick and has conducted herself with great dignity throughout their cases. 'Nothing can be done to turn back the clock but with the settlement of Natasha's case Paula will have the support she needs to provide that care to her daughter and ensure that she does not have to worry about the future, especially when she is not here anymore, which was a huge concern. 'Natasha will never be able to live independently, work or do any of the things the rest of us take for granted. 'However as well as the highly specialist accommodation and equipment she requires now she will have access to excellent care that will improve her quality of life and enable her to access therapies and activities designed for people with her level of disability.' Ms McKay has a third child, George, now 19, who was born at Kings College in London without any complications. He is now training to become a nurse, to continue to help disabled people in his working life, after helping care for his siblings at home. Sharoe Green Hospital closed in 2004, when it merged with the Royal Preston Hospital to become Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.","Natasha, 24, and Patrick Jackson, 22, were both left brain damaged at birth .

7675,"A hue of blue inspired by the waters of Hawaii is a prominent feature of the Obama state china service being unveiled by the White House. President Barack Obama is a Hawaii native who returns every Christmas for vacation. Michelle Obama's office says the first lady chose what's being called 'Kailua Blue' to distinguish her family's china from the red, green, blue and yellow used on more recent state services. Scroll down for video . Went bright: Michelle Obama chose a bold, watery blue hue to accent the Obama White House's official china . Pickard, America's oldest fine china company, has been in business since 1893. In that time, their high end offerings have won them an extremely discerning clientele, including: . Air Force One . Camp David . Gracie Mansion . King of Saudia Arabia . South Carolina Governor's Mansion . United Nations . United States Air Force . United States Department of State . Source . 'It's a modern and fresh color not previously seen on state chinas, but Mrs. Obama's main goal was to create a modern service that is completely compatible and interchangeable and usable with all the historic china services,' White House Curator William Allman said during a preview of Tuesday's state dinner. A fluted band of Kailua Blue, framed by a textured gold rim and a simple gold inner line, appears on all pieces of the service, except the dinner and serving plates. The solid white dinner plates are edged in gold; the service plates have a wide gold rim and the presidential coat of arms at the center. The china, which has settings for 320 people, cost approximately $367,000. It was paid for from a private fund that is administered by the White House Historical Association and used to acquire fine and decorative arts for the presidential mansion. The state china service then-first lady Laura Bush unveiled in January 2009 cost $493,000. It was being unveiled Monday during a preview for Tuesday's state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 'If you've seen our state dinners, we really do a lot of mixing and matching — sometimes because we really do not have enough, sometimes because we're trying to create a new modern, different, edgy kind of look,' Mrs. Obama told Architectural Digest last week when she previewed the Obama state china for interior design journalists and bloggers. 'This Kailua Blue is one of those colors that will complement some of the other pieces already in the collection in a way that's elegant, and I think it will be timeless.'

Long process: Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One . The Obama state china service was paid for with money from a private fund that is used to buy fine and decorative arts for the White House and is administered by the White House Historical Association. The cost was not disclosed. There is no requirement for presidents to have a state china service and some, including Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, had none. Planning began in the fall of 2011 when Mrs. Obama and family friend and designer Michael Smith began gathering feedback from members of the White House residence staff. Three years ago, in the spring of 2012, Pickard China, of Antioch, Illinois, was brought in to consult on the project. The company has made dinnerware for use at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and aboard Air Force One. Mrs. Obama wanted the state china service to have modern elements but also be practical, said the White House, which was unveiling it earlier than recent administrations. Each setting includes a first for presidential tableware — an individual tureen that can be used for soup, dessert or 'any other dish that the chefs get creative and decide they would like to serve with a little panache in an individual serving size,' Allman said. Then-first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton were not around to use the state china services they introduced just weeks before their husbands left office.

Former Real Madrid ace Kaka runs at the Portland Timbers defence at Providence Park in Oregon . Like so often in the early stages of this season, all eyes were on former Real Madrid ace Kaka as traveling Orlando looked to continue their unbeaten away run. Creating chances for fun has been the Brazilians job since arriving in America, but it was English representative Ridgewell who had the biggest influence of the first-half. Ridgewell, who enjoyed spells with Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion, failed to deal with a clearance as Orlando threatened the Timbers defence. His week header fell kindly to Molino who flashed the ball across goal before the ball struck Larin and evaded goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey. On first glance the goal seemed fortunate, but video replays showed Larin turn and chest the ball into the goal smartly to give Orlando the lead.

5193,"Apple Inc has approached more than a dozen musicians, including British band Florence and the Machine, in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be streamed on Beats, according to a new report. The company is in talks with Florence and the Machine to give Apple limited streaming rights to a track from their album set to be released in June, Bloomberg said. Apple has also approached Taylor Swift and others about partnerships, the report said. Beats-ing the competition? Apple Inc has approached more than a dozen musicians, including Taylor Swift and British band Florence and the Machine in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be streamed on Beats . Apple declined to comment. Beats Music will be re-launched in coming months. There will be a $9.99-a-month subscription for individuals and a family plan for $14.99, according to sources, Bloomberg said. Apple bought audio equipment and music streaming company Beats for about $3 billion in May 2014, hoping to catch up in fast-growing music streaming industry. Music streaming service Tidal, launched last month by rapper Jay Z, is also trying to convince artists to sign exclusive deals for their content, to fend off competition from services such as Spotify and Google Inc's YouTube. Competitors: The Jay Z-backed Beats competitor Tidal has a slew of big name co-owners including Madonna, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. Here, Beyonce and Madonna attend the Tidal launch in New York March 30 . Tidal isn't new, but it's getting a reboot from rapper Jay-Z, who bought the Scandinavian company behind it, Aspiro. Madonna, Rihanna and Beyonce are among the co-owners. That's notable because many artists complain about how little payment they get from other music services, such as Spotify. As owners, artists could insist on better deals. The membership-based service  will provide music and video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. It is being offered at two price points: $10 for standard sound quality and $20 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' SPOTIFY . One of the most popular music services, with 60 million active users worldwide, and a quarter of them paying subscribers. Just this week, Spotify launched an app on Sony's PlayStation game console. The two companies worked closely to make listening seamless, so music can be heard in the background while playing games, without losing the game's sound effects, for instance. Spotify offers unlimited listening and Internet radio. It's free with ads; on mobile devices, users are limited to Internet radio and can't choose songs. Paying $10 a month gets you an ad-free premium service that offers song selection and offline playback on mobile devices. PANDORA . Offers Internet radio only. More than 81 million active listeners. Free with ads, or pay $5 a month for an ad-free premium service and higher-quality audio over Web browsers. TIDAL . Unlimited listening. Among the few services offering high-fidelity songs, which many audiophiles prefer over MP3s and other formats that reduce quality in the compression process. Offers music video and curated playlists from experts. $10 a month for standard sound quality and $20 for high fidelity. There's no free offering. APPLE . Pay per song to download and own forever through iTunes. Free Internet radio through iTunes Radio on Apple devices.

Google also offers YouTube Music Key for selected music videos, free of ads, for $10. Paying for one gets you the other, too. AMAZON . Pay-per-song offering. Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership comes with unlimited listening, though the song selection isn't as broad as what rivals offer. SAMSUNG'S MILK MUSIC . Offers free Internet radio like Pandora and others, but tries to make it easier to find music to match your mood.

5418,"A meat trader who swindled cash through a mortgage fraud scam to pay for luxury holidays was ordered to pay back £500,000 today. Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600. Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud . Allen also splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a £700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where £33,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including £1,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back £491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged £8,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World . However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back £10,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. ‘Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,’ prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. ‘The money would have been criminal proceeds.’ During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing £30,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth £7,600 . Mr Evans told the jury: ‘Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.’ Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made. The judge will consider on Thursday whether to impose on Allen a strict financial reporting order which would force him to present the authorities with regular documents showing his use of money.","Grant Allen, 38, spent £30,000 holidaying with girlfriend Gaynor Godwin .

196,"(CNN)Aaron Hernandez is known for his swagger. Should he act any differently when he's on trial for murder? When the once rising star for the New England Patriots walks into court each day with what appears to be an air of confidence -- or is it bravado? -- he enters from a connecting holding room. Some court security officers who escort him are as tall and muscular as he is. Besides that certain bounce to his step, there's usually a smile. Jury deliberations resume Wednesday . Watch ""Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez"" tonight at 9 p.m. ET. It hasn't been there as often in the last couple of weeks when state witnesses have included his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and his former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who testified Hernandez would usually greet him with a kiss and a hug. Always impeccably dressed in suit and tie brought in by his defense team, Hernandez quickly scans the courtroom, usually starting with the rows of seats directly behind him. The front row is reserved for his family. Some days, none of his relatives is there. But when his mother, fiancée, brother and other friends attend, he winks, nods, smiles, jokes, laughs, flirts with his fiancée and mouths greetings to them including ""'thanks for coming' and 'I love you.'"" Twice, he nodded his head and smiled at me. It's not unusual for his lawyers to slap him on his back and huddle before court begins, appearing at ease. They've been representing him since June 2013. There was an unfortunate moment. His mother once asked permission from a court officer to touch her son once the jury left the room. Given an OK, she reached over the bar to him, took one of his hands in hers and kissed it. Rules forbid contact. It did not go unnoticed by the family of victim Odin Lloyd. Hernandez does not avoid looking in their direction. He glances at Lloyd's relatives. Lloyd's mother Ursula Ward, who is in court daily, appears to look right back at Hernandez without expression from her usual seat on the end of a row. When one witness, a high school friend, testifies that Hernandez once allegedly talked about carrying a gun, Hernandez appears to glare at him. When his fiancée takes the stand and testifies Hernandez told her to ditch a box from their basement the day after Lloyd's slaying, his eyes are glued on her. She barely glances his way but does appear to say something as she passes the defense table on the way out. When Kraft is asked to officially point out Hernandez in court and describe what he was wearing, I watch Hernandez look down at his shirt and tie as Kraft detailed his outfit. When the team owner leaves the stand -- the same man who signed him to a $40 million bonus in 2012 -- Hernandez turns and watches him walk out of the courtroom. Would it be the last time he'd see him in person? On the last day of testimony when his defense rests its case, he smiles at relatives. But as he walks out the door this time, he doesn't look back.","Aaron Hernandez, even when on trial for murder, keeps that certain bounce in his step .

4181,Fernando Torres scored his first ever league own goal as Atletico Madrid limped to a 2-2 La Liga draw against Malaga on Saturday. The Spanish striker inadvertently headed a corner at the near post over his own line to pull Malaga back into the game before half-time. Torres has found goals difficult to come by since his January return to the Vicente Calderon and has scored just four times for Diego Simeone's side. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during Atletico Madrid's 2-2 draw with Malaga . The Malaga players celebrate Torres' own goal which pulled the visitors level just before half-time . Atletico were gifted the opening goal as Malaga keeper Carlos Kameni flapped at a long throw by Jesus Gamez and it was left for Antoinne Griezmann to simply knock the ball over the line from close range. Malaga caused little threat in a cagey first half but were given a helping hand by Torres who headed past Jan Oblak. The game opened up in the second half and Malaga midfielder Samu delicately chipped the ball over Oblak with 20 minutes left.

5185,"1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 68 . 2. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 55 . 3. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 51 . Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger. He was sitting next to Lewis Hamilton — as close as the German had got to his Mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the Chinese Grand Prix — at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations. Rosberg, whose usual coiffured, Euro-chic sheen had vanished, alleged that Hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race. The record states that Hamilton won, Rosberg was second and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel third. But Rosberg feared he might be overtaken by Vettel before the second round of pit stops when Hamilton, then leading from pole position, slowed down a few fractions of a second — to conserve his tyres, he said. Lewis Hamilton is now 13 points clear in the race for the drivers' championship after winning the Chinese Grand Prix .

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. ‘I wasn’t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,’ said Hamilton, indignantly. ‘I had no real threat from Nico.’ But Rosberg said: ‘It’s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.’ Hamilton countered: ‘My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.’ Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits’ end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg’s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. ‘We have first and second,’ said the three-time world champion.

One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There’s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. ‘There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that’s it.’ For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen’s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having ‘the full house’: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year’s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber, causing Max’s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen’s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull’s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat’s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. Button’s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired .

4988,"A 19-year-old Minnesota teen has been charged with fatally stabbing a 34-year-old father-of-five after an argument on the Wisconsin side of the St Croix River.about swearing took a deadly turn. Peter Kelly, who leaves behind a wife in addition to five children under the age of nine, was killed on Tuesday night when he was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend argued with three teens. One of the teenagers, Levi Acre-Kendall, was charged with one count of first-degree reckless homicide on Friday by the Polk County attorney's office. Scroll down for video . Peter Kelly was fatally stabbed on Tuesday night at the St Croix River after an argument with three teenagers . Levi Acre-Kendall, 19, was charged with one count of first-degree reckless homicide on Friday . Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine. He was just 34 . The suspect, who was held on $125,000 bail, is now facing a maximum sentence of 60 years of combined prison and extended supervision. During the alleged incident, Kelly and Ross Lechman were fishing on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River when they heard three teens being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side. They asked them to quiet down and heated words were exchanged for the next three hours. The suspect's mother, Lavonne Acre, said of her son: 'Levi's a good kid. He was just fishing' Kelly and Lechman eventually drover over to Interstate Park and confronted the three teenagers. There are differing accounts about what happened, but Lechman told investigators Acre-Kendall showed a knife during the argument, the Pioneer Press reported. He later reportedly said: 'Yes, yes, I stabbed him.' Lechman called 911 after the stabbing and Kelly was taken to St Croix Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Acre-Kendall's mother, Lavonne Acre, turned a knife and clothes her son was wearing on Tuesday over to police, the Star Tribune reported. She said: 'All I can tell you is that it would have never happened if it weren't for those two older men coming to the boys, because the boys were just fishing. 'Levi's a good kid. He was just fishing.' There is still uncertainty about stabbing and the argument that caused it. Polk County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Steve Moe said: 'I think it's just something that we're still aggressively working on, is all.' Acre-Kendall is now facing a maximum sentence of 60 years of combined prison and extended supervision . Now the small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of Kelly, who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark said. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark told Fox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stays at home to care for their children. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Kelly and Ross Lechman were fishing on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River when the argument began . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckleheads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300.

'There are two types of Anzac biscuits: crunchy and chewy, and while I'll happily eat both I prefer crunchy,' says Lorraine Elliott of food blog Not Quit Nigella. 'These Anzac biscuits are definitely of the crunchy variety. Think brandy snaps or toffee in their tooth feel.

Ingredients . 1 cup oats . 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar . 1 cup/125 g/4.4 ozs macadamia nuts, chopped . 3/4 cup plain or all purpose flour . 1/2 cup desiccated coconut . 130g/4.6 ozs butter . 2 tablespoons golden syrup (can also use honey) 1 tablespoon hot water mixed with 1/2 teaspoon bi carbonate of soda . 250g/1/2 pound dark chocolate (optional) Method . 1. Preheat oven to 175°C/375°F. Line two large trays with parchment (you will actually put six biscuits on each tray so you can line four baking trays if you want). Not Quite Nigella's Lorraine prefers crunchy Anzac biscuits . In a medium sized bowl mix the oats, brown sugar, flour, nuts and coconut so that it is evenly distributed. 2. In a small saucepan (or even in the microwave) melt the butter until completely melted. Add the golden syrup and bi-carb and water mix. Whisk to combine and then add this liquid mixture to the dry mixture and stir until everything is moistened. Shape into walnut sized balls with hands and place far apart on the baking sheet as they will spread a lot - I fit six per tray. Bake for 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the tray for five to ten minutes and then place on a cooling rack as they will firm up then. Repeat with rest of the dough. 3. If you are making these with chocolate, melt the chocolate in a double boiler (a heatproof bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water ensuring that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water) or in the microwave on 50 per cent power with 60 second bursts, stirring between bursts. Spread the chocolate over the bottom with an angled spatula and leave bottoms up to set. For more recipes, visit Not Quite Nigella. Sweet: These versions are thinner like brandy snaps .

2187,"US authorities suspected that a British man accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 it's been revealed, with experts expressing shock that it took six years for charges to be brought. Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of making £26million from illegal trades over five years and an investigation team involving six agencies in the US and Britain want him put on trial in New York. But analysts are bewildered that it's taken this long for action to be taken. US authorities suspected that British man Navinder Singh Sarao (circled) accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 . US prosecutors believe Mr Sarao used special computer software to manipulate the market on Wall Street . 'Flash crash': Sarao is accused of causing the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' on May 6, 2010, when £570billion ($850 billion) was wiped from the value of America's biggest companies in five minutes . Sarao was warned about his trading in 2009 by officials at the self-regulatory Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where he was making transactions. However, he continued his alleged manipulation well into this year. Dave Lauer, president of lobbying and research firm Kor Group, told Bloomberg that he was gobsmacked at the pace of the investigation. He said: 'How this continued for six years when the CME appeared to know about it, it kind of boggles my mind. This is about as simple and easy as you can get, and it took them this long to do anything about it.' Edgar Perez, author of Knightmare on Wall Street and The Speed Traders, meanwhile, asked: 'Why would regulators let Sarao operate in the markets and engage in similar trading strategies as in the Flash Crash eight more times?' Sarao allegedly triggered – from his home computer in Hounslow, London – the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' of May 2010, in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices, using a series of fake transactions. Trader Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is shown here at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested over illicit trading . A flash crash is a sudden plunge in stock prices. On May 6, 2010, the US stock market dramatically collapsed – wiping billions off the world's biggest companies. Between 2.42pm and 2.47pm, the Dow Jones shed 600 points, having already been down more than 300 points – a startling 6 per cent fall in just five minutes. Very soon it had recorded an almost 1,000-point loss on the day. But, by 3.07pm, the market had miraculously regained most of the 600-point drop – making the flash crash the second-largest point swing ever recorded. Hours later, European markets opened and crashed in similar fashion. The UK's FTSE 100 fell 138 points, France's Cac shed 163 points, and Germany's Dax dropped 193 points. The cause of the crash puzzled US officials. Theories included technical glitches, high frequency trading or changes in market structure – but never criminal activity. He allegedly used automated trading software to 'spoof' the market by placing up to 19,000 orders and then cancelling them, all in under one second. However, manipulation wasn't identified as the cause of the crash in a September 2010 report, suggesting that regulators did not see his activity at that time. Tim Massad, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the trading of futures and swaps, said on Wednesday that it took so long to charge Sarao because of the size and complexity of U.S. derivatives markets. 'These are huge markets,' he said. 'There's a lot going on.' The agency, which oversees self-regulatory bodies such as the CME, brought civil charges against Sarao alongside criminal charges by the Department of Justice. The many years it took for the CFTC to come out with its findings, and the fact that manipulation wasn't mentioned in the 2010 report, suggested that the help of a whistleblower was essential in bringing the charges, one lawyer said. 'This can't have been a five-year continuous investigation, can't have been,' said the lawyer, who is familiar with the CFTC's thinking, and who asked to remain anonymous. 'Something happened some period later where this came up again. 'If there was any indication that there was manipulation behind this, given the profile of this, the agency would have proceeded. It wouldn't have taken five years.' Scotland Yard's extradition unit arrested Sarao on Tuesday night at the request of the FBI, which claims he set up an offshore company in the Caribbean called 'Nav Sarao Milking Markets' and arrogantly told financial officials to 'kiss my a***'. In West London, neighbours of the man now dubbed the 'Hound of Hounslow' were puzzled by his supposed wealth, saying he lived humbly.","Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of causing the May 2010 'flash crash'

10255,"Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation . Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'","Blackpool fans protested against owners, the Oyston family, before their 1-1 draw against Reading on Tuesday night .

2431,"Bournemouth are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium - as a tactic to help them next season. The away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the South Stand and the East Stand. Manager Eddie Howe prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd. Bournemouth will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium . Premier League rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation . Bournemouth officials are considering doubling the South Stand from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000, taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000. However, Premier League regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters. This would mean that, should Bournemouth press ahead with the expansion, away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against Howe’s wishes. Last year, the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed, but the logistics of that make it unlikely. Just to expand the South Stand would cost the club £1.8million and, over the course of a season, they would only accrue £900,000 in ticket sales. Any construction would, therefore, be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage. Manager Eddie Howe is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal . With a capacity of 12,000 Bournemouth look set to have the smallest ground in the Premier League . The club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to Premier League rules, something which was not a requirement in the Championship. The press box, which at present separates home and away fans in the East Stand, will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts. Stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches.

Troy Deeney scores as Watford beat Middlesbrough on Monday in a crucial clash in the Championship . Matt Ritchie . Club: Bournemouth. Position: Winger. Age: 25. Games: 41. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's £400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Bradley Johnson . Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney . Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Patrick Bamford . Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer . Will Hughes . Club: Derby. Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. Games: 39. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako . Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up . Alex Pritchard . Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month . Tyrone Mings . Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January . We’ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs. This side would surely stay up in the Premier League with ease... Composite XI (4-2-3-1): John Ruddy (Norwich); Dominic Iorfa (Wolves), Russell Martin (Norwich), Steve Cook (Bournemouth), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich); Will Hughes (Derby), Bradley Johnson (Norwich); Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Bakary Sako (Wolves); Troy Deeney (Watford).","Championship top eight separated by just nine points with game to go .

1676,"Modern technology is supposed to be making our lives easier, but often all it does is create more pitfalls. 21st century additions like a Facebook page, an Instagram profile and a smart phone often end up doing more damage to a budding relationship than good. These days we are more connected than ever, but that regularly pushes a potential partner further away. Smart phones and social media often cause nightmare for men and women on dates (picture posed by models) On a date in the 1990s, the biggest fails a person could be responsible for were a lack of conversation, food in the teeth or a man asking the woman to split the bill. Nowadays, the man or woman is also likely to try and photograph their food or keep checking their phone at the table. Girls are often caught out spending too much time in the bathroom, while they compare notes on their evening with friends as their date is sat back at the table. And after the evening is over both parties can fall foul of the temptation to get in touch too quickly - texting within hours of the meeting or checking out the other person's Facebook profile immediately. While on a date it is considered rude to leave your phone on the table  (picture posed by models) To save the embarrassment of being chucked before the relationship has heated up because of your addiction to technology, Blu e-cigarettes have listed the top ten ways to avoid showing yourself up. They include leaving conversations about the dating app Tinder to evenings with your friends, and checking with a potential boyfriend or girlfriend before changing your relationship on Facebook. - Keep phones off the dining table; your date wants to see your face, not your screen. - Don’t be tempted to take a snap of your food for instagram - it will look like you’re more interested in your followers than your date. - Refrain from ‘checking in’ your location online too; it could easily turn into a ‘live-tweet’ scenario or worse, a ‘helpful’ friend might drop by to see how it’s going. - Keep it offline; immediately changing your relationship status on Facebook if the date’s gone well is a sure-fire way to scare off your date. - If it goes really well, it might be time to move the chat away from text; take it to the next level and give them a call a few days after the date. - Do keep your taxi app handy in case you need to make a quick exit from a date disaster and you don’t have any cash . - If you must update your friends on how the date’s going, use snapchat – it won’t leave any evidence! - Don’t brag about the number of matches you’ve had on Tinder, they won’t appreciate it . - Don’t assume your date will find that funny cat meme as hilarious as your friends did! - And finally, leave the Google Glass at home, as recording your companion for post-date analysis isn’t likely to get you a second date .","Social media and smart phones cause a minefield of problems while dating .

1902,"'Cool' credentials: This week Samantha Cameron revealed her love of alternative group Poliça . She rarely misses a chance to demonstrate her ‘cool’ credentials. And this week Samantha Cameron was at it again, revealing her love of alternative group Poliça. But their brand of psychedelic rock conjures up a world a far cry from her life in Downing Street and the Cotswolds. The American band – whose name roughly translates as ‘policy’ in Polish – are inspired by a radical feminist who described pregnancy as ‘barbaric’, and their songs feature violent imagery. The video for the first single on the group’s most recent album depicts androgynous-looking singer Channy Leaneagh subjecting her trussed-up alter ego to a violent assault. Blood spurts in all directions as she smashes her hands with a hammer, punches her in the face and finally waterboards her. Another unsettling song by the four-piece band from Minnesota, entitled Leading To Death, includes the lyric ‘I dream of you, oh my strangler’. Miss Leaneagh, 33, has described her music as ‘rhythm-driven sex noise’ and says the digital effects she uses to modify her broken-hearted vocals are ‘like taking drugs for your voice’. Her marriage broke up several years ago after she had a child, and her lyrics have a tendency towards violent, sexual imagery that bemoans ‘boys’ and ‘all the work they require’. Mrs Cameron, 43, pictured, comes from an aristocratic background and was educated at Marlborough College, whose other alumni include the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Eugenie. But she has a distinctly bohemian streak and was friends with Bristol trip-hop artist Tricky during her time at university. She recently name-checked US indie group The War On Drugs, and claims to be a big fan of Radio 6 Music, the BBC’s ‘cutting edge and ground-breaking’ station. ‘I listen to Radio 4 in the morning and the rest of the day I have 6 Music on,’ she said in a rare interview last weekend. Inspiration: Channy Leaneagh of Polica, a band which specialises in psychedelic rock . Displaying her love of Poliça, Mrs Cameron even joined the crowd at a recent gig in Shoreditch, East London, at which the group played songs from their latest album, Shulamith. The record’s cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman, her hair and neck caked in blood. The title is a tribute to Canadian-born feminist Shulamith Firestone, whom Miss Leaneagh has described as a ‘mentor and muse from the grave’. Miss Firestone, who died in 2012 aged 67, painted a radical vision of a ‘liberated’ world without families, childbirth or any real distinctions between men and women. She is best known for her 1970 manifesto The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For Feminist Revolution, which drew inspiration from Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto. Miss Firestone argued that pregnancy was ‘barbaric’ and childhood was a ‘supervised nightmare’. Poliça's record cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman, her hair and neck caked in blood. The title is a tribute to Canadian-born feminist Shulamith Firestone (above) She looked forward to a new world in which women were to be liberated from men thanks to the scientific breakthroughs which meant that sexual reproduction could happen outside the womb. The radical feminist was also responsible for stunts including unfurling a ‘Women’s Liberation’ banner at a beauty pageant. Later in life she became a recluse and spent time in a mental health hospital. She was found dead in her studio flat, apparently after starving herself to death.","Samantha Cameron recently spoke of her love of alternative group Poliça .

8261,"I see Usain Bolt on the circuit and he’s always good fun. He likes to make jokes of me! I remember in Moscow, at the last World Championships, when I was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner, he killed me in the warmup. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked me. ‘This is for the 200m runners – the 100m was a few days ago. You missed it.’ I told him I was doing the 200m. ‘Why? he asked again. I said I wanted to try it. He was winding me up. It was helping me relax, actually. It was very nice. Adam Gemili says Usain Bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice . The young British athlete says he is nowhere near Bolt's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon . Gemili has announced his participation in the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games this summer . It obviously worked, as I then ran sub-20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me. Bolt gave me some great advice to really enjoy athletics and have fun with it. He told me to have patience with it, make sure you keep enjoying it and you will get serious when you get a bit older and start to take it more seriously but don’t put pressure on yourself to perform. No matter whatever anyone says or writes, make sure you’re always having a good time. He’s good like that. I can take that into this year. I like to think I always have a great time when I go to compete. I always give a big smile before races because you never get bored of that feeling; people cheering for you and making you feel like ‘wow’ all this training you’ve done in the winter and throwing up on the track, all the hard slog is worth it. It’s a brilliant feeling. Hopefully I can get a bit more serious, now that I’ve just finished uni and I will start to get a bit more competitive with those guys. I don’t think Bolt will be too worried about me at the moment, he’s something special when he gets himself into shape and competing. I’m very lucky to be around at this time when he’s at his peak and running. To be in the mix and be a part of these guys is nice. Bolt has been beaten before, which shows he is only human. After those guys have retired — sprinters like Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin — it’ s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle. Obviously the American and Jamaican sprinters have always been the top dogs, they are very powerful nations and hard guys to beat. In Britain and Europe we have some great young names coming through that can go on and push the performances up. I’d like to think there is a chance for British sprinters to step into the void. We don’t do the sport to come second or third. You do the sport to try to be the best. There will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance .

144,"Easley, South Carolina (CNN)The cracker or the bite of ice cream -- Brynn Duncan still isn't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day. Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. ""I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom."" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. ""I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast."" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or ""Hotel Greenville"" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. ""New day, new crisis,"" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. ""The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,"" Melissa says, shaking her head. ""Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. "" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. ""She's always been --"" Melissa Duncan pauses. ""High maintenance!"" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by ""abnormal proliferation and activation"" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. ""It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,"" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how ""angry"" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. ""Oh God, no,"" Afrin says when asked. ""No, no, no, no."" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: ""Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?"" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are ""scary to see and scary to experience."" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.","Brynn Duncan has mast cell disease, which causes her to be allergic to almost everything .

3273,"The family of a teenager who should have died after overdosing on a mix of heroin and Xanax has shared images of him in hospital in a bid to deter others from taking drugs. Brayden Travis, 18, was left without medical attention for seven hours after taking drugs at a friend's house in St Charles County, Missouri in early March. His lungs and kidneys failed, and he suffered a stroke and severe brain damage. Doctors warned that he will likely remain in a vegetative state, his mother, Kelly Smith-Miller, wrote on Facebook. She also shared a starling photograph of the teenager unconscious in a hospital bed with breathing apparatus and wires across his body. Overdose: Brayden Travis, 18, suffered a stroke and severe brain damage after overdosing on heroin and Xanax last month. His mother shared this photo of him to Facebook to deter others from taking drugs . 'If my son's story and picture can save one life or contribute to the education and awareness of drug abuse, then he and I are very happy!' she wrote in her post. 'He wouldn't want this for anyone else and he would tell anyone not to use drugs … ever! I can tell you he tried to fight this addiction and I pray this time it hasn't won!' The post has been shared more than 337,000 times. Brayden is now breathing on his own and wakes up and opens and closes his eyes, although his reactions are inconsistent, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'Medical personnel believe my son should have been dead long before he was able to get the medical attention he needed, but for some unknown reason he has stabilized,' she wrote. Addiction: His mother explained that Brayden, left before the overdose, has struggled with drug addiction since he was 15. He is now conscious in hospital, seen right, and is breathing on his own . 'He is making progress, but we have a long road to travel. Even though the outcome is not expected to be positive, as a mother I will not give up until I have exhausted all options and know that I've done everything I can.' Brayden had long been battling with addiction, she said. He first started smoking marijuana when he was 15 and eventually moved on to heroin. He enrolled in five or six treatment programs and left three of them, she told the Post-Dispatch. He spent eight months in juvenile custody for using drugs and failing drug tests, she added. As he struggled with addiction, he moved between his grandmother's home and his mother's home, and at the time of his overdose, he was living with his father in St Charles County.

7565,"Nigel Farage's controversial claim that foreign nationals with HIV should not be treated on the NHS was part of what insiders called a ‘shock and awful’ strategy. A Ukip source revealed the party had initially planned for Mr Farage to mention the number of foreign patients suffering from tuberculosis, in the leaders debates last night. But when it was discovered that the antiretroviral drugs to treat people with HIV were more expensive, a decision was taken to use that example instead. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage's controversial claim that foreign nationals with HIV should not be treated on the NHS was part of what insiders called a ‘shock and awful’ strategy . Mr Farage was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the NHs that of the 7,000 diagnosed with HIV, 60 per cent were born abroad. After saying this was something the other leaders would be ‘mortified that I dare to even talk about it’, he said: ‘You can come to Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 per year per patient. ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need is to put the National Health Service there for the British people and families who have paid into this system for decades.’ Despite criticism from other parties and viewers, Ukip revealed it had been part of a deliberate strategy to appeal to their ‘core voter’ – not to try and attract floating voters to the party. A Ukip insider said Mr Farage’s remark was ‘a bit spicy’. They added: ‘We were going to go for TB but we found out that the HIV drugs were more expensive’. The strategy, it was claimed, was ‘shock and awe, or as some would call it shock and awful.’ Mr Farage was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the NHs that of the 7,000 diagnosed with HIV, 60 per cent were born abroad . It comes after Ukip’s share of the vote in recent polls has dropped significantly from highs of 19pc late last year, to just 10pc in several polls over the past month, as supporters appear to have returned to the Conservatives and Labour. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South, and last night all of his answers focused on the need to curb immigration. Ukip first MP Douglas Carswell refused to endorse Mr Farage’s remark. Asked several times whether he agreed with it, he said Mr Farage had given ‘credible’ answers in the debate. Douglas Carswell has refused to endorse Mr Farage's remarks . Mr Carswell, the MP for Clacton in Essex, added: ‘It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that’s all I’m going to say.’ George Osborne, the Chancellor, said the remarks were intended to provoke a reaction from ministers and said ‘I’m not going to dignify them with a response’. A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News poll showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat business minister, said the remarks were ‘breathtakingly appalling’. Mr Carswell’s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in The Last King of Scotland. Mr Carswell yesterday insisted the party was not split. He said: ‘I see what you’re trying to do in asking me this slanted question. I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.’ Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: ‘I think this row has been slightly confected. Noone is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.’","Ukip leader said foreigners with HIV should not be treated on the NHS .

6883,"David Bowie, who performed an alien in the cult classic film The Man Who Fell To Earth, has composed music for a new stage version in New York. The British musician long known for his experimentalism has written new songs and arranged older music for the production late this year at the New York Theatre Workshop. Based on the novel by Walter Tevis, the 1976 film starred Bowie as a humanoid who lands on Earth in search of water for his parched planet and becomes enamored with alcohol and television. Flashback: David Bowie is returning to The Man Who Fell To Earth by penning a new stage version and original songs for a production on New York's Broadway later this year. The 1976 cult film marked his debut in movies . Cult classic: Bowie played an alien who was in search of water on Earth but fell in love with television .

2856,"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has ordered an official probe into claims that a civil servant leaked an official account of a private meeting between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. The SNP leader has denied telling French ambassador Sylvie Bermann that she would prefer David Cameron to remain in Number 10 while suggesting that Ed Miliband was not Prime Minister material. Ms Sturgeon told supporters at a rally in Glasgow today that she had written to Sir Jeremy to demand an official investigation. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to investigate the leaked memo . She told supporters in Glasgow today that the Westminster establishment were afraid of the SNP's rise and called on Ed Miliband to commit to 'locking out' David Cameron from Downing Street next month . Ms Sturgeon completely denied claims that she secretly hoped David Cameron would win the election . She claimed that the story was a sign of 'panic' within the Westminster establishment over the surge of support for her party. She then called on Mr Miliband to publicly commit to working with the SNP to 'lock out' Mr Cameron from Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament. Ms Sturgeon described the account of her conversation with the French ambassador as '100 per cent untrue'. The memo was published in the Daily Telegraph was written by a British civil servant following a conversation with consul-general Pierre-Alain Coffinier regarding the meeting between Ms Sturgeon and ambassador Sylvie Bermann, who was on her first visit to Scotland in February. According to the memo: 'Discussion appears to have focused mainly on the political situation, with the FM stating that she wouldn't want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats ... that she'd rather see David Cameron remain as PM.' The note went on to say that Ms Sturgeon had said she did not think Labour leader Ed Miliband was 'prime minister material'. The civil servant added: 'I have to admit that I'm not sure that the FM's tongue would be quite so loose on that kind of thing in a meeting like that, so it might well be a case of something being lost in translation'. Mr Coffinier - who was at the meeting - told Sky News that he had no recollection of Ms Sturgeon's alleged comments. He said: 'I do not know where this comes from, because it is certainly not in my report that anyone gave any preference.' David Cameron, pictured today, said any deal between Labour and the SNP would be a 'chaos alliance' A spokesman for the Ms Bermann said: 'While the Ambassador and First Minister, some time ago, discussed the political situation, Ms Sturgeon did not touch on her personal political preferences with regards to the future prime minister.' Attending an anti-nuclear rally in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: ""This story has already been shown to be 100 per cent untrue - having been comprehensively rejected by both the French Ambassador and Consul General. 'The real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting - which was not even attended by the UK Government - came to be written by a UK Government civil servant and then leaked to Tory-supporting newspapers at the start of a General Election campaign. 'It suggests a Whitehall system out of control - a place where political dirty tricks are manufactured and leaked. And the Foreign Office now appears to be denying the very existence of such a document. Nicola Sturgeon would rather see David Cameron win the election because she does not see Ed Miliband as ‘prime minister material’, it was reported last night. A memo shows that the Scottish first minister told the French ambassador in February she would prefer to see Mr Cameron remain in Downing Street. The document, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say the party would favour another Tory-led Westminster government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to stoke up anti-English sentiment and make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. Written by a senior civil servant, the memo from February 26 states: ‘The first minister confessed that she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM (and didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material).’ She has denied the claims while last night Last night the French consul general told the Guardian that no such views were given by Miss Sturgeon, and 'absolutely no preference was expressed' on the outcome of the general election. 'I am therefore writing to the head of the UK civil service, Sir Jeremy Heywood, requesting an urgent inquiry into the circumstances of such a false account being leaked for transparently political motives.' The SNP leader added: 'Anyone who knows anything about me knows I don't want to see a Conservative government. I'm campaigning to get the Tories out of Downing Street. We've made if very clear that we will lock David Cameron out of Downing Street - the only person who's not made that clear is Ed Miliband. 'We've said that if there are more SNP and Labour MPs than there are Tory MPs, then we will vote to stop a Tory government even getting off the ground. I reissue my challenge to Ed Miliband today to say likewise.' Conservative Culture Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: 'Who knows what the reality is there? I think the one thing that we do know is that the SNP seem to be doing very well in Scotland at the moment ... and it strongly suggests that the only way Ed Miliband could every come into office is in coalition with the SNP and that would mean chaos for Britain.' And a Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband still won't rule out a deal with the SNP because he knows he can't get into Number 10 without them - he's in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon has him on a leash. 'And we know what's in the ransom note: £148 billion more wasteful borrowing, higher taxes on ordinary families, weaker defences and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.' Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'The First Minister might deny reports of her tete-a-tete with the French but we all know a Conservative-only government is the result of this election that the SNP want to see. A Tory PM governing alone in Downing Street and veering to the right fuels nationalist fires back home. 'Despite her fluffy, positive words about working with the rest of the UK we know what she really thinks. Her sole ambition is to break up the UK.' Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, has announced a full investigation into the growing scandal . Ed Miliband, pictured, said he will not enter into any coalition with the SNP as he wants a majority . Mr Miliband described the leaked memo as a 'damning revelation' claiming the SNP were saying one thing in private and something completely different in public. He said: 'I'm very clear that there won't be a coalition with the SNP. That's not going to happen, As for how other parties will end up voting on a Labour Queen's Speech, that's a matter for them. I want a majority Labour government.' Mr Miliband refused to rule out any post-election deal where he would rely on SNP support to prop up a minority government. He added: 'What I'm saying very clearly is we are not going to have a coalition with the SNP. As for other post-election possibilities, I'm not getting into that.' Prime Minister David Cameron joined the row while campaigning in Oxfordshire today. He said: 'There is this coalition of chaos alliance we could end up with if we are not careful - an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain - Labour - and the people who want to break up Britain - the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond. 'That's what we have got to avoid, that big danger of a coalition of chaos that would take our country back.' He claimed Ms Sturgeon's disputed opinion of the Labour leader 'told us something that I said about four years ago - that Ed Miliband is not up to the job of being prime minister. I think we knew that already'.","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon dismissed claims she wants a Tory victory .

9471,"It is exactly a year since Sportsmail revealed that David Moyes was getting the sack at Manchester United, the club deciding to take action as soon as a defeat at Everton meant Champions League qualification was no longer possible. Into his shoes stepped an entirely different character, the supremely confident Louis van Gaal. One year on, JOE BERNSTEIN looks at which man has coped best in the crucial areas of the job, with the pressure of trying to continue Sir Alex Ferguson's success at Old Trafford weighing heavily. David Moyes waved goodbye to Manchester United exactly a year ago after a dismal run of results . Louis van Gaal has propelled United back into the top four, despite an up-and-down season . RESULTS . For David Moyes to take a team that had won the Premier League title by 11 points into seventh place was an unmitigated disaster, even if he coped well with his first Champions League campaign and reached the quarter-finals. United lost seven of their 19 league games at Old Trafford – unacceptable. Under Louis van Gaal, United have already won more league points than they did last season and there are still five matches left. There has been the occasional blip, like losing twice to Swansea City, but the bigger the match, they better they've done, which is how United are meant to be. Two results stand out in particular. Under Moyes, United lost 3-0 at home to their biggest rivals Liverpool and Manchester City. In the corresponding fixtures this season, they have won 3-0 and 4-2. Moyes 4/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . United reflect on another low point last season after Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich . There is a different vibe around Old Trafford now, as seen in the 4-1 win over Manchester City this month . PERFORMANCES . Neither manager plays the same way as Ferguson, whose response when lesser teams came to Old Trafford was to try and overwhelm them with attacking play, based on the use of wingers. Moyes is a more cautious manager, prioritising his defence and it left United fans chanting: 'Come on David Moyes, play like Fergie's boys'. Van Gaal has also been criticised for building play too slowly, he likes to keep possession as a tool for eventually killing off the opposition, death by a thousand passes. But funnily enough that criticism has subsided as the results have improved. Under Moyes, United looked great in some away games, particularly hitting Newcastle for four at St James' Park. But they fell short in the big matches. United got lucky at Arsenal and Southampton earlier in the season, but the showing in the Manchester derby a fortnight ago was a lot more vibrant. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . Juan Mata scored twice as United enjoyed a 4-0 win at Newcastle, a rare good show under Moyes . Robin van Persie's double helped United scrape a lucky win at Southampton in December . DECISIONS . David Moyes got himself into a pickle before he'd even started by appearing ambiguous over whether he was a Robin van Persie man or a Wayne Rooney man. The result was the pair failed to link up in any meaningful way. Having spent £27million on Marouane Fellaini, he deployed him too deep, and failed to get the best out of experienced players Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and Ryan Giggs. Van Gaal comes across as a man who knows what he wants but a defensive injury crisis early on seemed to make him lurch from one formation to another. Rooney was also shunted around from attack to midfield which didn't get the best out of him. Ironically, it was Van Gaal's decision to push a Moyes signing, Fellaini, forward which proved the key to turning United's season around. Moyes and Van Gaal have both made mistakes but the Dutchman seems to have the strength of personality to correct them in time. He has left big names out like Angel di Maria, Falcao and Robin van Persie. Moyes didn't seem to have the confidence to do that. Making Rooney captain was a Van Gaal plan that has worked. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . Ryan Giggs (left) was one of the senior pros whom Moyes failed to get the best out of . Falcao has been a big disappointment under Van Gaal, but the United boss hasn't been afraid to drop him . SIGNINGS . It's a confusing area because we don't really know who has been responsible for all the signings at United since Ferguson left. One can assume Moyes handpicked Fellaini from Everton and he has been a belated success, but the £37.1million acquisition of Mata looked more like opportunism from Ed Woodward who needed at the time to know he could pull off a big deal. Ander Herrera, signed when Van Gaal was in charge, is regarded more as a Moyes buy - he'd done the homework on the Spaniard. Likewise, Van Gaal can take credit for Daley Blind, whose versatility has come in useful this season, and Marcos Rojo. He admits he had little to do with Herrera or Luke Shaw, and the capture of Falcao was probably driven at boardroom level. The biggest signing, £60million for Di Maria, is interesting. Van Gaal definitely liked him as a winger but the Argentine has been a letdown despite 10 Premier League assists. Moyes definitely scores a higher mark now for his transfer business than he would have scored when he left the club, which is why his supporters are aggrieved he wasn't given a second season. Moyes 6/10; Van Gaal 5/10 . Marouane Fellaini was originally branded a poor signing but Moyes's decision has since been vindicated . Angel di Maria was bought for a British record £60m, but has flopped in his first season at United . RELATIONSHIP WITH PLAYERS . Having worked with Wayne Rooney as a teenager at Everton, Moyes was able to get the striker back onside despite his disappointment at the time of not earning a move to Chelsea. But other senior professionals did not react well to the Scot. Robin van Persie felt he was over-trained, though he was careful not to publicly criticise Moyes, but others like Rio Ferdinand were not shy about voicing complaints over issues like when the team was announced. Ryan Giggs made it clear he preferred a more direct, attacking approach with 'pace and width'. Club captain Nemanja Vidic made his decision to leave during Moyes' tenure. It is hard to know exactly what goes on in the inner sanctum but it does appear Van Gaal is highly respected by his United squad. The attention to detail in training has won over key players like Rooney and Michael Carrick, the midfielder even suggesting the team's new style has been taken on board by the players quicker than the fans have done. Even when the team was struggling, you haven't heard mumblings of discontent in the dressing-room compared to a year ago. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . Moyes endured a fractious relationship with several stars at United, including Van Persie . Wayne Rooney and Van Gaal have formed a strong bond, and the Dutchman has the respect of his squad . PUBLIC RELATIONS . In a sense, Moyes was handed a thankless task, replacing Ferguson as the 'Chosen One'. It did require a strong personality with a thick skin, and unfortunately the Scot failed on both counts. In retrospect, he was too deferential, when he cited the club's tradition for bringing in young players and attacking until the end, it didn't sound right because his strengths lie elsewhere. His admission that he didn't take Van Persie off because he feared the reaction smelt of weakness. Neither was he helped by criticism from club legends Paul Scholes and Gary Neville on television. Because of his c.v., Van Gaal has been able to lay down his markers rather better. He has dealt with the likes of Patrick Kluivert, Xavi and Andres Iniesta and the fans of Bayern Munich and Barcelona so nothing at United was going to frighten him. He has been confident enough to lay down his philosophy, whether popular or unpopular. His biggest error was getting sucked into an argument over long-ball tactics with Sam Allardyce. Moyes 5/10; Van Gaal 7/10 . A banner critical of manager Moyes was flown above Old Trafford during a match against Aston Villa . Van Gaal's glittering CV ensured he had the gravitas needed to take on one of the game's biggest jobs . ESCAPING THE SHADOW OF FERGIE . Having personally anointed Moyes, Ferguson maybe felt subconsciously he should have some influence. He went to nearly all the matches despite having said on retirement he'd travel the world and was put out that Moyes let his backroom team of Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen leave. Certainly, when Moyes was heading out, Fergie knew about it and didn't fight to keep him. Ferguson knows he won't hold any sway over Van Gaal and doesn't even try, which has helped the Dutchman. He rarely goes to games now, and when he does he's definitely regarded as a legendary former manager rather than a backseat driver. Whether he intended to or not, Ferguson's shadow loomed large over Moyes. It's an issue Van Gaal has not had to contend with apart from the fans chanting 'Attack, attack, attack' when the ball is passed back to David de Gea. Moyes 4/10; Van Gaal 6/10 . TOTAL: Moyes 34/70; Van Gaal 44/70 . Sir Alex Ferguson was a regular presence in the stands at Old Trafford during Moyes's rule . Ferguson, pictured speaking with Van Gaal in 1998, knows he does not hold influence over the Dutchman .","Manchester United confirmed David Moyes's sacking on April 22, 2014 .

While Van Gaal has come under criticism for slow-paced play, his focus on possession to defeat opposition whilst Moyes was more defensive has seen United win more points than last season despite some blips. His relationship with the United squad and his public relations skills also scored higher in the report, with Moyes blamed for rubbing senior professionals up the wrong way. However, United’s signings under Van Gaal have merited him a lower score in this report, given Ed Woodward’s apparent role in acquisitions, and players including Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria failing to live up to their reputation.
","A year after David Moyes' sacking from Manchester United, an analysis comparison with his successor, Louis van Gaal, reveals the areas in which Van Gaal has had greater successes. Results, performances, decisions, signings, relationship with players, public relations, and escaping Ferguson's shadow, are all areas analysed, with Van Gaal coming out with an overall higher score. While Moyes' defensive approach and lack of confidence in making decisions or leaving out some big names like Angel di Maria, Falcao or Robin van Persie were criticised, Van Gaal is praised for a better season with more points, better big game results, a strong relationship with players, better control of public relations and loyalty to his football philosophy.

2901,"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

9052,"A red hot Novak Djokovic is being tipped to end Rafa Nadal's stranglehold at Roland Garros in June but the Spaniard dismissed the threat as being no different to those he has faced before. The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open.

6282,"This is the chilling moment a mysterious hairless creature chews its way through a steel cage. The description for the unsettling video - uploaded to YouTube last week by Raymond Yeung – claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. The clawed creature - which some say is a rare bear - can be seen aggressively biting through the cage with a visibly bleeding mouth before ripping the metal wire apart with its limbs. The vision has fuelled heated debates around the species of the ambiguous beast, with a string of different accounts coming to light.

According to the video description, the animal was discovered swimming in Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. It was reportedly fished out of the water by workers from the Department of Drainage, who later captured the animal in a steel cage. The clip has sparked heated debates on Chinese social media site WeiBo, with some users claiming it depicts a 'water monster' from Chinese folklore. Other users alluded to the creature being impacted by pollution, with Shenzhen Reservoir being recently deluged with toxic sewerage that turned parts of the region blood red. Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness.

4099,"The moment a pregnant woman was fatally shot by two Idaho police officers has been revealed in surveillance footage. Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said. When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital.

In the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoption . Shane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.' While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology.

2495,"Two dropped points won’t cause too much damage to Celtic’s title defence — but this draw will have offered encouragement to Inverness Caledonian Thistle ahead of next weekend’s Scottish Cup semi-final against the champions. While Celtic have relentlessly marched towards the title, the shine has come off Caley’s season in recent weeks, with manager John Hughes struggling to find a solution to the problem posed by the sale of top scorer Billy McKay to Wigan in January. Nigerian Edward Ofere has been recruited as a replacement and, although he does not appear to have the same natural predatory instincts as the Northern Irish international, he did pop up in the right place to equalise Leigh Griffiths’ early goal. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . A further sign of the Highlanders’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper Dean Brill to a nasty knee injury but, in truth, neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind. Celtic last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Champions League group stages, with manager Ronny Deila making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two-legged tie with Slovenian champions Maribor. Names like (Filip) Twardzik, (Teemu) Pukki and (Dylan) McGeouch featured on the team-sheet that day, with teenage Irish defender Eoghan O’Connell having the dubious honour of match-winner, his own goal gifting Inverness Caley their 1-0 victory. With Celtic eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible, a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat Partick Thistle in midweek, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown joining Griffiths in the starting line-up. Deila has taken to rotating his strikers of late and Griffiths immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for Hibs en route to picking up the Player of the Year title with the Easter Road club a couple of years ago. Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Brown, restored to the team after suspension — and booked again on Saturday — offered assistance by launching a long pass into the wind. The stiff breeze coming off the Moray Firth was enough to give Griffiths the chance to beat Gary Warren in a race for the ball. By the time the defender had got square, Griffiths had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards. With their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals, the locals cringed — but Inverness rallied and produced an impressive response. Ofere may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of McKay’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this, clearly, was his type of occasion. Before scoring, he had already given Jason Denayer a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the Belgian for the goal. Denayer did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked Ryan Christie’s net-bound effort but Ofere was there to jab home the finish from close range. Few teams have the physicality to match Celtic but Ofere typifies the muscular streak that runs through Hughes’ team, with Warren, Josh Meekings, Warren, Greg Tansey and Ross Draper all quite happy to mix it with the champions. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . In such circumstances, Celtic turn to Brown, and the captain stepped up to the plate, breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep. He was the most impressive performer afield, yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by David Raven, a harsh sanction from referee Craig Thomson, who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty. The Highland team had to overcome a more serious setback, however, when goalkeeper Brill went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as Gary Mackay-Steven moved in. There seemed no ill-intent in the Celtic winger’s challenge but Brill required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Ryan Esson. To his credit, the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half-time to tip over headers from Ambrose and Denayer. Caley dropped deeper as the game wore on, with Deila introducing Kris Commons, Adam Matthews and John Guidetti in a bid to force the issue. Even so, it was Inverness who came on strongly at the end. Raven and Tansey flashed shots over, although ultimately there was nothing to test the capabilities of Craig Gordon in goal.","Leigh Griffiths gave Celtic a third minute lead which lasted only 60 seconds .

9377,"A police officer feared for his life when he fired the final shots in a barrage of bullets that killed two unarmed suspects, a court has heard. Michael Brelo, 31, made his first appearance in court in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. Brelo's attorney Patrick D'Angelo conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that Brelo exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' vehicle. But Brelo and 12 officers who shot a total of 137 rounds into the car in November 2012 had ample reason to believe that Russell and Williams were shooting at them, he said. Self defense? Michael Brelo's attorney opened the case insisting the 31-year-old (pictured today) had reason to believe he was being shot at when he jumped on the car and shot dead Timothy Russell and Melissa Williams . D'Angelo said he wasn't calling what Brelo and the other officers did that night heroic. 'They are simple, ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations,' he said. Brelo, charged with voluntary manslaughter, is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night. A judge will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Rick Bell revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during Brelo's 15-shot volley, something defense attorneys have argued in motions. Bell said a medical examiner has concluded that Brelo fired 'kill shots' into Russell and Williams and that they were still alive when Brelo fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the Malibu, striking Williams 11 times and Russell six times, when they were no longer a threat to anyone. Brelo fired out of a sense of rage and vengeance after he and his partner became one of the first cars to join what would be a 19-mile chase on city streets and freeways with speeds reaching 100 mph, Bell said. Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this Chevy Malibu . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The prosecutor criticized Brelo and others for violating departmental policies that required permission to chase a suspect vehicle. More than 100 Cleveland police officers in five dozen cars were involved in the chase at some point. 'His pursuit of 22 minutes described the final outcome,' Bell said of Brelo. 'He should have never been in that position to begin with.' D'Angelo argued that Officer Wilfredo Diaz, who fired the initial rounds after Russell drove the Malibu toward him, could have killed Russell and Williams. Those shots prompted other officers to begin firing because they believed Russell and Williams were shooting at them. 'These officers were scared to death,' D'Angelo said. 'They thought they were in a gun battle.' The car was strafed by police gunfire after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik  who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators: 'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.","Cleveland, Ohio, officer Michael Brelo is facing two counts of manslaughter .

9191,"Paris Saint-Germain's then sports director Leonardo declared the club were ready for tougher competitions in Europe two years ago but Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final exit suggests they need more time to reach the top. PSG were knocked out 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona despite Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti returning to the Ligue One side but coach Laurent Blanc was not really shocked. 'Those who follow Barcelona know the patience required to win the Champions League. You need the means, but also some patience,' Blanc said after the 2-0 defeat at the Nou Camp, which followed last week's 3-1 humbling at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc looks on as his Paris Saint-Germain side were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona . 'The first qualified for the semi-finals are Barca and Bayern Munich. Paris will certainly be there one day but you have to understand we need time,' he said after PSG's third successive quarter-final exit in the tournament. Once again, Sweden striker Ibrahimovic failed to shine in a big game in which his attacking partner Edinson Cavani, despite his limitations, seemed more involved. PSG saw off Chelsea in the previous round but that was more of a one-tie thing, with Thiago Silva and David Luiz scoring after Ibrahimovic had been sent off in the second leg. Luiz was below-par in the last two games, being at fault on four of the five goals PSG conceded against Barca, but PSG's problems are collective, conceded midfielder Blaise Matuidi. Blaise Matuidi says that PSG are still not ready to win the Champions League and still have work to do . David Luiz was given a torrid time over the two legs and was at fault for four of Barcelona's goals . 'Barcelona are an institution, a club who have been at the top level for a long time, like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich,' the France international said. 'We have been around for five years only.' PSG were bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), who invested massively in the club hoping to win Europe's premium club competition. While they never look threatened in the Group stage, PSG have been failing against top-notch opposition. 'Let's be realistic, they were better than us. They will probably win the Champions League,' Ibrahimovic admitted. Star men Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) and Marco Verratti were unable to influence the game in PSG's favour .

3683,"Small, brown and infinitely snackable, the almond seems so inoffensive. And yet just as this latest health food is supposed to be transforming our lives, battling high cholesterol and heart attacks, it is having a ruinous effect on the planet. The nut that frequently appears in the Bible as a symbol of fruitfulness and promise has been dubbed ‘the Devil’s nut’, pinpointed as the chief culprit in an eco-disaster that is developing in California. The so-called Golden State is increasingly turning a dirty brown colour due to a devastating drought that is in its fourth year. Although it’s tempting to blame all those irresponsible Californians filling their huge swimming pools and watering their lawns with abandon, domestic water consumption is dwarfed by that of agriculture. Bone dry: A Californian farmer is pictured surveying his drought-hit land in San Luis Obispo County . The state has long been one of the world’s biggest producers of fruit and vegetables — for profit-hungry farmers, its year-round sunshine more than outweighs the obvious drawback that it hardly ever rains there. Californian farmers have been allowed to hog dwindling supplies of water, digging ever-deeper bore holes to keep the rest of us stocked up with all-year-round peaches, sweet peppers and pistachios. And all would still have been fine if it hadn’t been for the addition of almonds. The trouble is, global demand for the nut is soaring — as customers from David Cameron to millions of middle-class Chinese develop a passion for almond-based foods. The Prime Minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea. And it almost certainly comes from California. Attracted by the huge profits being made from a crop that is hardly cheap, California farmers now satisfy 84 per cent of the world’s almond demand. Worth £3.8 billion in 2013, almonds have become California’s second biggest agricultural commodity after milk, as demand has exploded by 1,000 per cent in a decade. The problem is that almonds guzzle water on a monumental scale. It has been calculated that it takes 1.1 gallons of water to grow a single almond. Worse, they need water all the year round, so almond trees must be watered even when they are not producing. Dry days: Homes with swimming pools are seen in the Palm Springs area, California, as the state enters its fourth year of severe drought . Since almond trees cover almost a million acres of California (about the size of Cornwall) — many of them on previously virgin hillsides or in areas with little or no rain — that’s a lot of H2O being sucked up to satisfy our almond craving. In total, almonds are annually consuming 1.07 trillion gallons of water in the state — a fifth more than the entire indoor water usage of all 39 million Californians. All of which is slightly problematic, given that two-thirds of California is classified as being in ‘extreme drought’, as the region suffers its driest conditions for 1,200 years. U.S. government weather experts are talking about a mega-drought that could last for decades. The state’s governor, Jerry Brown, last month ordered cities and towns to slash their water consumption by at least a quarter and by as much as 35 per cent in some urban areas. Residents have been told to take shorter showers and to stop watering their lawns. Owners of swimming pools — the icon of the California lifestyle — are being banned from filling them in some neighbourhoods. But the governor’s decision to exempt farms from his draconian measure has infuriated voters, who quickly identified who was really to blame. One TV station has talked about ‘almond shaming’, while the Los Angeles Times outed them as the ‘villains’ of the super-drought. Some almond farmers have tried to shift the blame. ‘The tomato growers use a lot more water than we do,’ says one, Ryon Paton, but no one believes him. Almonds are high in potassium, calcium, vitamin E and magnesium, and are thought to reduce cholesterol and decrease hunger without leading to weight gain . The hunt is on for celebrity almond investors, amid reports that both Oprah Winfrey and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are making huge sums from almond farms. Almond farmers are also fighting among themselves. Smaller growers are blaming the big companies moving into the market, saying they are growing almonds in areas that are too dry for the trees. Because farmers have to irrigate almond trees continuously, they are using groundwater — the underground water that feeds aquifers and theoretically provides the state’s emergency reserves. Groundwater supplies have been shrinking for decades, but the mega-rich, big almond growers can afford to sink bore holes more than 100ft to find the precious liquid. So is the state of California, birthplace of Sixties’ hippy values, rushing to root up almond groves and rescue its corner of the planet? Quite the opposite. In America, dollar signs are everything. A recent government survey found that 77 per cent of California almond farmers plan to plant more trees. They have the support of the state’s leaders who get vast sums in taxes from such a high-value crop. Paul Wenger, head of the California Farm Bureau, says any talk of curbing almond growing ‘gets to be kind of un-American. It’s a free country and they have the right to do what they want’. Unlike cows' milk, almond milk – which is made from ground nuts and water – has no cholesterol or lactose, and being a plant food, it is often consumed by vegans, vegetarians, and others forgoing dairy . California has been bingeing on water for decades, building homes in arid areas that shouldn’t be inhabited — as their owners discover when they are engulfed in bushfires. Farming is governed by the same ‘who cares’ attitude. America has vast amounts of rich agricultural land in god-forsaken states like Iowa, but California has a Mediterranean climate that’s ideal for high-profit crops like almonds. If Californians won’t save themselves, an obvious solution is for everyone else to stop buying their almonds. But weaning ourselves off something hailed a ‘miracle food’ could be tough. The average American snacks on 2lb of almonds a year. Britain is catching up fast. UK almond milk sales are soaring at a rate of 70-80 per cent a year as shoppers opt for a dairy-free alternative that they believe is healthier for your heart and the perfect solution to the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance. Last year, Sainsbury’s reported its sales were up by 181 per cent year-on-year. A study in the British Medical Journal even challenged the ‘benefit’ of dairy milk, saying it not only fails to prevent bone fractures but may double the risk of early death. For almond milk producers there could be no better sales pitch. But do the PM and his trendy friends know it takes 23 gallons of water to produce a glass of almond milk? The Prime Minister is said to splash almond milk on his breakfast cereal and in his tea. And it almost certainly comes from California . Nutrition experts see the almond as meeting an increasing demand for a natural, low-calorie and high-protein food that tastes more pleasant than that old health shop stalwart, soya. It’s more versatile, too — almond butter can be spread on toast like peanut butter, ground into flour and nibbled as a snack. Nuts may have a reputation as being fattening but almond fans say they are packed with antioxidants and healthy fats that help modulate blood sugar and reduce hunger. The list of reputed benefits goes on and on. Perhaps it is not surprising, given that almonds are mentioned in the Book of Genesis as ‘among the best of fruits’. The rod of Aaron — brother of Moses — supposedly brought forth fragrant almond flowers. But if there’s a smell in the air in California, it is the stench of greed — as America’s most self-indulgent state pours away its fast-vanishing water to feed a global obsession with a humble nut.","Global demand soaring as people develop passion for almond-based foods .

However, the nut guzzles water on a monumental scale. It takes 1.1 gallons of water to produce a single almond, and since almond trees are grown on almost a million acres of California land, that consumes vast amounts of water.  It has been estimated that in California alone, almonds are annually consuming 1.07tn gallons of water, a fifth more than the entire indoor water usage of all 39 million Californians.","The growing global demand for almonds, particularly from China and the UK, is causing increasing environmental damage in California, with almond trees consuming around 1.1 gallons of water to grow just one nut, and needing ongoing water. As such, the trees are exacerbating the drought that has hit California for a fourth year, and the state’s almond growers reportedly use more water than the country's entire population of people and businesses. California produces 84% of the world’s almonds, with the nut becoming its second most valuable agricultural commodity after milk, worth $3.8bn in 2013, but demand has grown by 1,000% in the last decade. The global almond industry was worth $4.4bn last year. One American government survey suggested 77% of Californian almond farmers planned to plant more trees, backed by the state’s leadership, which receives vast sums of revenue from high-value almond crops."
6280,"The company which owns the Hogwarts Express and offers steam train excursions across some of Britain’s most picturesque routes has been temporarily banned from operating following the ‘most serious’ case of a near collision so far this year. Services by West Coast Railways have been suspended following the incident on March 7 in which a train failed to stop at a signal. According to reports, a 100mph collision between a steam excursion and a First Great Western high speed train was missed by barely a minute. Scroll down for video . Fanfare: Actor Mark Williams aka Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter films, unveils the Hogwarts Express train at The Harry Potter Studio tour at Leavesden, where it is business as usual this Easter. But West Coast Railways, which own the train that was used in the films, have had services suspended after near miss . The nationwide ban by Network Rail is the first since privatisation, indicating the gravity of the incident. WCR, based in Carnforth, Lancashire, owns a fleet of steam locomotives including Olton Hall, the train used as the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The 78-year-old steam train that operated throughout the film franchise was installed at a new extension of the Harry Potter tour at Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden last month. Platform 9 ¾, which gives Harry Potter fans the chance to climb aboard the train’s carriage and to pose with a luggage trolley as it disappears through the platform wall, is operating as normal. The Network Rail ban means chartered services, including those on the West Highland Line taking in Fort William, and Settle to Carlisle line in the Yorkshire Dales, cannot run until May 15. In the meantime WCR needs to take a number of steps to address Network Rail’s concerns. The suspension notice states: ‘Network Rail has had concerns about WCR’s performance of its safety obligations for some time, and recent events lead Network Rail to believe that the operations of WCR are a threat to the safe operation of the railway.’ Network Rail told RAIL magazine that WCR had ‘demonstrated that its controls, communication and commitment following the recent [incident] were inadequate’. 'This ranked as the most serious Signal Passed at Danger SPAD that has taken place this year when the industry risk ranking methodology was applied.'","West Coast Railways services suspended after train failed to stop at signal .

3558,"It was the maths problem designed for 14-year-olds that baffled people around the world. For those who did not manage to work out the cryptic clues that were designed to lead them towards the fictional Cheryl's birthday, then the answer was July 16. Those who were able to reason their way to this answer followed a series of logical steps that allowed them to rule out the other dates given as part of the question. The question, 'So when is Cheryl’s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. At first, it appears impossible to answer without more information but pictured is the method used to work it out . The question, 'So when is Cheryl’s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. It asked: Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15 and August 17. Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. The puzzle asked: Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates. May 15, May 16,  May 19 . June 17, June 18 . July 14, July 16 . August 14, August 15, August 17 . Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is. So when is Cheryl’s birthday? Albert said: 'I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard said: 'At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now.' Albert said: 'Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.' To reach the answer, it is possible to work through the information both men known to rule out nine of the dates in a number of steps. First, we know Cheryl has already told Albert the month of her birthday, and Bernard the day. Each of the men does not know what the other has been told. So, for Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard cannot know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday cannot possibly be in May or June. This is because in the months of May and June there are numbers (dates) that only occur once across the four months - namely May 19 and June 18. If Albert had been given May or June as the month, there is no way he could be sure Bernard did not already know the birthday as  Bernard might have been the number 18 or 19. For Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard doesn't know, Albert must have been given a month that does not contain one of these 'unique' dates - i.e. July or August. The problem was posted on Facebook by ‘Hello Singapore’ television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8 (stock image of exam room shown) Albert's disclosure now gives Bernard the clue he needs to work out the birthday for himself. Bernard only knows the number of Cheryl’s birthday, but from Albert’s statement he has now also ruled out both May and June. This is because he realises Albert has ruled out May and June because of the 'single number' aspect above. As Bernard says he knows the date, we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate. If Cheryl had told Bernard that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month, then he could not have worked out the date at this stage. However, as he states that he now knows the date, we can rule out July 14 or August 14. This leaves just three dates to chose from - July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. Following Bernard's statement, Albert is then apparently also able to deduce the date of Cheryl's birthday. This means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told. Given that there are two dates left in August and one in July, it has to be the July date. So the answer is July 16. Organisers of SASMO said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants. This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, China and the UK took the test .

3906,"A greedy mother who told a 13-year-old volunteer to 'f*** off' was evicted from a family Easter egg hunt after she took more than her fair share of chocolate treats. The woman in her mid- to late 30s, who is believed to have had two or three children participating, was at Melbourne’s Greatest Ever Easter Egg Hunt, which was run by Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation at Caulfield Racecourse on Saturday. She was escorted out of the racecourse, in Melbourne's south-east, when she became 'irate' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many Easter eggs. Scroll down for video . A greedy mother at a charity Easter egg hunt was booted out of the event after she swore at volunteers . Event organiser Allan Turner said gluttonous parents were a major problem at the event who took in additional bags and even prams to fill up with chocolate. The aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation, while raising money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation. More than 2,500 chocolate lovers paid $5 to fill up their bucket with as many eggs as they could fit on Saturday. 'This is the fourth year we've done the event and we have problems with parents sneaking in shopping bags and filling them up to the top,' Mr Turner told Daily Mail Australia. She was told by a 13-year-old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to 'f*** off' The woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in . 'Parents are the toughest ones to control. You expect the kids to go frantic and shove eggs into their pockets and shirts and pants. But when parents go past this level of gluttony, it’s not a good look.' Mr Turner said they had to create a pram parking area outside the hunting spot to stop adults from smuggling eggs out by hiding them inside baby carriages. But he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by Hillier's Chocolates. He said one of volunteers approached him on the day and told him a woman was throwing obscenities at her when they asked her to stop stuffing multiple bags full with treats. '[The woman] was saying ""I've not done it""... [but] she had definitely filled up a number of bags to the hilt, more than people paying $5 a bucket,' Mr Turner said. 'She got irate and started carrying on and started having a go at my young volunteer who was only 13 years old. 'She was using the f-word, saying ""You can't stop from f***ing doing this and f*** off"".' It was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out . The egg hunt looks to raise money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation, which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront . It was started by Zaidee Turner's father, Allan, who wanted to honour his seven-year-old daughter who was an organ donor when she died . Mr Turner said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event, which he had started in the honour of his daughter, Zaidee, who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old. He said Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation. At the time of her death, Mr Turner said Zaidee was one of the youngest people in Victoria to be on the donor list, saving the lives of up to seven people. Zaidee (not pictured) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt . Mr Turner said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible . Organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs . 'We try to [do events] left of field for organ and tissue donation,' he said. 'We've had jockey breeches with rainbow stripes on the side, we've done that for a number of years where [jockeys] wear them at race events and we came up with the idea of Melbourne's Greatest Easter Egg Hunt. 'It's Melbourne’s biggest Easter egg hunt and it raises much needed funds in an area where there are benefits for young and old.'","Mother was at charity Easter egg hunt at Melbourne's Caulfield Racecourse .

7951,"Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season .

Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence.

He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said.

3155,"A Nebraska man has found an innovative way to make his Craigslist ad stand out by shooting a commercial for the car he is trying to sell. Django Greenblatt-Seay, 33, said he decided to make the video for the 2002 Ford Taurus, which he is selling for $3,000, because he thought it would help spike people's interest. 'While the 2002 Ford Taurus is a fine car, it's not exactly exciting with just a couple of photos on Craigslist on its own,' he told the Daily Mail Online. 'I thought I would add a little flair to it, plus I was bored on a Sunday.' Django Greenblatt-Seay, 33, made a Craigslist ad for his 2002 Ford Taurus stand out by filming a commercial for the car he is selling for $3,000 . Greenblatt-Seay used a drone to film this cinematic overhead shot at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska . The video begins from far overhead, showcasing the silver car as just a speck among the vast expanse of trees at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska. Greenblatt-Seay used his drone, a DJI Inspire 1 model, to capture the cinematic effect before dramatically zooming in on the car's tires, headlights, dashboard and seats like a classic car commercial. Perhaps the best effect of the ad is that it is soundtracked with an old-fashioned 1987 Ford Taurus commercial.

4719,"What started out as a harmless April Fools Day prank  turned out to be anything but funny when the joke resulted in a fire at an apartment near a college campus Wednesday. Units from multiple fire departments were called to a fire  just west of Grand Valley State University in Michigan after an April Fools prank involving fireworks sent one apartment unit up in smoke, the Holland Sentinel reports. Four girls live in Apartment 4 of Building B of the Campus West Apartments. Fire officials said one of the girls threw a lit firework at a roommate; the firework landed in a laundry hamper, setting the contents on fire. April Fools: An April Fools Day prank went horribly wrong when a joke involving fireworks led to an apartment fire (photographed) near Grand Valley State University in Michigan . Fireworks: Fire officials said one of the apartment building's residents threw a lit firework at a roommate; the firework landed in a laundry hamper, setting the contents on fire . No one was hurt, Fox reports, and the girl is not expected to face charges. One of the girls' neighbors, Addison Walstra, 19, told the Sentinel that her neighbors came to her apartment and she had given them a fire extinguisher -- the units are not required to have fire extinguishers because they are townhomes. 'The fire was too big for [the extinguisher] so they told us to get out and then we knocked on everybody else's doors to get them out as well,' Walstra said, describing the moment her neighbors returned to her apartment to tell her they could not put out the fire. Firefighters arrived at around 9.30am and the building was evacuated. The fire was contained to the upper-level of the building, the Sentinel reports. Contained: Firefighters arrived at around 9.30am and the building was evacuated; he fire was contained to the upper-level of the building . Damage: Allison Mitchell (photographed), who lives in a neighboring apartment, said her room had smoke damage . Capt. Dave Pelton with the Allendale Fire Rescue said firewalls prevented the fire from spreading to neighboring apartments and Fox reports that the fire was extinguished at around 9.45am. '[The residents] were lucky, we had a great response and everyone was able to make it out safely,' Pelton told MLive. Sarah Long, who lives in a neighboring apartment told MLive that she heard the smoke alarm and someone crying before residents told her and her roommates to leave the building. 'It's just an April Fools gone wrong..' Long said. 'It was supposed to be funny, and, now it's not.' The apartment residents are allowed to return to two of the six apartments in the building, WOOD-TV reports. The remaining students, except for Apartment 4's residents, are expected to be able to return later Wednesday.

3676,"Johanna Basford, 32, has released a colouring book for adults which has sold 226,000 in one month . A colouring book has become a sell-out success thanks to an unusual twist – it is designed for adults. Since British artist Johanna Basford created one of the first colouring books for grown-ups in 2013, called Secret Garden, it has sold over 1.5million copies and inspired a flurry of similar books. Now, the 32-year-old’s second book Enchanted Forest has sold out within weeks of its release. Some 226,000 copies were scooped up last month and the publishers have now printed another 250,000. Enchanted Forest reached number one on the UK Amazon book chart at the start of April, while the two books took first and second place on Amazon’s bestsellers list for the US. Mother-of-one Miss Basford, from Aberdeen, said she has been contacted by people from all walks of life who enjoy her ‘stress-relieving’ books, from artists to investment bankers. She said colouring books were no longer viewed as ‘childish’ and instead allowed everyone to express their creative side. She added: ‘I think it has been a bit of an underground movement for a long time. ‘People have always loved colouring because it is a very accessible way of unleashing your creative side. But I think it was seen as childish. By creating adult books, with more intricate designs, it makes it more socially acceptable. 'It is a book of artwork geared towards an adult audience.’ The artist, who is married to James Watt – the owner of craft beer company BrewDog – said adults had been enjoying children’s colouring books for years but had been sheepish about admitting it. Miss Basford said she had been stunned by the response to her books, which will soon have sold close to 2million copies and been translated into 14 languages. She previously did commercial work designing packaging and perfume bottles, but now focuses almost full-time on her colouring books. She said: ‘It started as a selfish pursuit to create a book that I loved. I didn’t do any market research. ‘We initially printed 13,000 copies and I honestly thought my mum was going to have buy a lot of books just to save face.’ Enchanted Forest, the mother-of-one's second release, reached number one on the UK Amazon book chart at the start of April, while the two books took first and second place on Amazon’s bestsellers list for the US . The designer studied textiles at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee, but focused on drawing after graduating. Several years later, she came up with the idea of a whimsical colouring book for adults after her clients said her black and white designs would be perfect for colouring. It took her nine months to design her first book, which she juggled in between commercial assignments for companies such as Absolut Vodka, Sony and Nike. She said she now receives thousands of pictures from fans who want to show off their colouring in, adding: ‘It is a really inclusive activity. ‘I have heard from artists who can no longer do their original discipline for health reasons but still want to be creative, and from people recuperating from an illness who find it therapeutic. ‘It is stress-relieving. People using the books include investment bankers, academics and lots of people in finance. Colouring lets you lose yourself in your own bubble.’","Johanna Basford released Secret Garden in 2013 which sold 1.5m copies .

4069,"Stevie McCrorie has been crowned the winner of The Voice UK 2015, after beating fellow contestant Lucy O'Byrne in the final. Now mentor Ricky Wilson, his fellow celebrity judges Rita Ora, Tom Jones and Will.i.am, and most of all bosses at the BBC will all have their fingers crossed for his success. Because it's not just a hit single Stevie needs, he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts. Scroll down for video . Can this year's The Voice UK champion Stevie McCrorie break the winners' curse? His mentor Ricky Wilson is confident Stevie could be just what the BBC needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule . Leanne Mitchell, the first ever winner of The Voice UK, has been dropped by her record label and now works as a holiday camp performer. The very job she was hoping to leave behind when first auditioning for the show . Series one winner Leanne Mitchell, mentored to success in 2012 by Sir Tom Jones, blew everyone away with her version of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You in the live final. But despite much excitement surrounding her first single, she failed to rank any higher than number 45 in the music charts. Then a year later came her album, a record of songs written entirely by her rather than a compilation of cover versions, which failed to chart in the top 100. Some, including The Script frontman and former Voice coach Danny O'Donoghue, believe Leanne didn't have the right work ethic. When asked last year about Leanne's flop, he said, 'I was told by Tom Jones, and by the label as well, that Leanne just did not want to work as hard as you have to work to be a pop star.' Leanne won the public vote in the final of The Voice UK's first ever series, but her debut single, a cover of Whitney Houston's I Would Run To You only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . Leanne Mitchell has now returned to her previous employment, singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk, after failing to make her mark on the music industry . After being dropped by her label Decca, Leanne is now working in the job she thought she'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at Potters Leisure Resort in Hopton-On-Sea, Norfolk. The singer has defended her efforts, suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she'd finished writing her album. But can the same be said for series two winner, Andrea Begley? Former The Voice UK coach Danny O'Donoghue criticised Leanne Mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the BBC talent show, but has failed to make his own winning act, Andrea Begley, who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013,  into a household name either . Partially sighted Irish singer Andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor Leanne, but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal, she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other TV talent shows like Simon Cowell's The X Factor . The partially sighted singer from Pomeroy, Northern Ireland, now 29, won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow Irishman, Danny. She even commented on the failings of her predecessor Leanne, and said that she was determined to do things differently. 'Everybody is obviously aware that last year things didn't go maybe as well as they could've done, and I think lessons have been learned,' she told the Mirror, shortly after being crowned champ. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the singer's disappointment . But while Andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal, her success hasn't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like The X Factor might bring. Her debut single, a cover of Evanescence's My Immortal, charted at number 30, while her follow up, Dancing In The Dark, originally by Bruce Springsteen, didn't make it any further than 113. Andrea's album, The Message, released in October 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts, but compare that to the success of most X Factor winners, and you soon understand the deflation in the Begley camp. Will.i.am won the third series of The Voice UK with Jermain Jackman, a young singer from Hackney, London . 2014 The Voice winner Jermain saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at just number 75 . Hot on the heels of Andrea was Jermain Jackman, who won last year's series with coach Will.i.am. If a slow start killed Leanne Mitchell's chances, Jermain and Will had better kick this career into gear. The singer from Hackney in London, still just 20-years-old, saw his debut single And I Am Telling You, a cover of the Broadway number made famous by Jennifer Hudson in musical Dreamgirls, chart at number 75. Despite various public appearances, once with Mitch Winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter Amy Winehouse, Jermain's debut album this month has landed at number 42. Compared with X Factor's 2014 winner Ben Haenow, whose debut single landed the Christmas number one spot, Jermain's success has so far been what you could call limited.

The glitter falls from the ceiling...but the real hard work is just beginning for Stevie McCrorie . So can Stevie McCrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of The Voice UK? His debut single will be Lost Stars, a cover of Adam Levine's hit from the film Begin Again, which was nominated for an Oscar this year. The Scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival T in The Park already. Stevie's coach Ricky Wilson, frontman of rock band Kaiser Chiefs, has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism. When asked if he's worried about the growing number of The Voice UK flops, he simply replied, 'Stevie hasn't won it before.' So now it's all eyes on you Stevie! No pressure... Though it's not always the winners who reap all the success (Steve Brookstein, case in point), the X Factor has produced far more chart successes than The Voice UK. Here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from Simon Cowell's ITV show: . One Direction They didn't win, in fact they came third, runners up next to Matt Cardle and Rebecca Ferguson in 2010, but Simon Cowell's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally, taken over the world with their legion of fans. Leona Lewis Despite having left Simon Cowell's label Sycon last year, Leona remains one of the show's biggest successes, having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win. JLS The runners-up of the 2009 series, JLS went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums, before splitting up in 2013. Olly Murs He came second to Joe McElderry in 2009, then went on to sell almost as many albums as JLS and co-present the X Factor's sister show Xtra Factor in ITV2 with Caroline Flack. Alexandra Burke After winning the 2009 series following her duet with Beyonce, Alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single Hallelujah. James Arthur Before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile Twitter rants, he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single Impossible after winning the 2012 series. Little Mix The first ever group to win the show in 2011, Little Mix have now beaten The Spice Girls' chart success in America and raked up an impressive 132million VEVO views. Rebecca Ferguson Though she came second to Matt Cardle in the 2010 series, Rebecca has just released her third album Lady Sings The Blues and has enjoyed steady chart success.","Leanne Mitchell has been dropped by her label and sings at a holiday camp .

6773,"An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed. The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal’s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is £26billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'","Drug called AZDO5030 originally designed to treat certain types of tumour .

The Sports Direct tycoon owns 9.82 per cent of the Glasgow giants but is prohibited from going over 10 per cent by an agreement struck with Hampden chiefs designed to limit his power at Ibrox. But that did not stop Ashley exerting influence. Two of his closest associates - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - sat as directors until King forced them out at last month's general meeting. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley bought a 9.8 per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5million . Ashley gave the club's old board a £5million loan in January which remains outstanding. That agreement gives the 50-year-old a floating charge on the club as well as security on a number of assets, including Murray Park and the club's registered trademarks.

Ashley's close associate Derek Llambias sat as director as Ashley exerted his influence .

4118,"Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T. Despite his newest models being nearly 90 years old, the businessman, from Buckinghamshire, is selling one every week, including to the TV and film industry who have used then in shows such as Downton Abbey. Mr Tuckett says his customers love the Model T - the first affordable mass-produced car - because they don't require need road tax or an MOT and are cheaper to maintain than a modern car, with each one selling for  around £10,000. Scroll down for video . Toot: Second-hand car dealer Neil Tuckett (pictured) has turned his back on the modern vehicle and only sells Henry Ford's famous Model T . Top of the range: This 1914 model is £24,750 and is one of around one a week sold by the Buckinghamshire dealer . Yours for £13,500: this 1917 Model T is on the market and like all the classic cars they don't require road tax or a MOT . Back to basics: Some of the vehicles need to have their headlamps lit by match, left, and right are the rudimentary pedals for braking, accelerating and changing gear . But with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast and some of his pre-1915 model have gas headlights still lit by a match. Mr Tuckett, 58, has customers who use them as wedding cars and even one that is used as a hearse. He discovered his passion for the model when he got a call from his great uncle, John Brazil, asking him to accompany him on the London to Brighton commercial run - an event for historic commercial vehicles. He had a Model T van, previously used for transporting sausages and pies to London, and Neil had driven it once in a field before he got behind the wheel in Hyde Park for the event. He continued maintaining the vehicle afterwards and his great uncle left the van to him when he died. The agricultural engineer started his own business in 1984 but when the work dried up a few years later, his team turned their attention to Model Ts..

Neil said: 'We're a niche market specialist and I've got about 100 years of man experience of Model Ts with my team. 'We do about one a week, 50 a year. They're coming in here as fast as I can fix them. There's about 3,000 in the UK and we look after a good proportion of those. 'It was a very popular car. At one point, half the cars in the world were Model Ts. They're affordable, usable and repairable, even though they are 100 years old. 'It's more leisurely than a modern car. Its cruising speed is 30mph, at 40mph you're starting to rattle and to hit 45mph you'd have to be going downhill with the wind behind you. 'But it's cheaper to maintain than a modern car. The insurance costs about £50 a year, you don't need road tax or an MOT and there are no major expenses.

Meticulous: Mr Tuckett sources his Ford spares from all over the globe and carefully puts the machines back together again. Behind the wheel: The second-hand car dealer says that beauty of the Model is how simple and enjoyable it is to drive . Sales pitch: Mr Tuckett says: 'They're like a giant meccano set really, and so beautifully simple and reliable they just won't let you down. You also don't require road tax or and MOT' 'There's probably 20 companies in the world making new parts for the Model T and about 80 per cent of Model Ts are new parts now, but they don't make new chassis. 'The main source of original parts is America, 14million were built there. The parts are all affordable and there's no electrics so little to go wrong. 'And everyone seems to remember them, they know what a Model T is. That's quite surprising after 100 years, it's an iconic car. 'They're lots of fun. I'm about to go to Scotland with a Model T4 group - there's ten of us touring for a week in the Outer Hebrides. 'I've seen a lot of the UK that I would never have seen if I wasn't driving an old car.' Thing of beauty: The Model T is an icon, but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers cannot get anywhere very fast . Germans may have invented the petrol engine, but it was Henry Ford, a Michigan-Irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential. Ford said he had to invent his ‘gasoline buggy’ to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the United States. The Model T was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car. In total more than 15million were made. The first Model Ts were fairly expensive, about £500. But by the early 1920s, when millions were being produced, the price had dropped to about £125, which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage. Ford was obsessed with efficiency: his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of Chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the United states . His famous decree that customers could choose ‘any colour so long as it is black’ was not to limit consumer choice, but to reduce costs. In Ford’s day, freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry. Black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper. By 1914, a Model T could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the Sears Roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves.","Neil Tuckett's  newest model on his forecourt is  90 years old - but he is still selling one Model T every week .

528,"(CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, on Saturday to death by hanging, along with 13 members of his group. The sentences will be appealed. The criminal court sentenced 36 other defendants to life in prison on charges of plotting terrorist attacks against state facilities. They faced charges that include ""funding the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in"" -- a mass protest in Cairo in August 2013 that was forcibly dispersed by security personnel -- and spreading ""false information"" to destabilize Egypt. They were arrested in a sweeping crackdown on supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, who was overthrown in 2013 in a military coup that bitterly split Egyptians. One of those sentenced to life in prison was Mohamad Soltan, a 27-year-old U.S.-Egyptian activist. He has been languishing in Cairo's notorious Tora Prison, where he has been on a hunger strike for more than 14 months. The U.S. State Department released a statement condemning Soltan's sentence and calling for his release on humanitarian grounds. The presiding judge for Badie, Soltan and the other defendants was Mohamed Nagy Shehata, who is known for his harsh verdicts. Shehata has sentenced more than 180 people to death and was the original judge in a high-profile case case involving Al Jazeera journalists. Badie had been sentenced to death before on a conviction related to a deadly attack on a police station. He has also been sentenced to life in prison for inciting violence during 2013's unrest. The Egyptian news outlet Al Ahram reported that Badie had been sentenced to death twice before, but an appeals court overturned one verdict, and Egypt's Grand Mufti disapproved of the other. During the summer of unrest, hundreds of people died when the police forcefully cleared camps set up by protesting Morsy supporters and when security forces opened fire on Morsy backers who attacked police stations, government buildings and churches. The government accused the protesters of inciting violence. After the coup, the new government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy was arrested, and he too faces trial. Soltan's sister, Hanaa, is anxious about what the future holds for her family. She wrote a letter to her brother expressing her feelings. ""Dear Mohamed,"" the letter read. ""I'm often asked why, and how, you've kept up your hunger strike for 14 months now, despite our pleas for you to end it. I've watched your body go from a plump basketball-playing frame to one that has withered down to its bones. ""Your face, with its beautiful smile often grinning, now looks permanently in pain. And, all I can do to explain is to tell people that it's the only form of control you have to hold on to -- now more than ever, on the eve of your sentencing.""

7001,"Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form. Gers suffered the first defeat of new boss Stuart McCall's six-game reign on Thursday night as they slumped 3-0 at Queen of the South. It was an especially flat display after the high of recent Scottish Championship victories over Hearts and Hibernian. Kenny Miller fears Rangers' promotion bid could be derailed by the Ibrox side's rollercoaster run of form . The Light Blues - who remain behind the Easter Road side in third place on goal difference - now have five games left, starting with Raith on Sunday, to leapfrog Hibs and spare themselves the effort of playing two extra ties in the play-offs. Finish third and they could even be sent back to Palmerston - where they have now lost twice this season - for another testing clash with Queens, provided James Fowler's side see off Falkirk in the race for fourth. But the worry for striker Miller is that Gers' lack of consistency could wreck their chance of a Premiership return. The 35-year-old said: 'Last night was a reminder that we have not turned the corner and that there's a lot of hard work still to be done. Miller (centre) looks dejected as his Rangers side slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Queen of the South . 'It was a performance that summed up out season a little bit. That 'consistency' word has come up a lot this year. 'We seem to have a couple of good performances and then complacency kicks in and we take our foot of the gas. 'If we go back three games to the Hibs result, I don't think anyone could have seen that coming. Fast forward three games and I don't think anyone could have seen the result last night coming. 'We have to nail down that consistency and get to a level of performance that we can pretty much guarantee every week. Rangers had recently secured victories over Scottish Championship rivals Hearts and Hibernian . 'Might this inconsistency come back to haunt us in the play-offs? It could do, yes. 'There is no point winning 1-0 or 2-0 at home and losing 3-0 away - that means you are out. 'It's about getting that level and balance right. We need to get back to where we were at against Hibs and in the first half against Hearts, where I thought we were superb.'","Rangers lost first game under new boss Stuart McCall on Thursday .

The Gers recently suffered their first defeat since Stuart McCall became head coach as they lost 3-0 at Queen of the South.

However, the inconsistency of the team could threaten their promotion bid.","Rangers' inconsistent form could derail their promotion bid, according to striker Kenny Miller. The side fell to a 3-0 defeat against Queen of the South on Thursday night, following victories against Hearts and Hibernian. The result leaves them one point behind Hibs on goal difference in the Scottish Championship with just five games left to play. While they could still avoid having to play two extra ties in the play-offs if they finish third, consistency will be key if they are to be promoted. Miller said the side needs to find a level of performance they can rely on every week rather than slipping into complacency.   "

Goal: Soriano . De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message.

Former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o gives a celebratory fist pump after his pass laid on the opening goal . Here Marco van Ginkel was dangerous from distance for Milan forcing Emiliano Viviano into action inside 15 minutes and was only just off target moments later. Destro, who left the field late in proceedings on a stretcher, headed a quality cross straight to Viviano on 30 minutes and did the same with a volley less than 10 minutes later. Alessio Cerci also squandered a chance from just outside the box over the crossbar. A different Sampdoria came out after the break and almost took the lead through Stefano Okaka and Eder, who was well saved by Diego Lopez at full stretch. AC Milan's supporters hold posters reading 'Vendesi' (meaning for sale) at the San Siro . Fans are growing increasingly disillusioned with those in charge of their club . A composed Eto'o orchestrated the deadlock breaker, taking the ample time he was gifted before threading his pass through the legs of fiery Mexes to a virtually lonesome Soriano just inside the box. The German-born Italian then casually slotted his shot to Lopez's right. But they couldn't hold onto the lead as De Jong's tried his luck to become the unlikely hero. And substitute Suso could have snatched the points late when his curling shot clattered into the post about fives minutes from the final whistle.","Samuel Eto'o laid on chance for Roberto Soriano opener for Sampdoria .

7316,"The 18-year-old student who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster has been expelled from his fraternity, withdrawn from college and submitted for mental assessment. DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity.

They added: 'As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot. However, last weekend the teenager from Madison, MS, swept the internet in a video that showed him pull a hamster from a cage, bite off its head, and hurl its body into the distance.

According to sources connected to the incident, the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana before the sickening stunt. His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, a born-again Christian who was slammed for blaming unemployment on the state's Hispanic population during his 2007 election campaign, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment last week before releasing a statement a day later. Now CEO of Eaves Law Firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Eaves Jr has unsuccessfully run for state governor and U.S. Congress. He lost to the Republican incumbent Haley Barbour, winning 42 per cent of the vote, following controversial claims about the state's growing Latino population. His clients today include victims of the Costa Concordia cruise boat crash. He has three sons from his first marriage, and a young daughter with Brady's mother, advertising executive Angel Eaves, in leafy Madison, MS. In the video, his stepson Brady is surrounded by friends in beachwear who shriek with laughter as he pulls the animal from a blue cage. The footage starts with the voice of one party-goer balking: 'Oh my f***ing God! No way!' Screaming: Eaves bellows a yell and smiles into the camera as party-goers look on open-mouthed . Others can be heard jeering: 'So good! So good!' Hurling the hamster over a fence, Eaves bellows a yell as others are seen grinning and laughing behind him. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Friday night under the name 'psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster'. Within minutes, it was removed from the video-sharing site for violating its codes of conduct. Caching the video, animal rights group PETA launched a manhunt to track Eaves down. Stephanie Bell, PETA's Cruelty Casework Director, told DailyMail.com they plan to press charges. 'It is horrific,' Bell said. 'Animal abuse is a community concern. People who abuse animals rarely do so only once and almost never stop there. 'The link between cruelty to animals and inter-personal violence is undeniable. Many of our nation's serial killers and most school shooters share a history of animal abuse. 'Often, humans and animals are abused at the same time. For example, the guy who kicks the family dog is likely abusing his spouse and children too. Cruelty to animals is always a red flag.' First, as the parents of Brady Eaves, let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character. While we are extremely disappointed and greatly disturbed by his actions, as his parents, we know Brady to be a very bright and talented young man with a huge heart. As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again. Raising teenagers in today’s world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation.

A Judge who fell asleep while a child abuse victim gave evidence and caused the trial to collapse has been reprimanded by his bosses . The part-time judge, Recorder Philip Cattan, 65, from Cheshire was seen to fall asleep during the rape trial of John Quingley at Manchester Crown Court last summer. A retrial had to be ordered and with the child having to give evidence for a second time, the Daily Mirror reported. While the jury was out of the room, the judge was confronted with the claim that he had slept through part of the cross-examination of the witness, who was giving evidence via videolink because of her age. The incident was witnessed by the family of the victim in the trial of John Quigley, which was expected to last five days . The girl giving evidence was the first of two young girls expected to testify that they were abused in offences spanning from 2006 to 2013. The body that regulates the judiciary, the Judicial Conduct Investigations office has rapped the Manchester recorder over the incident. The Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice were quoted as saying they found evidence of serious misconduct following complaints that Cattan gave the appearance of falling asleep. The cost of the abandoned trial and the retrial is believed to have cost the taxpayer £10,000. The defendant, Quingley, 49, of Benchill Manchester was found guilty of child sex charges and jailed for 14 years. Leading criminal barrister, Kama Melly, who specialises in child sex crime, told the Daily Mirror, when the trial was suspended, that it is always devastating for a victim to have a trial delayed so long while an investigation takes place. ‘This is no doubt a traumatic time for the family and this will only serve to make matters worse for them,’ she explained. The Lord Chief Justice Thomas of Cwmgiedd (left) and the Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling (right) were quoted as saying they found evidence of serious misconduct following complaints that Cattan fell asleep . Cattan’s role as recorder means he sits for up to thirty days a year as a judge and he has previously. He has overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots and major drugs cases. Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, fell asleep during the trial of Lee Woodward, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl on a riverbank in Sharpness, Gloucestershire. He was granted bail and a retrial was demanded where he was cleared. Judge Hutton, now retired, was ordered to apologise for the incident.

The incident caused a retrial and cost the taxpayer £10,000. Quingley was later found guilty of child sex charges and jailed for 14 years. Cattan's previous cases include overseen cases on gangland murders, the Oldham riots, and major drugs cases. Judge Gabriel Hutton, a former senior judge at Gloucester Crown Court, faced a similar incident and was ordered to apologise."
3742,"The CEO of the Italian eyewear company that makes Ray-Bans said that his company is working with Google on two new versions of its Google Glass project. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There’s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we’re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released.

5673,"She realised something was wrong when her grandmother struggled to use her knife and fork. Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan subsequently watched Alzheimer’s disease take hold of Margaret Booth. Now, 14 years after Mrs Booth, affectionately known as Nans by the actress, was diagnosed, Miss Mulligan has revealed her anger at how dismissively dementia sufferers are treated. Hollywood actress Carey Mulligan says more needs to be done to raise awareness of dementia. Her grandmother Margaret Booth, who she is pictured with here on a charity walk, suffers with the illness . The 29-year-old said she watched as her grandmother, a former teacher, develop problems with her memory. Mulligan, a patron of the Alzheimer's Society and said her gran hasn't recognised her in at least five years . According to the actress, 29, there is a ‘shame or humour’ attached to the illness, which causes memory loss and language problems. Despite being one of the greatest influences in Miss Mulligan’s career, having encouraged her to act and sing as a child, Mrs Booth is unaware of the extent of her granddaughter’s fame and appears to have struggled to recognise her for about eight years. Speaking about the disease, which affects 850,000 in the UK, Miss Mulligan said: ‘It’s quite quickly disregarded as being a sort of age-related thing, ‘Oh, granny’s lost her marbles’ – that sort of throwaway comment about somebody who has a brain disease… There’s not an awful lot of awareness in society.’ Mrs Booth was once a gifted piano player and a geography teacher, who took a great interest in her grandchildren’s education. But she began having trouble remembering things and would sometimes struggle to find her own home. And it means she has missed out on witnessing the success of Miss Mulligan’s career, which has seen her star in films including The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and her latest film Far From the Madding Crowd, which is out next month. The interview with Carey Mulligan appears in the latest edition of the Radio Times . Recalling watching the disease take hold, Miss Mulligan said: ‘One of the last times that we were at home together with her, we had a meal and she sat down and she looked at her knife and fork, and she didn’t know what they did.’ Ms Booth now lives in a residential home in Pontardawe, Wales. When one of Miss Mulligan’s films is on television, it is played by her carers, who wrote to Miss Mulligan to tell her ‘Nans is very proud’ of her when she won a BAFTA award for An Education. And every time Miss Mulligan begins a new play, such as Starlight which she starred in last year, her mother sends her a good luck opening night card, signed ‘from Nans’. Speaking about the touching tradition, Miss Mulligan told Radio Times: ‘She’ll put a photo of Nans in there, too. It’s really sweet. It makes me super emotional.’ Miss Mulligan, who is married to Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the band Mumford & Sons, first revealed her grandmother was suffering from Alzheimer’s in 2013, as she became a patron of the Alzheimer’s Society. Carey Mulligan meets a fan at the Far From The Madding Crowd premiere. Every time she begins a new play her mother sends her a good luck opening night card signed 'from Nans' with a photo of her grandmother . She said she wanted to make people ‘more aware in their daily lives of those who could be suffering with the disease’. And last year she wheeled her grandmother around a ‘memory walk’ in aid of the charity. Revealing her grandmother’s diagnosis, Miss Mulligan told Channel 4: ‘She hasn’t recognised me for about five or six years. That’s really hard. It’s really sad. But especially for my mum and my aunt and uncle. ‘She was a geography teacher and she was very passionate about our education and would always ask us about what GCSEs we were doing, what A-levels we were doing. ‘And I remember her one day not being able to remember the different subjects I was taking for A-level and I remember thinking that was something she cared so much about, that wouldn’t be something she easily forgot. 'And then it progressed from there, she would struggle to find her way home when she went out walking.’","Carey Mulligan's grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's disease .

3404,"A wife has told how she has put her husband on a lifelong sex ban and tracks his every move, after discovering he had cheated on her after taking a lie detector test. Despite his infidelity, Haley and Kev Mulholland still share a house in Bristol, though Mr Mulholland has to sleep on the living room sofa. The mother-of-eight says that while she does not want her husband, she does not want any other woman to have him either. Haley Mulholland became suspicious husband Kevin was having an affair after reading his Facebook page . Mrs Mulholland monitors her husband’s movements, checks his phone and even sniffs him to see if she can smell another woman’s perfume. 'I might not want Kev, but I don’t want anyone else to have him either,' said the 45 year old, who is mum to Sophie, 27, Kerrie, 25, Kasey, 14, Brittany, 13, Paige ten, Tyler, nine, Madison, eight and five-year-old Alexius. 'I keep tabs on his phone and on his Facebook page. He swears he’s staying true, but I couldn’t trust him as far as I could throw him. Over the past few months I’ve become quite the detective.' Though Mrs Mulholland has so far found no evidence to suggest he is straying, she refuses to take her husband of 15 years back. She said: 'While we’re not divorced, we’re not together. There’s no kissing, sex or anything like that, though Kev’s tried his luck. 'He creeps into my room saying the sofa’s given him a bad back and that he needs to sleep in my bed. I just tell him where to go. Kevin and Haley, who have been together for 15 years, are pictured on their wedding day . 'The other night he started stroking my thigh. I slapped his hand away. This body is well and truly out of bounds.' The Mulhollands' marriage became rocky shortly before they renewed their wedding vows on Valentine’s Day in 2013. Mrs Mulholland said: 'A month before the big day I was on the computer and noticed Facebook was still logged on to Kev’s profile. 'I clicked on his inbox, and discovered a message from one of our neighbours. 'She’d written ""Have you told her yet?"" which made my heart race. 'Had my Kev been going round for more than a cup of sugar? 'The rest of their correspondence was harmless enough, so I decided to give Kev the benefit of the doubt. Haley learns that Kevin did cheat her on after a lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle televsion show . 'But just weeks after our wedding I started hearing rumours about the two of them. 'I asked Kev if something was going on and he denied it. But I smelt a rat - a love rat.' That is when Mrs Mulholland started to doubt her husband and put him on a sex ban until he admitted the truth. She said: 'I trusted the people who were telling me. So I told him, no nookie until I get to the bottom it. 'Two years went by and I stuck to my word. We slept on opposite sides of the bed, absolutely no touching. Haley says she has banished Kevin to the sofa after learning that he cheated and has also imposed a sex ban . 'By the end Kev was so desperate for some hanky panky he suggested we went on the Jeremy Kyle show for a lie detector test. 'I booked for us to go on the show. A couple of nights later I checked Kev’s Facebook inbox and felt sick to my stomach. 'There were loads of messages from this other woman. She had written that she was worried she’d caught an STI from Kev. It was absolutely disgusting.' Mrs Mulholland went round to confront her neighbour who claimed her Facebook had been hacked. But the lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show revealed that Mr Mulholland had cheated on his wife with their neighbour. The couple trip the light fantastic after renewing their wedding vows just one month after Haley discovered the incriminating Facebook message suggesting Kevin was having an affair . The couple kiss after renewing their wedding vows before friends and family . She said: 'Kev walked off stage, swearing that the results were fixed. But that evening he finally admitted the truth. 'He said it had only lasted five minutes, but that didn’t matter to me. Once a cheat always a cheat. 'I knew we were over but I didn’t kick him out for the sake of the kids, instead I moved him downstairs. 'The little ones are none the wiser.' Mrs Mulholland said she has now started to track her husband’s movements to make sure he isn’t seeing other women. 'It sounds crazy as, hand on my heart, I do not want him back. But whenever he goes out I make a note of how long for and calculate what he could be doing,' she said. In happier times: Haley and Kevin who is father to six of her eight children . 'Maybe it’s jealousy or perhaps it’s because I want him to suffer. 'I know his Facebook password and I log in most days to check whether his floozy has been in touch. 'She’s kept quiet, and if she has any sense she’ll continue to do so.' It’s not just technology Mrs Mulholland uses to try and catch her husband out. 'The other day I hugged him as soon as he walked through the door. I think he saw it as progress, but I was just seeing if I could smell another woman on him. 'I make sure I know where he is at all times. 'So far he has passed the test, but if he ever fails I’m ready to pounce.' Mr Mulholland, who is unable to work due to a bad back, has told his wife he will win her back by remaining celibate until she changes her mind. He claims he’ll show he’s remained faithful by doing another lie detector test. Haley Mulholland says she now keeps tabs on her husband and checks his Facebook page . Mrs Mulholland said: 'I don’t know what I’d do if the results came back and he’s telling the truth. Maybe I’d take him back, maybe I wouldn’t. 'For now I’m happy being single. I don’t see a man in my future and I’ll be damned if there’s a woman in Kevin’s. 'He’s made his bed and he has to lie in it – alone.' Mr Mulholland, 46, said he was determined to win his wife back. 'I love Haley more than anything, no other woman compares. The kids and her are my life. 'I’m still living in the house, so there’s still love there.

7154,"All schools should display posters warning pupils and parents to respect teachers, union officials have said. The ‘hospital waiting-room-style’ signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families. Research from the NASUWT union shows that the majority of teachers today are verbally abused by pupils. Union officials from NASUWT say the ‘hospital waiting-room-style’ signs are needed as rising numbers of staff are subjected to swearing and physical attacks from pupils and their families . The behaviour of some youngsters – who hurl chairs, bring fireworks to school and threaten to slit other pupils’ throats – is so horrendous that staff have refused to teach them. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union’s survey last year. Meanwhile 38 per cent suffered similar problems with parents or carers compared with 24 per cent in 2014. Some 23 per cent had received threats of physical assault from a pupil, up ten percentage points, and 16 per cent had actually been attacked. This was a rise of seven percentage points on last year. Some 82 per cent of 3,500 NASUWT members polled were verbally abused by pupils in the last 12 months, up from 52 per cent in the union’s survey last year . NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates blamed factors including a narrow curriculum, rising class sizes and a lack of parental support for the growing tide of indiscipline. Speaking ahead of the union’s annual conference, which opened in Cardiff yesterday, she called on the government to produce poster templates for schools, using ‘strong messages’. ‘Increasingly, you go into railway stations and you see these posters which are basically saying we don’t tolerate our staff being abused,’ she said. Violent and disruptive pupils led the union to hold eight so-called refusal to teach ballots in schools last year. Here are some of the worst cases: . Birmingham . A Year One boy (age 6-7) was not excluded despite a history of physical assaults against staff and other pupils. Following notice of NASUWT action, the boy was removed from the school roll. Cardiff . A Year Ten pupil (age 14-15) verbally assaulted a woman teacher and threw a book which hit her face and drew blood. He was not expelled. Following notice of intention to ballot, the boy was assigned a learning support assistant at all times and was barred from the teacher’s lessons. Glasgow . An 11-year-old boy with a history of physical assaults, verbal abuse and threats of violence to teachers hurled chairs and other objects, but was excluded for only two days. The local authority moved him to another school after the NASUWT’s notice of intention to ballot. ‘You go into hospitals and you see similar posters, yet the government draws back from wanting to promote that kind of thing in schools.’ Miss Keates said that teachers are seen to be ‘exempt from that kind of protection and respect’. However, posters that tell ‘anyone using the premises – pupils, visitors, parents – that staff are not there to be abused’ give an ‘important message’. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the posters were a ‘good idea but shouldn’t be forced’ on schools. It comes after the NASUWT launched eight ‘refusal to teach’ ballots last year due to pupils being allowed back into the classroom despite their abysmal behaviour. In Gwynedd, north-west Wales, a 14-year-old girl was only temporarily suspended after threatening to slit another girl’s throat at a funfair and making a similar threat at school. She was expelled following the NASUWT’s ballot notice. Overall, 73 per cent of union members in this year’s survey believed there was a ‘widespread behaviour problem in schools’. The main causes of misbehaviour were lack of parental support (61 per cent) and pupils coming to school not ready to learn (44 per cent).","Schools should display posters warning pupils to respect teachers .

434,"Moscow (CNN)Never mind. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. ""We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,"" Peskov said. ""The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs."" The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing.  And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own. CNN's Madison Park and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow, and CNN's Ed Payne and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","Next month's visit to Moscow by the North Korean leader is off .

6355,"Poland said it is demanding a formal apology from the U.S. over the comments made by FBI director James Comey (pictured above) The US ambassador for Poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the FBI who blamed Polish people for helping the Nazis kill Jews during the Holocaust. James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said: 'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust. US ambassador to Poland Stephen Mull (pictured right) was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in Warsaw on Sunday (above he lays flowers at Monument to the Ghetto Heroes) In the April 16 opinion piece titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum, Comey wrote: 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil' (above the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in D.C.)","US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised for James Comey's comments .

Comey’s remarks in an editorial piece for the Washington Post were widely condemned in Polish media and by politicians in the country, including the President who referred to them as an “insult” to those who helped Jews during the Holocaust.

3758,"A family has been awarded $150 million by a jury after a four-year-old boy was killed when Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded into flames three years ago. Jurors in Decatur County, Georgia ruled on Thursday that the SUV manufacturer, Chrysler, acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of Remington 'Remi' Walden a 1999 Jeep with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle. Walden, of Bainbridge, Georgia, was killed when the Jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck in March 2012. Remington 'Remi' Walden, four, was killed three years ago when his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded when it was rear-ended . This March 6, 2012 photo shows the scene of a crash in Bainbridge, Georgia, where four-year-old Remi Walden was burned and died when a Jeep Grand Cherokee was struck from the rear by a Dodge Dakota pickup truck . The fuel tank leaked, engulfing the Jeep in flames and killing the four-year-old. The verdict came nearly two years after Chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model Jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks. The tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind, making them susceptible to punctures and fires. Federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash fires because of the rear-mounted fuel tanks. The jury of 11 women and one man, ruled after a nine-day trial that Chrysler was 99 per cent at fault for the crash and the pickup driver was 1 per cent at fault. Jurors also determined that Chrysler failed to warn the family of the hazards of driving the Jeep. They ruled that the Waldens should get $30 million for Remi's pain and suffering and $120 million for the full value of his life, according to a verdict form. Mike Palese, spokesman for Chrysler parent company FCA US, said the company is disappointed with the verdict and would appeal. Chrysler, he said, was prevented from presenting data submitted to federal safety regulators showing that the vehicles did not pose an unreasonable safety risk. 'The vehicles are not defective,' Palese said. Although the verdict is large, it isn't the largest judgment ever against an automaker in a personal injury case. In 1999, for example, a California jury ordered General Motors Co. to pay $4.9 billion to Patricia Anderson and Jo Tigner after their Chevrolet Malibu was rear-ended and burst into flames. In that case, four children in the back seat were severely injured. The family of a four-year-old boy who was killed when a Jeep Grand Cherokee (pictured) exploded in 2012 has been awarded  $150 million by a jury in Georgia . The amount was reduced on appeal to $1.2 billion. And in 2004, a woman paralyzed when her Ford Explorer rolled over won a $369 million verdict from Ford Motor Co. That was later reduced to $83 million, which Ford eventually paid after exhausting its appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond law school, said it will be difficult for Chrysler to overturn a jury verdict, but an appeals court might reduce the amount. He questioned Chrysler's decision to take the case to trial because of the horrific nature of the crash. Tobias said the Walden verdict is likely to lead others to sue the company or to speed along cases that are already in the system. Chrysler has long contended that the Jeeps were no more dangerous than comparable SUVs built at the time. It used that argument to convince the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2013 to allow it to recall 1.56 million Jeeps after the government agency initially recommended that 2.7 million be repaired. Under the recall, Chrysler agreed to install trailer hitches in the rear as an extra layer of protection. Safety advocates have called the size of the recall and the fix inadequate. On Thursday, Clarence Ditlow, the head of the Center for Auto Safety, called on the government to reopen its investigation against Chrysler. NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said late Thursday that the agency monitors legal decisions and 'if new information emerges, we take it into account and act appropriately.' Atlanta attorney Jim Butler argued during the trial that Remi's death resulted from the fire because of the gas tank's poor position. The child was on his way to a tennis lesson when the SUV was struck from behind. 'Numerous witnesses saw Remi struggling to escape and heard him screaming for help,' the family's lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit alleged that Chrysler placed the gas tank in a 'crush zone' behind the rear axle and knew the location was dangerous, and that the company failed to protect the gas tank against rupturing. Trial testimony showed that the compromise with safety regulators over the recall was worked out in a Chicago airport meeting between Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and ex-NHTSA Administrator David Strickland. Ditlow noted that Strickland now works for Venable, a law firm that has represented Chrysler.","Remington 'Remi' Walden, four, was killed three years ago when his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded when it was rear-ended .
