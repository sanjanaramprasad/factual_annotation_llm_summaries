1,"The Liberal Democrats have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 MPs, but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet",cnndm,"The Liberal Democrats are set to lose at least 20 MPs according to senior party sources, leaving them with a potential MP count in the thirties.

2,"If you had £140,000 to splurge, would you splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante or maybe even a three-bedroom detached house in Nottingham? Or, would you rather shell your hard-earned savings on a pink handbag? That is exactly what retailer Vestiaire Collective is hoping for, as they put a Hermes bag on sale for a cool £140,000 on their site. Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for £140,000 . So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies. The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment. Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time, unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.' With the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 Volante . Whilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bags . Hermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around £8,000 the Hermés Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported £1.5m). Prestigious luggage and accessories firm Hermés, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories. Renowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Hermès claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product. The brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them. The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac à dépêches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935. In 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac à dépêches to hide her pregnancy. Photographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since. Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth £1.5m .

The pink croc skin bag is embellished with rubies and it is made-to-measure. Hermes bags are seen as an investment as they are limited in supply and are often a collector's item.","Luxury retailer Vestiaire Collective is selling a hand-made, customised pink croc Hermes Birkin bag adorned with rubies for £140,000. Characterised by Brand Communications Director Fanny Moizant as “the epitome of quality”, experts suggest that high-end bags such as these represent an extremely sound investment which will only appreciate in value over time.

She added: 'It was made very clear to me that I was in no way allowed to touch her with my hands or approach her. 'She came to me from across the beach and made all of the decisions to cuddle up. I wanted to hug her so badly. 'Physically she felt like a big dough ball, super warm and like she had no bones. She did not smell of fish or have bad breath.

'They have never been in the ocean to learn to fish or anything and basically lay there starving until they figure out to take the leap of faith and go into the sea.

4,"(CNN)Two years ago, the storied Boston Marathon ended in terror and altered the lives of runners, spectators and those who tried to come to their rescue. Just last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges related to the bombings at the race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. The jury will begin deliberating his punishment next week. The death penalty is on the table. Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, were intent on terrorizing not just Bostonians, but all Americans, prosecutors said. But the Tsarnaevs were not on the minds of most people in Boston on Wednesday. The injured victims and those who lost their lives were spoken of with reverence in somber ceremonies. Relatives of 8-year-old Martin Richard, the attack's youngest victim, and the family of Krystle Campbell stood with Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin Walsh. Bagpipes played and banners whipped in the wind on Boylston Street, the Boston Globe reported. Boston University graduate student Lingzi Lu also was killed in one of the two horrific blasts that brought chaos to the competitors and spectators near the race's finish line on April 15, 2013. Who were the victims? Many bombing survivors were in the crowd for Wednesday's events, the newspaper said. They wore white, blue and yellow pins celebrating ""One Boston Day,"" which was created to recognize acts of valor and to encourage kindness among Bostonians. Many there and those who couldn't observe the day in person tweeted their respect and memories using #BostonDay. The marathon historically happens on a Monday. This year, runners will take on the 26.2 mile challenge April 20. ""I think today will always be a little emotional for me -- Marathon Monday is my favorite day of the year, and will continue to be, despite these tragedies,"" Boston resident Lindsey Berkowitz told CNN. ""I have so much respect and support for all of the survivors, and hope the city continues to come together on this day to embrace the strength and resilience of Boston, and the love we all have for this great city."" Melanie DiVasta was working just a mile from the finish line in 2013 when one of the bombs set by the Tsarnaevs exploded. Several of her friends were waiting at the finish line. They were unharmed. ""It was just an overwhelming feeling of shock to start hearing about it and seeing images,"" DiVasta said. ""You couldn't help but cry and just ask why."" What's next for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?

The 24-year-old, named locally as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, had shot himself in the leg before his arrest by anti-terrorist officers in the 13th arrondissement in southern Paris on Sunday. This afternoon the Paris prosecutor said police found Arabic documents mentioning ISIS and Al Qaeda at the IT student's home, as well as evidence on his computer that he was in contact with a man in Syria 'who clearly asked him to target a church.' Sunday's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in a car park in the Paris suburb of Villejuif.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve today said: 'A terrorist attack was foiled on Sunday morning.' 'The police discovered an arsenal containing weapons of war, and a suspect was immediately taken into custody.' Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Mr Cazeneuve said the suspect was found on a street in the 13th arrondissement of Paris with a bullet in his leg, and bleeding heavily. He originally claimed to be the victim of an attack by criminals, but officers followed the trail of blood to his car, where they found a Kalashnikov assaultrifle, and a Sig-Sauer automatic pistol. There were also stolen police armbands which would enable him to pose as a plain clothes officer. In Ghlam's student accommodation, detectives later found three automatic rifles, handguns, and bulletproof vests. There were also Jihadi flags and literature, false passports, and plans for attacks on 'one or two' churches in the Paris area. DNA analysis reportedly linked the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain, who was originally from Caudry, in northern France. The arrested man was an Algerian national studying computer science in Paris, and was known to the intelligence services. The man had been considered a likely candidate to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State terrorist organisation, said Mr Cazeneuve, and was officially under surveillance.

Nicholls said: ‘I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. ‘I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say ""sorry mate, he is not running"" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. ‘I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week.

12,"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised. They call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check. There is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light. People in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain. Scroll down for video . Residents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police. Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial . The officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial . 'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases. Nationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said. 'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.' Both Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence. Video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away . Original statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident . A dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light . Slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police. His new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.'

13,"Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' by the sexual assault but freed Josh Sweet after serving just two months on remand . A burglar who broke into a young teacher's home and sexually assaulted her as she lay in bed has been freed by a judge who handed him a community sentence. The decision's been slammed by a Victim Support charity worker, who said that 'victims deserve justice', after the 24-year-old teacher was left traumatised by the ordeal. Judge Mary Stacey admitted the victim had been 'scarred psychologically' during the case at Birmingham Crown Court, which has left her 'petrified' and afraid to go out. But Joshua Sweet, 20, from Birmingham, was freed and given a three-year community order on account of an early plea and having spent just two months in jail awaiting his court appearance. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said Sweet broke into the victim's home and took items including car keys and a mobile phone before making his way upstairs, where the victim was asleep. In the dead of night, she awoke to find the intruder 'standing beside her bed' and screamed, which is when the terrifying assault began. Sweet then rolled down her duvet and touched the defendant sexually, saying 'you're not going to make any noise are you?' Miss Rai said the woman was extremely frightened and tried to divert the defendant. Sweet touched the woman’s bottom and upper thigh but as he took hold of the waistband of her pyjama bottoms, her house-mate, the owner of the property, came into the room and he fled. The police were called and Sweet was arrested nearby, but the victim's ordeal continued. In a statement she said she had been 'petrified' at finding a stranger in her bedroom and that the incident, which had caused her to take time off work, had left her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. She said she had put a bolt on her bedroom door and had been reluctant to come out. Sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults range up to eight years for the most serious cases. And although the nature of this case falls in the lower end of the scale, the sentence angered a victim support charity that said offenders 'must be given a punishment that fits their crime'. Joshua Sweet, 20, admitted burglary and sexual assault and was given a three-year community order, ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work and must register as a sex offender for five years . Carolyn Hodrien, victim services director for Victim Support, said: 'From supporting thousands of victims of sexual assault, we know what a devastating impact it can have on people's lives. 'Victims deserve justice and for this to happen offenders must be given a punishment that fits their crime. Community orders can be a really effective way to manage some offenders, but should never be issued for a serious offence or as a quick-fix.'

15,"(CNN)The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The institute is working with state health leaders to control the ""severe outbreak,"" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people ""who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,"" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there ""is not a lot to do."" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as ""a community activity,"" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection.

Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella.

Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.'

He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team.

20,"Green party leader Natalie Bennett has been forced to distance herself from a bizarre online site run by her boyfriend. Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember… Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea?

Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day.

I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit.

26,"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.",cnndm,"Two deputies involved in the shooting of Eric Harris have been reassigned due to threats against them and their families.

27,"(CNN)Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.

30,"The town of Reading may have been swept up in FA Cup euphoria, but Steve Clarke has instructed his players to approach this weekend's semi-final like any other day at work. It has been 88 years since the Royals last reached the last-four juncture and the SkyBet Championship side travel to Wembley facing the unenviable task of overcoming in-form Arsenal. Reading are striving to make the FA Cup final for the first time in their history, leading to excitement understandably building in Berkshire - if not the club's Hogwood Park training ground. Reading overcame League One side Bradford with a 3-0 replay win to progress to FA Cup semi-final . Clarke, a winner as player and coach at Chelsea, has told his players not to get caught up in the occasion, with progression the only objective. 'I think when you go through to semi-finals, the only way to enjoy it is to win the game,' the Reading manager said. 'You can't go to Wembley and play the occasion. It is not about playing the occasion, we're playing Arsenal. 'For us, it has to be a day of work. We have to go there focused only on what happens on the pitch. The Royals face Premier League giants Arsenal in crunch clash on Saturday at Wembley . 'The supporters can go and enjoy the day, that's their little reward for a cup run. 'For us, it is to go there with a mentality that we are there to do a job and if we do that right we can go through.' Clarke is confident his players can make history on Saturday, even though few outsiders share his faith. One bookmaker has them at 14/1 to win and Reading's manager accepts they will have to play the 'perfect game' to overcome an Arsenal side on the back of eight straight league wins. It has been 88 years since Reading last made an appearance in the semi-finals of the FA Cup . 'They look strong, well-balanced,' Clarke said. 'They're winning games. 'They have terrific players. Great problems for us to solve. 'Maybe they have left their run too late to catch Chelsea at the top but certainly a good chance to finish the season strongly.' Reading have no fresh injury concerns ahead of the semi-final, with Pavel Pogrebnyak fit after a slight calf complaint ruled him out of Tuesday's 1-0 loss to table-topping Bournemouth. Steve Clarke was appointed Reading manager in December 2014 to replace Nigel Adkins . Clarke felt defeat was harsh on his side, stretching a run of winless matches to five since winning the quarter-final replay against Bradford. 'Cup competitions, one-off games, we seem to have approached it with a little bit more freedom, a little less nervousness, if you like,' the Royals boss said.

Wilshere was a Hitchin boy, spotted early by Luton’s scouts before Arsenal took him to their Hale End academy at nine. At 16, he made his first-team debut for Arsene Wenger’s side.

Like Jack, he is a midfielder. The Patinos are a level-headed family, absorbing the enormity of the offers on the table from three of the biggest clubs in the Premier League before they come to a decision at the end of the season. ‘We just want what’s best for Charlie, to give him the best chance of being a professional footballer if that is what he wants to do,’ said dad Julio on Wednesday. ‘He is a dedicated boy, he works hard at school, gets good grades and is committed to playing football. He just loves it.’ Charlie took to the game at an early age, developing a feel for the ball that was far more advanced than his peers. ‘Other parents have commented on it in the past,’ admitted Julio. The big clubs have played everything by the book, formalising their interest with official communication to Luton and offering to meet FIFA’s compensation guidelines. The transfer fee involved is £10,000, a sizeable amount to spend on a player who offers potential and promise after six years with Luton. There are no guarantees that Charlie, who is a season ticket holder at Luton with his dad, will go on to make the grade when he eventually makes a decision.

38,"(CNN)The American Pharmacists Association is discouraging its members from participating in executions. On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. ""Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way."" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.",cnndm,"The American Pharmacists Association has adopted a policy that discourages its members from participating in executions because ""such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.""

Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.",cnndm,"An explosion at a chemical plant in China's Fujian province has injured six people after a fire broke out at an oil storage facility.

40,"(CNN)It's one of the most famous faces in history, even though no one really knows what he looked like. Instead, every culture, every generation, remakes Jesus in its own image. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed savior when America was mostly Anglo-Protestant, at least in Hollywood's eyes. An androgynous, meek-and-mild messiah during the anything-goes 1970s. A studly action-figure hero after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Flip through the gallery above, and you'll see what I mean. If you turned on the television this past Sunday, though, a new vision of Jesus came into view. Darker, in mood and skin tone. Earthy rather than ethereal. If not following all of history's clues -- Hollywood has yet to cast an actual Jew as Jesus -- then at least inching closer. Flipping through the channels on a day millions of Western Christians celebrated the resurrection of their savior, viewers could choose from ""Killing Jesus,"" a NatGeo production rebroadcast Sunday on Fox. ""A.D.,"" NBC's sequel to the blockbuster miniseries ""The Bible,"" and ""Finding Jesus,"" CNN's addition to the ever-burgeoning body of Christ-centered TV fare. Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? What unites these disparate projects, besides a recognition that Jesus always draws an audience and the Good Book is good for business, is the type of men chosen to play Christ. They are brawny, with brown eyes and dark complexions. They look like men who could be carpenters, if not in Nazareth, than at least in the Mediterranean neighborhood. Haaz Sleiman, from ""Killing Jesus,"" was born and raised in Lebanon. He's also Muslim, a fact that annoyed some Christians, who took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage, including Native American, portrays Jesus during the historical reenactments in ""Finding Jesus."" And Juan Pablo Di Pace -- a Argentinian named after the late St. Pope John Paul II -- takes a starring role in ""A.D.,"" replacing Diogo Morgado, dubbed ""hot Jesus,"" by some, ""smarmy Jesus"" by others. You could make the case that authenticity is the coin of our current entertainment realm, and that filmmakers are competing to make their work as historically accurate as possible. Contemporary viewers are too savvy to stomach the fake beards and odd accents that littered the camels-and-sandals epics of eras past. But there's another, deeper meaning behind our new, multicultural Jesuses, scholars say. ""Filmmakers and networks are in touch with the fact that the complexion of America has changed,"" said Stephenson Humphries-Brooks, a religion scholar and author of ""Cinematic Savior: Hollywood's Making of the American Christ."" ""A large number of Americans are people of color: Latinos and Middle Easterners and people from India,"" Humphries-Books continued. ""That means the audience base is shifting in various and important ways."" The audience base may be shifting, but it's also tuning in. Each of the Jesus shows drew big ratings, which means you'll likely be seeing more of Christ as you channel surf. But according to the Apostle Paul, almost every depiction of Jesus so far has gotten at least one detail wrong: his flowing locks. Real men don't",cnndm,"New TV shows are beginning to present Jesus in a darker, more authentic way, with actors chosen by filmmakers who are conscious that more Americans are people of color. Killing Jesus starred Muslim, Haaz Sleiman, alongside Finding Jesus actor, Adam Bond, a British actor of mixed heritage. Each of the shows drew big ratings, supporting the notion that the complexion of the TV audience in America is changing, and that we should look forward to more multicultural Jesuses in the future. 
","A new trend in television depictions of Jesus has emerged where the actors chosen to play Christ are dark skinned with brown eyes, representing the diverse American population. Film makers and networks have recognised that the complexion of America has changed, with a large number of people of colour, and that this shift in audience base is important. Each of the Jesus shows including ""Killing Jesus,"" ""A.D."" and ""Finding Jesus"" each gained high ratings.

42,"It's every interviewer's worst nightmare. Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning. Naomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives. Justin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake. And Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life. Here are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview: .

Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.

43,"Miami (CNN)World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has an important title defense coming up, but his thoughts continue to be dominated by the ongoing fight for democracy in Ukraine. Speaking to CNN from his Miami training base ahead of the April 25 showdown with American challenger Bryant Jennings in New York, Klitschko said the crisis in his homeland has left him shocked and upset. ""My country is unfortunately suffering in the war with Russia -- not that Ukraine tried to give any aggression to any other nation, in this particular case Russia, unfortunately it's the other way around,"" Klitschko told CNN. ""I never thought that our brother folk is going to have war with us, so that Ukrainians and Russians are going to be divided with blood,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we don't know how far it's going to go and how worse it's going to get. The aggression, in the military presence of (Russian) soldiers and military equipment in my country, Ukraine, is upsetting."" Klitschko is the reigning IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion and has, alongside older brother Vitali, dominated the heavyweight division in the 21st century. Vitali, who retired from boxing in 2013, is a prominent figure in Ukrainian politics. The 43-year-old has led the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform since 2010 and was elected mayor of Kiev in May last year. Tensions in the former Soviet state remain high despite a ceasefire agreed in February as Europe, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France Francois Hollande, tries to broker a peace deal between the two sides. The crisis in Ukraine began in November 2013 when former President Victor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union in favor of forging closer economic ties with Russia. The move triggered a wave of anti-government protests which came to a head Kiev's Maidan Square in February 2014 when clashes between protesters and government security forces left around 100 dead. The following month, Russian troops entered Ukraine's Crimean peninsula before Russian President Vladimir Putin completed the annexation of Crimea -- a move denounced by most of the world as illegitimate -- after citizens of the region had voted in favor of leaving Ukraine in a referendum. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the conflict to date. ""People are dying in Ukraine every single day,"" Klitschko said. ""I do not want to see it, nobody wants to see it ... it's hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen."" But with the backing of the international community, Klitschko is confident Ukraine can forge a democratic future rather than slide back towards a Soviet-era style dictatorship. ""I really wish and want this conflict to be solved and it can only be solved with Western help,"" he said. ""Ukraine is looking forward to becoming a democratic country and live under Western democracy. This is our decision and this is our will to get what we want.

He added that people die in his country every day in a struggle that is ""hard to believe these days something like that in Europe -- and Ukraine is Europe -- can happen""; he then spoke positively of Ukraine's desire to become a democratic country and to live under Western democracy, recognising that this can only be realised with Western support.","World heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has spoken out about his desire for a democratic future for Ukraine, stating that the conflict can only be solved with Western help.

One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body. Scroll down for video . Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPR . Scott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser — as trained by the department — and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.' On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation. There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body. Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away. Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down. The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and",cnndm,"Questions have arisen as to whether other North Charleston police officers helped to cover up former officer Michael Slager's killing of Walter Scott by corroborating a report that Scott had charged Slager, leaving him no choice but to shoot. These discrepancies have arisen since the video of the killing emerged to the public, showing that Scott was running away from Slager when he was shot in the back. Today the North Charleston Police Chief and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) released incident reports relating to the killing of Walter Scott by officer Michael T. Slager, including a witness statement supporting the original police report stating that the attacker had charged Slager, however, the incident report does not reflect the apparent lack of respect shown to Scott's body&nbsp;after he had been gunned down, with the Police Chief stating ""Some of the actions taken by the officers on the scene are not consistent with the policies and practices of North Charleston Police Department"".&nbsp;","Questions are being raised over the conduct of Michael Slager's fellow police officers, who responded to his call for back-up after shooting Walter Scott. Scott was shot 5 times in the back and his wounds were not disclosed in the police's incident report. Officers also claimed that they gave Scott CPR, but bystander video only shows them checking his pulse and standing over his body."

53,"A young Syrian boy has revealed how he saw depraved Islamic State militants playing football with a severed head inside the besieged Yarmouk refugee camp. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he stumbled on the barbaric scene shortly after the terrorists beat him unconscious when they burst into his family home at the camp in the Syrian capital Damascus. The schoolboy said the ISIS fighters were looking for his brother, who is a member of the Palestinian rebel group who ran and defended the camp for several years before ISIS carried out a bloody assault that has left more than 200 people dead in just seven days. His story was revealed as refugees in Yarmouk spoke of the daily atrocities they have witnessed since ISIS seized control of 90 per cent of the camp, including innocent children being slaughtered in front of their anguished parents. Scroll down for video . Scene of death: A destroyed graveyard is photographed in Yarmouk camp following the intense fighting .

After enduring two years of famine and fighting, Ibrahim Abdel Fatah said he saw heads cut off by ISIS in the Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. That was it. He fled and hasn't looked back. Unshaven, pale and gaunt, he has found refuge with his wife and seven children at the Zeinab al-Haliyeh school in Tadamun, a southeastern district of the Syrian capital held by the army. 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised,' he said. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved,' the 55-year-old said. The school is currently home to 98 displaced people, among them 40 children, who have been put up in three classrooms. The usual occupants, schoolchildren, have been evacuated temporarily from rooms where mattresses and bedding now blanket the floor. 'I left my house which was the only thing I had.

54,"Fresh fears were raised last night that Greece could exit the eurozone after it was claimed negotiations with its European creditors were ‘not working’. An official at the International Monetary Fund reportedly admitted that he cannot envisage a successful conclusion to the country’s bailout. Greece this week repeated threats to stop paying off its loan and default on its debt if Europe refuses to release more funds. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors . This would make it harder for the country to remain in the eurozone, although no state has ever left and there is no official exit process. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's Europe Director has been quoted by the Greek media as saying he could not see a successful conclusion to the country's current bail out. The fund's Europe chief reportedly told his executive board that negotiations were not going as hoped, the Daily Telegraph reported. Thomsen's prediction was made as the Greek government repeated previous threats that unless more bail out money was made available then it would stop paying back creditors. One Greek official has been quoted by the Financial Times as saying that if the European Central Bank did not play ball with the Mediterranean Eurozone member there could be no alternative to a default. Mr. Thomsen also issued a warning over Greece's recent, weak economic performance. He met with Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier this month. Greece repaid a roughly €450 million loan instalment to the International Monetary last week but Athens' financial problems, as outlined by Mr. Thomsen, have renewed fears the country might miss the IMF payment of €200m payment on the 1st May and another for €745m 11 days later. This could lead to he EU member being forced, eventually, to leave the eurozone. The IMF debt stems from Greece's international bailout, under which the country was extended €240 billion in rescue loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF to prevent bankruptcy. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) met with Mr. Thomsen who expressed worry over the Greek economy.

55,"Aubrey de Grey (pictured) says ageing is a 'disease that can and should be cured' With his Rasputin beard and lines etched deep into his forehead, Aubrey de Grey looks like a man a lot older than his 51 years. A penchant for beer, fried food and an aversion to exercise could fool you into believing the lanky ex-public schoolboy cares little about ageing. But you would be wrong. For de Grey, a charismatic Harrow School and Cambridge-educated biomedical theorist, firmly believes there is no reason, with the right 'therapies', why any of us shouldn't reach 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 years of age. It sounds bonkers but de Grey's theories have gained him some high-profile supporters in Silicon Valley, the super-rich tech enclave in northern California that is home to more middle-aged billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. PayPal boss Peter Thiel (worth £1.5 billion) donated £2.4 million to de Grey's anti-ageing institute Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS). Senescence is scientific jargon for ageing. While many academics mock him, in age-obsessed California de Grey now regularly breaks bread and funds his research with donations from some of the sharpest minds in the world, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin (who has talked of 'curing death') and Larry Ellison, of Oracle, who are all showing an interest in gerontology, or the study of ageing. Google's Bill Maris, who heads the computer giant's investment arm, said: 'We have tools in the life sciences to achieve anything you have the audacity to envision. I hope to live long enough not to die.' One source at a leading software company told The Mail on Sunday: 'De Grey has tapped a rich vein in Silicon Valley. He's become something of a controversial cheerleader for a generation of tech billionaires who have made their fortunes and now, of course, want to live for ever.' De Grey was raised in Chelsea by his artist mother Cordelia, who left him £11 million when she died in 2011 – £9 million of which he has invested in his company. He spent the remainder on a 'very nice house'. He never knew his father and became fascinated by seeking a cure for ageing while still at Harrow. Scroll down for video . 'Ageing is a disease that can and should be cured,' he says. 'I've been ridiculed but finally people are starting to come round to my way of thinking. Anyone who has ever wanted to change the world has been attacked. Gandhi said first they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you and then they say, ""We were with you all along"".' De Grey's radical thesis is that ageing can be halted and even reversed by treating the human body like a vintage car – 'replace the parts, clean it up, keep it running smoothly way past its expected expiration date'. His argument is that cellular decay causes ageing, illness and, ultimately, death, and that technologies being developed now and inventions in the future will allow us to repair and replace damaged body",cnndm,"Aubrey de Grey, a biomedical theorist, believes that with the right therapies, people could reach 500, 1,000, or even 5,000 years of age.

58,"English cricket’s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

60,"We all know the time-consuming hassle of having to hoover the house, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this Russian aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks. What is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem, which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor, and using the contraption as a huge leaf-blower. The crew of the Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's largest warship, came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing. Russian sailors on board the Admiral Kuznetsov, the country's largest aircraft carrier, have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks, by strapping an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor . Debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines, so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck, but the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother . Even a single stray nut or bolt, if sucked into one of the fighter plane's engines, could spell disaster for the pilot, and cause millions of dollars worth of damage. Usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects, using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up. But with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day, the crew of the Kuznetsov decided to do away with that bother, and took a more direct approach. According to blog Foxtrot Alpha, the sailors have attached an old MiG-15 engine to the front of a tractor, before fitting the front end with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the ship's deck. The vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft-long deck, blowing all debris overboard. The massive Kuznetsov is the jewel in President Putin's military fleet, carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters. The ingenious crew members fitted the old MiG engine with a diffuser, spreading the air out over the deck, and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower, sending debris overboard . The Kuznetsov has a deck spanning 14,700sqft, so rather than search the entire thing by hand, Russian sailors built themselves a giant leaf-blowing machine instead . Bristling with anti-aircraft cannons, rocket batteries, gatling guns and underwater missiles, it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew. However, that is nothing compared to the US Nimitz Class aircraft carriers, the tenth and last of which, the George HW Bush, was commissioned in 2009. The ship weighs 102,000 tons, is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters. The UK's largest carrier in the HMS Queen Elizabeth, weighing in at 65,00 tonnes, it carries 40 jets and helicopters, along with 1,600 crew.

61,"A breakthrough has been made in the development of clean hydrogen power, scientists claim. At the moment, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Hydrogen-fuel is appealing for use in cars like the Vauxhall Zafira minivan pictured, but producing hydrogen requires huge amounts of energy. With the new breakthrough, it could be possible to make it more easily . Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University created the invention. It uses a newly designed molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. Lead research Dr Ulrich Hintermair told MailOnline that the main problem with the production of hydrogen through a process known as water electrolysis was the waste oxygen it produces. Water splitting is an electro-chemical process in which two electrodes generate oxygen and hydrogen from water, respectively. The energy required to drive this process gets locked up in the hydrogen as the fuel with oxygen as a by-product. A fuel cell can then harness the energy again elsewhere by recombining the two. The new patented catalyst is more efficient at performing the crucial oxidation half of the reaction than any other existing material, minimising energy losses in the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion process. It can be directly applied to various electrode surfaces in a straightforward and highly economical manner. The process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen but, while the first part can be done quite efficiently, the latter was more difficult and lots of energy is lost. With this in mind the team designed a catalyst - a substance that alters the speed of the chemical reaction - to improve the efficiency. ‘Oxygen is the most difficult bit,’ Dr Hintermair explained. Their catalyst, placed on an electrode used in the production of hydrogen, is much more efficient - and although Dr Hintermair didn’t have an exact figure, he said the energy loss using it is ‘almost non-existent’. The major benefit from this breakthrough is that hydrogen could now be used more easily as a way to store energy from renewable sources like wind and solar. ‘We can make electricity out of sunlight and wind, low carbon renewable sources, but we can’t store it very well,’ Dr Hintermair continued. ‘We can put it in a battery but you can’t, for example, fly an airplane on a battery yet. ‘So we need to convert it into a chemical fuel, and for that water electrolysis is a key technology because we can take any renewable technology, connect it to an electrolyster and store it in hydrogen, which is a fantastic fuel.’ This, for example, would make hydrogen fuel cells for cars much more economical. On this right in this image is the catalyst being used in the water electrolysis process. The large bubbles are oxygen, while the smaller bubbles on the left are hydrogen . The team are in discussions with",cnndm,"Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have developed a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, making clean hydrogen power more viable.

Figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Labour received £1.9million in the week to April 5, with 84 per cent coming from just three trade unions. It included a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey. Ed Miliband received £1.6m from union barons in the first week of the election campaign, figures have revealed . Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds. Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly £7 in every £10 donated to Labour has come from the unions – amounting to more than £40million. In the first round of election donations registered, £506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave £51,072. Labour received a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey (pictured) The party did attract one large business donation, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard.

Ukip received only £35,416 in the period but last night its coffers were boosted by a £1million donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond, who gave £300,000 last year. In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received £501,850 and the Lib Dems £20,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories – £75,000 – came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers’ UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West’s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave £20,000. Syrian-born Mr Asfari, who has given the Tories about £400,000, was made a ‘business ambassador’ by David Cameron last year. Home insurance boss Richard Harpin of Homeserve gave £50,000. His company was fined £30million last year for a mis-selling scandal. Hedge fund manager, James Diner, who once dated model Caprice, gave £25,000 while socialite Fitriani Hay, who co-owns property development firm JMP Group with her racehorse-owning husband James, donated £66,850. Ukip received £25,000 from Robin Birley, who is also bankrolling Tory chief whip Michael Gove’s re-election campaign.

64,"Imran Uddin used a keyboard spying device to hack into university computers and up his exam marks . A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard ‘shadowing’ devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as £49 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: ‘For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.’ He warned that Uddin’s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a ‘deterrence’ to others. Judge Burbridge said: ‘This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.’ Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year. When they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered. Staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said: ‘It is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science.’ Miss Rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a ‘staff only’ area to obtain the password of employee Christine Chapman, who had access to exam grade software.

This weekend saw its TV channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene. This no doubt will have the purists, and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved, spitting at the very mention. But with Wembley on board for both games, I doubt the BBC and BT Sport will have minded presenting their coverage from HQ. However, on Saturday evening, Ian Wright was dead sheepish about it in the BBC’s on-site studio. ‘I don’t like semi finals at Wembley’, said Wrighty squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it.

This time about the fact the match clashed with the big Premier league game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Yes, over on Sky Sports, you could have witnessed business as usual at Stamford Bridge. With a first half that Jamie Redknapp at one point described as ‘difficult to watch’. If you weren’t watching Chelsea's victory, what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event, a real footballing occasion. Alongside Wright, the extremely engaging Jason Roberts hoped his old club Reading wouldn’t treat their premature trip to north west London as ‘a day out' and believed there was a chance the Royals could win against Arsenal. Well, they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football. A clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement. Reading, pictured celebrating after Garath McCleary's goal, contributed to a great encounter on Saturday . What’s more, there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage. Firstly, when a film about the infamous 1990 FA Cup Semi Finals failed, Gary Lineker was left with a spare few minutes to fill. Which he did with a great chat about his guests' Cup Final Wembley memories. ‘It’s a wonderful experience, winning an FA Cup, isn’t it Wrighty?’, observed Lineker before turning to the distinctly pot free Alan Shearer. ‘Don’t start again, Gary!’, barked Al, his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros.

68,"Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' Breast cancer patients may be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests that pinpoint genetic 'markers' in the tumour and determine its aggressiveness. After surgery, the cancer cells are sent to a lab where they are screened, and women can be told within days whether they have a high or low risk of the disease returning. For some women, the test can accurately tell if the risk is as low as five per cent, which is as good as if not better than the odds for those who have chemotherapy. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence. Although the medication kills off cancer cells, the side effects – including complete hair loss, nausea, sickness, weight gain or loss, and extreme fatigue – can be difficult to live with. For some women, the prospect of chemotherapy is more daunting than the surgery itself. But experts have long-believed that the risk of cancer recurrence for certain women is a lot less than for others, and that for some, chemotherapy may not be necessary. If the newest of the tests, called EndoPredict, shows a low score, patients can opt not to have chemotherapy. Most of the tests are available only privately and cost about £2,500, although breast specialists hope they may soon become properly available on the NHS. Surgeon Hemant Singhal said: 'I think there is a good case for the NHS to use this test on the basis that the cost is balanced out by savings in not giving chemotherapy.' Professor Kefah Mokbel, consultant breast surgeon at St George's Hospital, London, said: 'With this test we can help patients make an informed choice, whereas in the past we have just given chemotherapy to almost everyone.' Becca Cornford, a 49-year-old mother of three aged 11, six and four, was recovering from being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer last year only to then discover that she had cancer in her other breast. The majority of women who have breast cancer are routinely given the gruelling drug treatment following removal of the tumour to prevent recurrence . She said: 'I dreaded chemo more than another mastectomy. I was worried it would interfere with me being able to look after my children.' Professor Mokbel operated on Becca in December at the Princess Grace Hospital, London, and afterwards a sample of her tumour was sent away and tested using the EndoPredict. A low score meant her chances of recurrence within ten years were just five per cent and she was told chemotherapy could not offer much better odds. 'I could have gone through chemo and the cancer could still return,' she says. 'There is no treatment that places your chances at zero. But if you have regular monitoring, there is every chance that any cancer that might come back would be nipped in the bud early.'",cnndm,"Breast cancer patients could be spared chemotherapy thanks to new tests which determine the tumour’s aggressiveness by pinpointing genetic “markers”.

The tests, such as EndoPredict, take a sample of the tumour and trace the genetic markers, giving women a percentage-risk that their cancer may come back. A low score can offer patients the option of not having chemotherapy, a result welcomed by may women who face the side effects of such treatment.

70,"A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house has been spared jail. He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: ""Stop this Tim, don't do it"".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey.

Nick Tucker, defending, said: 'It's clear from her statement that [the victim] loves her son and she's concerned for him, despite what she's suffered. 'One of the reasons this is not only sad, but a difficult case, is that we can't confidently say why this happened. 'The defendant is unable to explain what triggered this or the previous assaults.' Norris-Jones was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, at Guildford Crown Court (above) and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew . Norris-Jones, from Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, admitted two counts of ABH and was cleared of one count of GBH when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court.

Christian Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham . Benteke points to the skies in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke said: ‘The more the better, I think it's risky to say we can take three points and we're finished. We have to try to win every game. ‘Saturday was a massive three points because now we're six points clear of QPR so it's very important for us to be far off them.’ Benteke, 24, said the match against Brendan Rodgers’ team at Wembley was the biggest of his career. ‘For the moment, yes,’ he said. ‘It (missing the World Cup) was hard but now it's in the past, I'm looking forward to playing the semi final. Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . ‘Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it's still something special. It's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites. ‘Wembley is something good and special because it's a semi final, it's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again.’ Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences.

74,"Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bombs tore through their bodies: singeing flesh, shattering bones, shredding muscles and severing limbs. But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called ""Princess."" ""Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,"" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. ""Nobody fills that boot now."" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, ""a jolly soul,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: ""Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love."" ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,"" Pellegrini told the jury. ""And that is the very essence of terror."" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath . To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. ""These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,"" Pellegrini said. ""Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters."" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. ""She traded that in for a bat,"" Campbell said. ""She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her."" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held.

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player.

Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope.

76,"Researchers have completed the first comprehensive study of the microbes living on and in and uncontacted tribe from the Amazon. They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - and that the bacteria they found could be potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international.

This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year.

79,"Children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky, plastic Fisher-Price magnets that adorned fridges in family homes. The popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell. But for some people, they had another unintended consequence; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters. The child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete. His colour-letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the Fisher-Price magnet set, which is in the foreground . At least that's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. It is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia, and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time. A large amount of research, according to Discover magazine, has previously suggested the condition can be learned, rather than being the result of genetic factors. This graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy. The rows correspond to participants and columns to letters. The colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter . The latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link A with red, F with purple and P with green. Researchers from the Department of Psychology at Stanford University used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters. They then compared these colour-letter matches to fridge magnets sold by Fisher-Price between 1971 and 1990. The results revealed that at least six per cent (400 out of the 6588 participants) learnt 'many of their matches' from the Fisher-Price set. Among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured, the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter-colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent. The colours in the toy (upper row), the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes (middle row), and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here. Fig C shows when the choice does not match the toy (bottom row) Red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set. Grey bars show participants with seven or more matches. For participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 per cent . Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together. For instance, some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words. Others experience tastes, smells or shapes. Some people are born with synaesthesia, while others experience it after a stroke, or while using psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Famous synaesthetes include singers Pharrell",cnndm,"A study has found that Fisher-Price magnets from the 1970s and 1980s may have changed the colours that people associate with letters.

Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good.

'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens.

81,"A Texas mom who has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her four-year-old adopted son, and was released shortly before Christmas, will not face new murder charges. Hannah Overton, 37, wiped back tears as she, along with her husband Larry and five children, celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt, prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case. Throughout her incarceration, her family stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges. He could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Hannah Overton (above wiping away tears with her daughter and son) will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to celebrate the news . In a news release however, Skura said that he would not be trying the case again due to 'a myriad of factors which came about after a careful review of the previous trial, re-interviewing some of the key witnesses, consulting with some of the medical experts involved in the case, reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearings and staffing the case with the current prosecutors assigned to the case.' A judge then granted Skura's motion to dismiss. 'Wow, we don't even know where to begin,' Overton said after hearing this news. 'We are so excited about all God has done in and through all of this. He has carried us through.' An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt.

Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, burst into the Londis shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool in October last year while the owner, his wife, and their toddler were behind the counter.

After the sentencing police said the attack was 'extremely distressing' for the family, who had been 'left in fear of their lives' during the raid.

With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.'

84,"If Wigan Athletic are to be relegated from the Sky Bet Championship, then their new manager Gary Caldwell would want to see them go down kicking and screaming. Martyn Waghorn took that a little too literally against Millwall, his red card for a senseless kick at Dan Harding punished by a Lions side determined to avoid a similar fate. When Waghorn, who played for Millwall on loan from Leicester in 2013, lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour, it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points. And they were duly delivered when Jimmy Abdou headed home Harding’s cross with 15 minutes remaining, sending a febrile Den into raptures. Millwall team-mates rush to congratulate substitute Magaye Gueye after he scored their second goal . Lions No 1 David Forde celebrates after Jimmy Abdou came on to break the deadlock with a rare strike .

Booked: Bong, Bo-Kyung . Sent off: Waghorn, Pearson . Referee: Stephen Martin (Staffordshire) In his six seasons at the club, that was only Abdou’s seventh goal. What a time for it. The official Millwall Twitter account reassured followers it wasn’t a misprint. There was more drama to follow. Jason Pearce followed Waghorn down the tunnel for a dreadful tackle on Aiden O’Brien as tempers flared in the closing stages, with Millwall’s Ed Upson also dismissed for his reaction. The game had threatened to erupt all night. There were two confrontations in the first-half, with Caldwell and his Millwall counterpart Neil Harris on the edge of their technical areas appealing for calm. And a second goal from Magaye Gueye in the third minute of stoppage time made absolutely sure, the substitute leading a breakaway on his own before finishing calmly past Carson. Millwall’s win keeps the Championship relegation battle very much alive and throws the pressure onto Rotherham United, who face Fulham on Wednesday night. The plot could also thicken further if Rotherham are docked three points for fielding an ineligible player in their win over Brighton earlier this month. Hope is still very much alive in south London after this, the gap closed to just four points. Harris had described this match as a ‘Cup Final’ and his players responded.

Jeremy Clarkson will not face prosecution over the attack on a Top Gear producer which led to him being sacked from the hit BBC show. Police had opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire last month after Clarkson had been filming Top Gear in the area. However, after the victim Oisin Tymon said that he did not want to press charges, officers have now decided to drop the probe without taking action against Clarkson. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further. ‘North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations. ‘Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. ‘However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered. ‘Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.’ The incident, described as a 'fracas' by BBC officials, occurred when Clarkson discovered that the hotel where he was staying could not serve him a hot meal following a day's filming. An official report found that the 54-year-old presenter punched Mr Tymon in the mouth before being dragged away by a witness, causing the producer to go to A&E for emergency treatment. He also verbally abused him for 20 minutes, blaming Mr Tymon for failing to ensure that he could get a steak at the hotel. Victim: Oisin Tymon told police he did not wish to press charges against Mr Clarkson . Mr Clarkson was suspended as Top Gear presenter as soon as news of the fight came to light, and after the report was released the BBC announced that it would not renew his contract. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately, and the producer told North Yorkshire Police he did not want to see Mr Clarkson prosecuted. Despite his sacking, Mr Clarkson is set to take part in a series of Top Gear Live shows alongside co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, although the performances will be rebranded. The BBC has said that Top Gear is likely to continue in some form, but Mr Hammond and Mr May are not expected to return.

The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: ""Has she got a baby in her belly?""' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs . As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer . 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week.

Next step: Jailed millionaire Robert Durst has been absolved of state gun charges in Louisiana. He will now face federal charges, which lawyers believe he can win, before a murder trial in California . He was arrested at a hotel in the New Orleans capital in March a day before the finale of his HBO docu-series The Jinx. Authorities said he had a gun and marijuana in his room. Defense Attorney Dick DeGuerin said state and federal prosecutors had been discussing the possibility of the state case being dismissed. He says he was pleased with the decision. 'It makes sense to try this case in federal court because FBI agents arrested Mr. Durst, and there shouldn't be two prosecutions, state and federal, at the same time for the same crime,' DeGuerin said in an email. 'We're looking forward to our day in court.' A spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro confirmed the move, saying Cannizzaro has a close working relationship with federal authorities in New Orleans. 'The District Attorney did reserve the right to look at the case again upon its conclusion in federal court,' assistant prosecutor Christopher Bowman said.

Durst, the heir to a vast real estate fortune before becoming estranged from his family, is also connected to the 1982 disappearance of first wife Kathy McCormack (left, with Durst) and the killing of Morris Black (right) The charge in the federal indictment says Durst violated the federal gun-control act because he was in possession of a firearm after being convicted of earlier felonies. His lawyers say the arrest in mid-March was timed to mesh with the finale of The Jinx, HBO's six-part series about Durst, his wife's disappearance, Berman's death, and the death and dismemberment of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in 2001. Authorities found more than $44,000 in Durst's hotel room, according to legal papers filed Wednesday. After his arrest, they intercepted a package containing personal items and $117,000 that was sent to the hotel for Everette Ward — the name Durst used to register there.

Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan: 'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers – they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong.

A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. He also claimed he had been tortured during four years in jail in Kandahar after being accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The bodyguard escaped from prison and went into hiding, but claimed that he fled to Britain after Taliban fighters tried to track him down. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But in a controversial move, immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay because he was entitled to asylum and protection under human rights laws. It was ruled that deporting him to Afghanistan would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’.
